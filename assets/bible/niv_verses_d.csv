Song of Solomon,2,16,She My beloved is mine and I am his; he browses among the lilies.
Song of Solomon,2,17,"Until the day breaks and the shadows flee, turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or like a young stag on the rugged hills."
Song of Solomon,3,1,All night long on my bed I looked for the one my heart loves; I looked for him but did not find him.
Song of Solomon,3,2,"I will get up now and go about the city, through its streets and squares; I will search for the one my heart loves. So I looked for him but did not find him."
Song of Solomon,3,3,The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city. “Have you seen the one my heart loves?”
Song of Solomon,3,4,"Scarcely had I passed them when I found the one my heart loves. I held him and would not let him go till I had brought him to my mother’s house, to the room of the one who conceived me."
Song of Solomon,3,5,"Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you by the gazelles and by the does of the field: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires."
Song of Solomon,3,6,"Who is this coming up from the wilderness like a column of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and incense made from all the spices of the merchant?"
Song of Solomon,3,7,"Look! It is Solomon’s carriage, escorted by sixty warriors, the noblest of Israel,"
Song of Solomon,3,8,"all of them wearing the sword, all experienced in battle, each with his sword at his side, prepared for the terrors of the night."
Song of Solomon,3,9,King Solomon made for himself the carriage; he made it of wood from Lebanon.
Song of Solomon,3,10,"Its posts he made of silver, its base of gold. Its seat was upholstered with purple, its interior inlaid with love. Daughters of Jerusalem,"
Song of Solomon,3,11,"come out, and look, you daughters of Zion. Look on King Solomon wearing a crown, the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, the day his heart rejoiced."

Song of Solomon,4,8,"Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, come with me from Lebanon. Descend from the crest of Amana, from the top of Senir, the summit of Hermon, from the lions’ dens and the mountain haunts of leopards."
Song of Solomon,4,9,"You have stolen my heart, my sister, my bride; you have stolen my heart with one glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace."
Song of Solomon,4,10,"How delightful is your love, my sister, my bride! How much more pleasing is your love than wine, and the fragrance of your perfume more than any spice!"
Song of Solomon,4,11,"Your lips drop sweetness as the honeycomb, my bride; milk and honey are under your tongue. The fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon."
Song of Solomon,4,12,"You are a garden locked up, my sister, my bride; you are a spring enclosed, a sealed fountain."
Song of Solomon,4,13,"Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates with choice fruits, with henna and nard,"
Song of Solomon,4,14,"nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with every kind of incense tree, with myrrh and aloes and all the finest spices."
Song of Solomon,4,15,"You are a garden fountain, a well of flowing water streaming down from Lebanon."
Song of Solomon,4,16,"She Awake, north wind, and come, south wind! Blow on my garden, that its fragrance may spread everywhere. Let my beloved come into his garden and taste its choice fruits."
Song of Solomon,5,1,"He I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey; I have drunk my wine and my milk. FriendsEat, friends, and drink; drink your fill of love."
Song of Solomon,5,2,"She I slept but my heart was awake. Listen! My beloved is knocking: “Open to me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my flawless one. My head is drenched with dew, my hair with the dampness of the night.”"
Song of Solomon,5,3,I have taken off my robe— must I put it on again? I have washed my feet— must I soil them again?
Song of Solomon,5,4,My beloved thrust his hand through the latch-opening; my heart began to pound for him.
Song of Solomon,5,5,"I arose to open for my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with flowing myrrh, on the handles of the bolt."
Song of Solomon,5,6,"I opened for my beloved, but my beloved had left; he was gone. My heart sank at his departure. I looked for him but did not find him. I called him but he did not answer."
Song of Solomon,5,7,"The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city. They beat me, they bruised me; they took away my cloak, those watchmen of the walls!"

Song of Solomon,5,9,"Friends How is your beloved better than others, most beautiful of women? How is your beloved better than others, that you so charge us?"
Song of Solomon,5,10,"She My beloved is radiant and ruddy, outstanding among ten thousand."
Song of Solomon,5,11,His head is purest gold; his hair is wavy and black as a raven.
Song of Solomon,5,12,"His eyes are like doves by the water streams, washed in milk, mounted like jewels."
Song of Solomon,5,13,His cheeks are like beds of spice yielding perfume. His lips are like lilies dripping with myrrh.
Song of Solomon,5,14,His arms are rods of gold set with topaz. His body is like polished ivory decorated with lapis lazuli.

Song of Solomon,6,1,"Friends Where has your beloved gone, most beautiful of women? Which way did your beloved turn, that we may look for him with you?"
Song of Solomon,6,2,"She My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to browse in the gardens and to gather lilies."
Song of Solomon,6,3,I am my beloved’s and my beloved is mine; he browses among the lilies.
Song of Solomon,6,4,"He You are as beautiful as Tirzah, my darling, as lovely as Jerusalem, as majestic as troops with banners."

Song of Solomon,6,10,"Friends Who is this that appears like the dawn, fair as the moon, bright as the sun, majestic as the stars in procession?"
Song of Solomon,6,11,"He I went down to the grove of nut trees to look at the new growth in the valley, to see if the vines had budded or the pomegranates were in bloom."
Song of Solomon,6,12,"Before I realized it, my desire set me among the royal chariots of my people."
Song of Solomon,6,13,"Friends Come back, come back, O Shulammite; come back, come back, that we may gaze on you! HeWhy would you gaze on the Shulammite as on the dance of Mahanaim?"
Song of Solomon,7,1,"How beautiful your sandaled feet, O prince’s daughter! Your graceful legs are like jewels, the work of an artist’s hands."

Song of Solomon,7,3,"Your breasts are like two fawns, like twin fawns of a gazelle."
Song of Solomon,7,4,Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes are the pools of Heshbon by the gate of Bath Rabbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon looking toward Damascus.
Song of Solomon,7,5,Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel. Your hair is like royal tapestry; the king is held captive by its tresses.
Song of Solomon,7,6,"How beautiful you are and how pleasing, my love, with your delights!"
Song of Solomon,7,7,"Your stature is like that of the palm, and your breasts like clusters of fruit."
Song of Solomon,7,8,"I said, “I will climb the palm tree; I will take hold of its fruit.” May your breasts be like clusters of grapes on the vine, the fragrance of your breath like apples,"
Song of Solomon,7,9,"and your mouth like the best wine. SheMay the wine go straight to my beloved, flowing gently over lips and teeth."

Song of Solomon,8,1,"If only you were to me like a brother, who was nursed at my mother’s breasts! Then, if I found you outside, I would kiss you, and no one would despise me."
Song of Solomon,8,2,"I would lead you and bring you to my mother’s house— she who has taught me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, the nectar of my pomegranates."
Song of Solomon,8,3,His left arm is under my head and his right arm embraces me.
Song of Solomon,8,4,"Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires."

Song of Solomon,8,11,Solomon had a vineyard in Baal Hamon; he let out his vineyard to tenants. Each was to bring for its fruit a thousand shekels of silver.

Song of Solomon,8,13,"He You who dwell in the gardens with friends in attendance, let me hear your voice!"
Song of Solomon,8,14,"She Come away, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or like a young stag on the spice-laden mountains."

Isaiah,7,3,"Then the LORD said to Isaiah, “Go out, you and your son Shear-Jashub, to meet Ahaz at the end of the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Launderer’s Field."
Isaiah,7,4,"Say to him, ‘Be careful, keep calm and don’t be afraid. Do not lose heart because of these two smoldering stubs of firewood—because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah."
Isaiah,7,5,"Aram, Ephraim and Remaliah’s son have plotted your ruin, saying,"
Isaiah,7,6,"“Let us invade Judah; let us tear it apart and divide it among ourselves, and make the son of Tabeel king over it.”"
Isaiah,7,7,"Yet this is what the Sovereign LORD says: “‘It will not take place, it will not happen,"
Isaiah,7,8,"for the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is only Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people."
Isaiah,7,9,"The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is only Remaliah’s son. If you do not stand firm in your faith, you will not stand at all.’”"
Isaiah,7,10,"Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz,"
Isaiah,7,11,"“Ask the LORD your God for a sign, whether in the deepest depths or in the highest heights.”"
Isaiah,7,12,"But Ahaz said, “I will not ask; I will not put the LORD to the test.”"
Isaiah,7,13,"Then Isaiah said, “Hear now, you house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of humans? Will you try the patience of my God also?"
Isaiah,7,14,"Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel."
Isaiah,7,15,"He will be eating curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right,"
Isaiah,7,16,"for before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste."
Isaiah,7,17,The LORD will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your father a time unlike any since Ephraim broke away from Judah—he will bring the king of Assyria.”
Isaiah,7,18,In that day the LORD will whistle for flies from the Nile delta in Egypt and for bees from the land of Assyria.
Isaiah,7,19,"They will all come and settle in the steep ravines and in the crevices in the rocks, on all the thornbushes and at all the water holes."

Isaiah,7,21,"In that day, a person will keep alive a young cow and two goats."
Isaiah,7,22,"And because of the abundance of the milk they give, there will be curds to eat. All who remain in the land will eat curds and honey."
Isaiah,7,23,"In that day, in every place where there were a thousand vines worth a thousand silver shekels, there will be only briers and thorns."
Isaiah,7,24,"Hunters will go there with bow and arrow, for the land will be covered with briers and thorns."
Isaiah,7,25,"As for all the hills once cultivated by the hoe, you will no longer go there for fear of the briers and thorns; they will become places where cattle are turned loose and where sheep run."
Isaiah,8,1,"The LORD said to me, “Take a large scroll and write on it with an ordinary pen: Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.”"
Isaiah,8,2,So I called in Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah as reliable witnesses for me.
Isaiah,8,3,"Then I made love to the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. And the LORD said to me, “Name him Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz."
Isaiah,8,4,"For before the boy knows how to say ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria.”"
Isaiah,8,5,The LORD spoke to me again:
Isaiah,8,6,"“Because this people has rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and rejoices over Rezin and the son of Remaliah,"
Isaiah,8,7,"therefore the Lord is about to bring against them the mighty floodwaters of the Euphrates— the king of Assyria with all his pomp. It will overflow all its channels, run over all its banks"
Isaiah,8,8,"and sweep on into Judah, swirling over it, passing through it and reaching up to the neck. Its outspread wings will cover the breadth of your land, Immanuel!”"

Isaiah,8,12,"“Do not call conspiracy everything this people calls a conspiracy; do not fear what they fear, and do not dread it."
Isaiah,8,13,"The LORD Almighty is the one you are to regard as holy, he is the one you are to fear, he is the one you are to dread."
Isaiah,8,14,He will be a holy place; for both Israel and Judah he will be a stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall. And for the people of Jerusalem he will be a trap and a snare.
Isaiah,8,15,"Many of them will stumble; they will fall and be broken, they will be snared and captured.”"

Isaiah,8,18,"Here am I, and the children the LORD has given me. We are signs and symbols in Israel from the LORD Almighty, who dwells on Mount Zion."
Isaiah,8,19,"When someone tells you to consult mediums and spiritists, who whisper and mutter, should not a people inquire of their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?"
Isaiah,8,20,"Consult God’s instruction and the testimony of warning. If anyone does not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn."

Isaiah,8,22,"Then they will look toward the earth and see only distress and darkness and fearful gloom, and they will be thrust into utter darkness."

Isaiah,9,15,"the elders and dignitaries are the head, the prophets who teach lies are the tail."
Isaiah,9,16,"Those who guide this people mislead them, and those who are guided are led astray."
Isaiah,9,17,"Therefore the Lord will take no pleasure in the young men, nor will he pity the fatherless and widows, for everyone is ungodly and wicked, every mouth speaks folly. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised."

Isaiah,28,12,"to whom he said, “This is the resting place, let the weary rest”; and, “This is the place of repose”— but they would not listen."

Isaiah,28,24,"When a farmer plows for planting, does he plow continually? Does he keep on breaking up and working the soil?"
Isaiah,28,25,"When he has leveled the surface, does he not sow caraway and scatter cumin? Does he not plant wheat in its place, barley in its plot, and spelt in its field?"
Isaiah,28,26,His God instructs him and teaches him the right way.
Isaiah,28,27,"Caraway is not threshed with a sledge, nor is the wheel of a cart rolled over cumin; caraway is beaten out with a rod, and cumin with a stick."
Isaiah,28,28,"Grain must be ground to make bread; so one does not go on threshing it forever. The wheels of a threshing cart may be rolled over it, but one does not use horses to grind grain."

Isaiah,29,17,"In a very short time, will not Lebanon be turned into a fertile field and the fertile field seem like a forest?"

Isaiah,34,7,"And the wild oxen will fall with them, the bull calves and the great bulls. Their land will be drenched with blood, and the dust will be soaked with fat."

Isaiah,34,9,"Edom’s streams will be turned into pitch, her dust into burning sulfur; her land will become blazing pitch!"
Isaiah,34,10,It will not be quenched night or day; its smoke will rise forever. From generation to generation it will lie desolate; no one will ever pass through it again.
Isaiah,34,11,The desert owl and screech owl will possess it; the great owl and the raven will nest there. God will stretch out over Edom the measuring line of chaos and the plumb line of desolation.
Isaiah,34,12,"Her nobles will have nothing there to be called a kingdom, all her princes will vanish away."
Isaiah,34,13,"Thorns will overrun her citadels, nettles and brambles her strongholds. She will become a haunt for jackals, a home for owls."

Isaiah,34,17,He allots their portions; his hand distributes them by measure. They will possess it forever and dwell there from generation to generation.
Isaiah,35,1,"The desert and the parched land will be glad; the wilderness will rejoice and blossom. Like the crocus,"
Isaiah,35,2,"it will burst into bloom; it will rejoice greatly and shout for joy. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon; they will see the glory of the LORD, the splendor of our God."
Isaiah,35,3,"Strengthen the feeble hands, steady the knees that give way;"
Isaiah,35,4,"say to those with fearful hearts, “Be strong, do not fear; your God will come, he will come with vengeance; with divine retribution he will come to save you.”"
Isaiah,35,5,Then will the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped.
Isaiah,35,6,"Then will the lame leap like a deer, and the mute tongue shout for joy. Water will gush forth in the wilderness and streams in the desert."
Isaiah,35,7,"The burning sand will become a pool, the thirsty ground bubbling springs. In the haunts where jackals once lay, grass and reeds and papyrus will grow."
Isaiah,35,8,And a highway will be there; it will be called the Way of Holiness; it will be for those who walk on that Way. The unclean will not journey on it; wicked fools will not go about on it.
Isaiah,35,9,"No lion will be there, nor any ravenous beast; they will not be found there. But only the redeemed will walk there,"
Isaiah,35,10,"and those the LORD has rescued will return. They will enter Zion with singing; everlasting joy will crown their heads. Gladness and joy will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee away."
Isaiah,36,1,"In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah’s reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them."
Isaiah,36,2,"Then the king of Assyria sent his field commander with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. When the commander stopped at the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Launderer’s Field,"
Isaiah,36,3,"Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went out to him."
Isaiah,36,4,"The field commander said to them, “Tell Hezekiah: “‘This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: On what are you basing this confidence of yours?"
Isaiah,36,5,"You say you have counsel and might for war—but you speak only empty words. On whom are you depending, that you rebel against me?"
Isaiah,36,6,"Look, I know you are depending on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which pierces the hand of anyone who leans on it! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him."
Isaiah,36,7,"But if you say to me, “We are depending on the LORD our God”—isn’t he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, “You must worship before this altar”?"
Isaiah,36,8,"“‘Come now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses—if you can put riders on them!"
Isaiah,36,9,"How then can you repulse one officer of the least of my master’s officials, even though you are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?"
Isaiah,36,10,"Furthermore, have I come to attack and destroy this land without the LORD? The LORD himself told me to march against this country and destroy it.’”"
Isaiah,36,11,"Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to the field commander, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don’t speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall.”"
Isaiah,36,12,"But the commander replied, “Was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things, and not to the people sitting on the wall—who, like you, will have to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine?”"
Isaiah,36,13,"Then the commander stood and called out in Hebrew, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!"
Isaiah,36,14,This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you!
Isaiah,36,15,"Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the LORD when he says, ‘The LORD will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.’"
Isaiah,36,16,"“Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then each of you will eat fruit from your own vine and fig tree and drink water from your own cistern,"
Isaiah,36,17,"until I come and take you to a land like your own—a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards."
Isaiah,36,18,"“Do not let Hezekiah mislead you when he says, ‘The LORD will deliver us.’ Have the gods of any nations ever delivered their lands from the hand of the king of Assyria?"
Isaiah,36,19,Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand?
Isaiah,36,20,Who of all the gods of these countries have been able to save their lands from me? How then can the LORD deliver Jerusalem from my hand?”
Isaiah,36,21,"But the people remained silent and said nothing in reply, because the king had commanded, “Do not answer him.”"
Isaiah,36,22,"Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went to Hezekiah, with their clothes torn, and told him what the field commander had said."
Isaiah,37,1,"When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and went into the temple of the LORD."
Isaiah,37,2,"He sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz."
Isaiah,37,3,"They told him, “This is what Hezekiah says: This day is a day of distress and rebuke and disgrace, as when children come to the moment of birth and there is no strength to deliver them."
Isaiah,37,4,"It may be that the LORD your God will hear the words of the field commander, whom his master, the king of Assyria, has sent to ridicule the living God, and that he will rebuke him for the words the LORD your God has heard. Therefore pray for the remnant that still survives.”"
Isaiah,37,5,"When King Hezekiah’s officials came to Isaiah,"
Isaiah,37,6,"Isaiah said to them, “Tell your master, ‘This is what the LORD says: Do not be afraid of what you have heard—those words with which the underlings of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me."
Isaiah,37,7,"Listen! When he hears a certain report, I will make him want to return to his own country, and there I will have him cut down with the sword.’”"
Isaiah,37,8,"When the field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah."
Isaiah,37,9,"Now Sennacherib received a report that Tirhakah, the king of Cush, was marching out to fight against him. When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah with this word:"
Isaiah,37,10,"“Say to Hezekiah king of Judah: Do not let the god you depend on deceive you when he says, ‘Jerusalem will not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria.’"
Isaiah,37,11,"Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries, destroying them completely. And will you be delivered?"
Isaiah,37,12,"Did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my predecessors deliver them—the gods of Gozan, Harran, Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Tel Assar?"
Isaiah,37,13,"Where is the king of Hamath or the king of Arpad? Where are the kings of Lair, Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah?”"
Isaiah,37,14,Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the temple of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD.
Isaiah,37,15,And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD:
Isaiah,37,16,"“LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth."
Isaiah,37,17,"Give ear, LORD, and hear; open your eyes, LORD, and see; listen to all the words Sennacherib has sent to ridicule the living God."
Isaiah,37,18,"“It is true, LORD, that the Assyrian kings have laid waste all these peoples and their lands."
Isaiah,37,19,"They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods but only wood and stone, fashioned by human hands."
Isaiah,37,20,"Now, LORD our God, deliver us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, LORD, are the only God.”"
Isaiah,37,21,"Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah: “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria,"
Isaiah,37,22,this is the word the LORD has spoken against him: “Virgin Daughter Zion despises and mocks you. Daughter Jerusalem tosses her head as you flee.
Isaiah,37,23,Who is it you have ridiculed and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel!
Isaiah,37,24,"By your messengers you have ridiculed the Lord. And you have said, ‘With my many chariots I have ascended the heights of the mountains, the utmost heights of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars, the choicest of its junipers. I have reached its remotest heights, the finest of its forests."
Isaiah,37,25,I have dug wells in foreign lands and drunk the water there. With the soles of my feet I have dried up all the streams of Egypt.’
Isaiah,37,26,"“Have you not heard? Long ago I ordained it. In days of old I planned it; now I have brought it to pass, that you have turned fortified cities into piles of stone."
Isaiah,37,27,"Their people, drained of power, are dismayed and put to shame. They are like plants in the field, like tender green shoots, like grass sprouting on the roof, scorched before it grows up."
Isaiah,37,28,“But I know where you are and when you come and go and how you rage against me.
Isaiah,37,29,"Because you rage against me and because your insolence has reached my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will make you return by the way you came."
Isaiah,37,30,"“This will be the sign for you, Hezekiah: “This year you will eat what grows by itself, and the second year what springs from that. But in the third year sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit."
Isaiah,37,31,Once more a remnant of the kingdom of Judah will take root below and bear fruit above.
Isaiah,37,32,"For out of Jerusalem will come a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the LORD Almighty will accomplish this."
Isaiah,37,33,“Therefore this is what the LORD says concerning the king of Assyria: “He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow here. He will not come before it with shield or build a siege ramp against it.
Isaiah,37,34,"By the way that he came he will return; he will not enter this city,” declares the LORD."
Isaiah,37,35,"“I will defend this city and save it, for my sake and for the sake of David my servant!”"
Isaiah,37,36,Then the angel of the LORD went out and put to death a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up the next morning—there were all the dead bodies!
Isaiah,37,37,So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there.
Isaiah,37,38,"One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisrok, his sons Adrammelek and Sharezer killed him with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son succeeded him as king."
Isaiah,38,1,"In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to him and said, “This is what the LORD says: Put your house in order, because you are going to die; you will not recover.”"
Isaiah,38,2,"Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD,"
Isaiah,38,3,"“Remember, LORD, how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly."
Isaiah,38,4,Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah:
Isaiah,38,5,"“Go and tell Hezekiah, ‘This is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears; I will add fifteen years to your life."
Isaiah,38,6,And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city.
Isaiah,38,7,“‘This is the LORD’s sign to you that the LORD will do what he has promised:
Isaiah,38,8,I will make the shadow cast by the sun go back the ten steps it has gone down on the stairway of Ahaz.’” So the sunlight went back the ten steps it had gone down.
Isaiah,38,9,A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah after his illness and recovery:
Isaiah,38,10,"I said, “In the prime of my life must I go through the gates of death and be robbed of the rest of my years?”"
Isaiah,38,11,"I said, “I will not again see the LORD himself in the land of the living; no longer will I look on my fellow man, or be with those who now dwell in this world."
Isaiah,38,12,"Like a shepherd’s tent my house has been pulled down and taken from me. Like a weaver I have rolled up my life, and he has cut me off from the loom; day and night you made an end of me."
Isaiah,38,13,"I waited patiently till dawn, but like a lion he broke all my bones; day and night you made an end of me."
Isaiah,38,14,"I cried like a swift or thrush, I moaned like a mourning dove. My eyes grew weak as I looked to the heavens. I am being threatened; Lord, come to my aid!”"
Isaiah,38,15,"But what can I say? He has spoken to me, and he himself has done this. I will walk humbly all my years because of this anguish of my soul."
Isaiah,38,16,"Lord, by such things people live; and my spirit finds life in them too. You restored me to health and let me live."
Isaiah,38,17,Surely it was for my benefit that I suffered such anguish. In your love you kept me from the pit of destruction; you have put all my sins behind your back.
Isaiah,38,18,"For the grave cannot praise you, death cannot sing your praise; those who go down to the pit cannot hope for your faithfulness."
Isaiah,38,19,"The living, the living—they praise you, as I am doing today; parents tell their children about your faithfulness."
Isaiah,38,20,"The LORD will save me, and we will sing with stringed instruments all the days of our lives in the temple of the LORD."
Isaiah,38,21,"Isaiah had said, “Prepare a poultice of figs and apply it to the boil, and he will recover.”"
Isaiah,38,22,"Hezekiah had asked, “What will be the sign that I will go up to the temple of the LORD?”"
Isaiah,39,1,"At that time Marduk-Baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent Hezekiah letters and a gift, because he had heard of his illness and recovery."
Isaiah,39,2,"Hezekiah received the envoys gladly and showed them what was in his storehouses—the silver, the gold, the spices, the fine olive oil—his entire armory and everything found among his treasures. There was nothing in his palace or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them."
Isaiah,39,3,"Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked, “What did those men say, and where did they come from?” “From a distant land,” Hezekiah replied. “They came to me from Babylon.”"
Isaiah,39,4,"The prophet asked, “What did they see in your palace?” “They saw everything in my palace,” Hezekiah said. “There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them.”"
Isaiah,39,5,"Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the LORD Almighty:"
Isaiah,39,6,"The time will surely come when everything in your palace, and all that your predecessors have stored up until this day, will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the LORD."
Isaiah,39,7,"And some of your descendants, your own flesh and blood who will be born to you, will be taken away, and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.”"
Isaiah,39,8,"“The word of the LORD you have spoken is good,” Hezekiah replied. For he thought, “There will be peace and security in my lifetime.”"
Isaiah,40,1,"Comfort, comfort my people, says your God."
Isaiah,40,2,"Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and proclaim to her that her hard service has been completed, that her sin has been paid for, that she has received from the LORD’s hand double for all her sins."
Isaiah,40,3,A voice of one calling: “In the wilderness prepare the way for the LORD; make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
Isaiah,40,4,"Every valley shall be raised up, every mountain and hill made low; the rough ground shall become level, the rugged places a plain."
Isaiah,40,5,"And the glory of the LORD will be revealed, and all people will see it together. For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.”"
Isaiah,40,6,"A voice says, “Cry out.” And I said, “What shall I cry?” “All people are like grass, and all their faithfulness is like the flowers of the field."
Isaiah,40,7,"The grass withers and the flowers fall, because the breath of the LORD blows on them. Surely the people are grass."
Isaiah,40,8,"The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God endures forever.”"
Isaiah,40,9,"You who bring good news to Zion, go up on a high mountain. You who bring good news to Jerusalem, lift up your voice with a shout, lift it up, do not be afraid; say to the towns of Judah, “Here is your God!”"
Isaiah,40,10,"See, the Sovereign LORD comes with power, and he rules with a mighty arm. See, his reward is with him, and his recompense accompanies him."
Isaiah,40,11,He tends his flock like a shepherd: He gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart; he gently leads those that have young.
Isaiah,40,12,"Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, or with the breadth of his hand marked off the heavens? Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket, or weighed the mountains on the scales and the hills in a balance?"
Isaiah,40,13,"Who can fathom the Spirit of the LORD, or instruct the LORD as his counselor?"
Isaiah,40,14,"Whom did the LORD consult to enlighten him, and who taught him the right way? Who was it that taught him knowledge, or showed him the path of understanding?"
Isaiah,40,15,Surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket; they are regarded as dust on the scales; he weighs the islands as though they were fine dust.
Isaiah,40,16,"Lebanon is not sufficient for altar fires, nor its animals enough for burnt offerings."
Isaiah,40,17,Before him all the nations are as nothing; they are regarded by him as worthless and less than nothing.
Isaiah,40,18,"With whom, then, will you compare God? To what image will you liken him?"
Isaiah,40,19,"As for an idol, a metalworker casts it, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold and fashions silver chains for it."
Isaiah,40,20,A person too poor to present such an offering selects wood that will not rot; they look for a skilled worker to set up an idol that will not topple.
Isaiah,40,21,Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood since the earth was founded?
Isaiah,40,22,"He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy, and spreads them out like a tent to live in."
Isaiah,40,23,He brings princes to naught and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing.
Isaiah,40,24,"No sooner are they planted, no sooner are they sown, no sooner do they take root in the ground, than he blows on them and they wither, and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff."
Isaiah,40,25,“To whom will you compare me? Or who is my equal?” says the Holy One.
Isaiah,40,26,"Lift up your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one and calls forth each of them by name. Because of his great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing."
Isaiah,40,27,"Why do you complain, Jacob? Why do you say, Israel, “My way is hidden from the LORD; my cause is disregarded by my God”?"
Isaiah,40,28,"Do you not know? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom."
Isaiah,40,29,He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak.
Isaiah,40,30,"Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall;"
Isaiah,40,31,"but those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint."
Isaiah,41,1,"“Be silent before me, you islands! Let the nations renew their strength! Let them come forward and speak; let us meet together at the place of judgment."
Isaiah,41,2,"“Who has stirred up one from the east, calling him in righteousness to his service? He hands nations over to him and subdues kings before him. He turns them to dust with his sword, to windblown chaff with his bow."
Isaiah,41,3,"He pursues them and moves on unscathed, by a path his feet have not traveled before."
Isaiah,41,4,"Who has done this and carried it through, calling forth the generations from the beginning? I, the LORD—with the first of them and with the last—I am he.”"
Isaiah,41,5,The islands have seen it and fear; the ends of the earth tremble. They approach and come forward;
Isaiah,41,6,"they help each other and say to their companions, “Be strong!”"
Isaiah,41,7,"The metalworker encourages the goldsmith, and the one who smooths with the hammer spurs on the one who strikes the anvil. One says of the welding, “It is good.” The other nails down the idol so it will not topple."
Isaiah,41,8,"“But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, you descendants of Abraham my friend,"
Isaiah,41,9,"I took you from the ends of the earth, from its farthest corners I called you. I said, ‘You are my servant’; I have chosen you and have not rejected you."
Isaiah,41,10,"So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."
Isaiah,41,11,“All who rage against you will surely be ashamed and disgraced; those who oppose you will be as nothing and perish.
Isaiah,41,12,"Though you search for your enemies, you will not find them. Those who wage war against you will be as nothing at all."
Isaiah,41,13,"For I am the LORD your God who takes hold of your right hand and says to you, Do not fear; I will help you."
Isaiah,41,14,"Do not be afraid, you worm Jacob, little Israel, do not fear, for I myself will help you,” declares the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel."
Isaiah,41,15,"“See, I will make you into a threshing sledge, new and sharp, with many teeth. You will thresh the mountains and crush them, and reduce the hills to chaff."
Isaiah,41,16,"You will winnow them, the wind will pick them up, and a gale will blow them away. But you will rejoice in the LORD and glory in the Holy One of Israel."
Isaiah,41,17,"“The poor and needy search for water, but there is none; their tongues are parched with thirst. But I the LORD will answer them; I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them."
Isaiah,41,18,"I will make rivers flow on barren heights, and springs within the valleys. I will turn the desert into pools of water, and the parched ground into springs."
Isaiah,41,19,"I will put in the desert the cedar and the acacia, the myrtle and the olive. I will set junipers in the wasteland, the fir and the cypress together,"
Isaiah,41,20,"so that people may see and know, may consider and understand, that the hand of the LORD has done this, that the Holy One of Israel has created it."
Isaiah,41,21,"“Present your case,” says the LORD. “Set forth your arguments,” says Jacob’s King."
Isaiah,41,22,"“Tell us, you idols, what is going to happen. Tell us what the former things were, so that we may consider them and know their final outcome. Or declare to us the things to come,"
Isaiah,41,23,"tell us what the future holds, so we may know that you are gods. Do something, whether good or bad, so that we will be dismayed and filled with fear."
Isaiah,41,24,But you are less than nothing and your works are utterly worthless; whoever chooses you is detestable.
Isaiah,41,25,"“I have stirred up one from the north, and he comes— one from the rising sun who calls on my name. He treads on rulers as if they were mortar, as if he were a potter treading the clay."
Isaiah,41,26,"Who told of this from the beginning, so we could know, or beforehand, so we could say, ‘He was right’? No one told of this, no one foretold it, no one heard any words from you."
Isaiah,41,27,"I was the first to tell Zion, ‘Look, here they are!’ I gave to Jerusalem a messenger of good news."
Isaiah,41,28,"I look but there is no one— no one among the gods to give counsel, no one to give answer when I ask them."
Isaiah,41,29,"See, they are all false! Their deeds amount to nothing; their images are but wind and confusion."
Isaiah,42,1,"“Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will bring justice to the nations."
Isaiah,42,2,"He will not shout or cry out, or raise his voice in the streets."
Isaiah,42,3,"A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out. In faithfulness he will bring forth justice;"
Isaiah,42,4,he will not falter or be discouraged till he establishes justice on earth. In his teaching the islands will put their hope.”
Isaiah,42,5,"This is what God the LORD says— the Creator of the heavens, who stretches them out, who spreads out the earth with all that springs from it, who gives breath to its people, and life to those who walk on it:"
Isaiah,42,6,"“I, the LORD, have called you in righteousness; I will take hold of your hand. I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people and a light for the Gentiles,"
Isaiah,42,7,"to open eyes that are blind, to free captives from prison and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness."
Isaiah,42,8,“I am the LORD; that is my name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.
Isaiah,42,9,"See, the former things have taken place, and new things I declare; before they spring into being I announce them to you.”"
Isaiah,42,10,"Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise from the ends of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it, you islands, and all who live in them."

Isaiah,42,17,"But those who trust in idols, who say to images, ‘You are our gods,’ will be turned back in utter shame."
Isaiah,42,18,"“Hear, you deaf; look, you blind, and see!"
Isaiah,42,19,"Who is blind but my servant, and deaf like the messenger I send? Who is blind like the one in covenant with me, blind like the servant of the LORD?"
Isaiah,42,20,"You have seen many things, but you pay no attention; your ears are open, but you do not listen.”"
Isaiah,42,21,It pleased the LORD for the sake of his righteousness to make his law great and glorious.
Isaiah,42,22,"But this is a people plundered and looted, all of them trapped in pits or hidden away in prisons. They have become plunder, with no one to rescue them; they have been made loot, with no one to say, “Send them back.”"
Isaiah,42,23,Which of you will listen to this or pay close attention in time to come?
Isaiah,42,24,"Who handed Jacob over to become loot, and Israel to the plunderers? Was it not the LORD, against whom we have sinned? For they would not follow his ways; they did not obey his law."
Isaiah,42,25,"So he poured out on them his burning anger, the violence of war. It enveloped them in flames, yet they did not understand; it consumed them, but they did not take it to heart."
Isaiah,43,1,"But now, this is what the LORD says— he who created you, Jacob, he who formed you, Israel: “Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are mine."
Isaiah,43,2,"When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not set you ablaze."

Isaiah,43,8,"Lead out those who have eyes but are blind, who have ears but are deaf."
Isaiah,43,9,"All the nations gather together and the peoples assemble. Which of their gods foretold this and proclaimed to us the former things? Let them bring in their witnesses to prove they were right, so that others may hear and say, “It is true.”"
Isaiah,43,10,"“You are my witnesses,” declares the LORD, “and my servant whom I have chosen, so that you may know and believe me and understand that I am he. Before me no god was formed, nor will there be one after me."
Isaiah,43,11,"I, even I, am the LORD, and apart from me there is no savior."
Isaiah,43,12,"I have revealed and saved and proclaimed— I, and not some foreign god among you. You are my witnesses,” declares the LORD, “that I am God."

Isaiah,43,18,“Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past.
Isaiah,43,19,"See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland."
Isaiah,43,20,"The wild animals honor me, the jackals and the owls, because I provide water in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland, to give drink to my people, my chosen,"
Isaiah,43,21,the people I formed for myself that they may proclaim my praise.
Isaiah,43,22,"“Yet you have not called on me, Jacob, you have not wearied yourselves for me, Israel."

Isaiah,44,1,"“But now listen, Jacob, my servant, Israel, whom I have chosen."
Isaiah,44,2,"This is what the LORD says— he who made you, who formed you in the womb, and who will help you: Do not be afraid, Jacob, my servant, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen."

Isaiah,44,8,"Do not tremble, do not be afraid. Did I not proclaim this and foretell it long ago? You are my witnesses. Is there any God besides me? No, there is no other Rock; I know not one.”"
Isaiah,44,9,"All who make idols are nothing, and the things they treasure are worthless. Those who would speak up for them are blind; they are ignorant, to their own shame."
Isaiah,44,10,"Who shapes a god and casts an idol, which can profit nothing?"
Isaiah,44,11,People who do that will be put to shame; such craftsmen are only human beings. Let them all come together and take their stand; they will be brought down to terror and shame.
Isaiah,44,12,"The blacksmith takes a tool and works with it in the coals; he shapes an idol with hammers, he forges it with the might of his arm. He gets hungry and loses his strength; he drinks no water and grows faint."
Isaiah,44,13,"The carpenter measures with a line and makes an outline with a marker; he roughs it out with chisels and marks it with compasses. He shapes it in human form, human form in all its glory, that it may dwell in a shrine."
Isaiah,44,14,"He cut down cedars, or perhaps took a cypress or oak. He let it grow among the trees of the forest, or planted a pine, and the rain made it grow."
Isaiah,44,15,"It is used as fuel for burning; some of it he takes and warms himself, he kindles a fire and bakes bread. But he also fashions a god and worships it; he makes an idol and bows down to it."
Isaiah,44,16,"Half of the wood he burns in the fire; over it he prepares his meal, he roasts his meat and eats his fill. He also warms himself and says, “Ah! I am warm; I see the fire.”"
Isaiah,44,17,"From the rest he makes a god, his idol; he bows down to it and worships. He prays to it and says, “Save me! You are my god!”"
Isaiah,44,18,"They know nothing, they understand nothing; their eyes are plastered over so they cannot see, and their minds closed so they cannot understand."
Isaiah,44,19,"No one stops to think, no one has the knowledge or understanding to say, “Half of it I used for fuel; I even baked bread over its coals, I roasted meat and I ate. Shall I make a detestable thing from what is left? Shall I bow down to a block of wood?”"
Isaiah,44,20,"Such a person feeds on ashes; a deluded heart misleads him; he cannot save himself, or say, “Is not this thing in my right hand a lie?”"

They will bow down before you and plead with you, saying, ‘Surely God is with you, and there is no other; there is no other god.’”"
Isaiah,45,15,"Truly you are a God who has been hiding himself, the God and Savior of Israel."
Isaiah,45,16,All the makers of idols will be put to shame and disgraced; they will go off into disgrace together.
Isaiah,45,17,"But Israel will be saved by the LORD with an everlasting salvation; you will never be put to shame or disgraced, to ages everlasting."
Isaiah,45,18,"For this is what the LORD says— he who created the heavens, he is God; he who fashioned and made the earth, he founded it; he did not create it to be empty, but formed it to be inhabited— he says: “I am the LORD, and there is no other."

Isaiah,56,12,"“Come,” each one cries, “let me get wine! Let us drink our fill of beer! And tomorrow will be like today, or even far better.”"
Isaiah,57,1,"The righteous perish, and no one takes it to heart; the devout are taken away, and no one understands that the righteous are taken away to be spared from evil."
Isaiah,57,2,Those who walk uprightly enter into peace; they find rest as they lie in death.
Isaiah,57,3,"“But you—come here, you children of a sorceress, you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes!"
Isaiah,57,4,"Who are you mocking? At whom do you sneer and stick out your tongue? Are you not a brood of rebels, the offspring of liars?"
Isaiah,57,5,You burn with lust among the oaks and under every spreading tree; you sacrifice your children in the ravines and under the overhanging crags.
Isaiah,57,6,"The idols among the smooth stones of the ravines are your portion; indeed, they are your lot. Yes, to them you have poured out drink offerings and offered grain offerings. In view of all this, should I relent?"
Isaiah,57,7,You have made your bed on a high and lofty hill; there you went up to offer your sacrifices.
Isaiah,57,8,"Behind your doors and your doorposts you have put your pagan symbols. Forsaking me, you uncovered your bed, you climbed into it and opened it wide; you made a pact with those whose beds you love, and you looked with lust on their naked bodies."
Isaiah,57,9,You went to Molek with olive oil and increased your perfumes. You sent your ambassadors far away; you descended to the very realm of the dead!
Isaiah,57,10,"You wearied yourself by such going about, but you would not say, ‘It is hopeless.’ You found renewal of your strength, and so you did not faint."
Isaiah,57,11,"“Whom have you so dreaded and feared that you have not been true to me, and have neither remembered me nor taken this to heart? Is it not because I have long been silent that you do not fear me?"
Isaiah,57,12,"I will expose your righteousness and your works, and they will not benefit you."
Isaiah,57,13,"When you cry out for help, let your collection of idols save you! The wind will carry all of them off, a mere breath will blow them away. But whoever takes refuge in me will inherit the land and possess my holy mountain.”"
Isaiah,57,14,"And it will be said: “Build up, build up, prepare the road! Remove the obstacles out of the way of my people.”"
Isaiah,57,15,"For this is what the high and exalted One says— he who lives forever, whose name is holy: “I live in a high and holy place, but also with the one who is contrite and lowly in spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the contrite."
Isaiah,57,16,"I will not accuse them forever, nor will I always be angry, for then they would faint away because of me— the very people I have created."
Isaiah,57,17,"I was enraged by their sinful greed; I punished them, and hid my face in anger, yet they kept on in their willful ways."
Isaiah,57,18,"I have seen their ways, but I will heal them; I will guide them and restore comfort to Israel’s mourners,"
Isaiah,57,19,"creating praise on their lips. Peace, peace, to those far and near,” says the LORD. “And I will heal them.”"

Isaiah,58,1,"“Shout it aloud, do not hold back. Raise your voice like a trumpet. Declare to my people their rebellion and to the descendants of Jacob their sins."
Isaiah,58,2,"For day after day they seek me out; they seem eager to know my ways, as if they were a nation that does what is right and has not forsaken the commands of its God. They ask me for just decisions and seem eager for God to come near them."
Isaiah,58,3,"‘Why have we fasted,’ they say, ‘and you have not seen it? Why have we humbled ourselves, and you have not noticed?’ “Yet on the day of your fasting, you do as you please and exploit all your workers."
Isaiah,58,4,"Your fasting ends in quarreling and strife, and in striking each other with wicked fists. You cannot fast as you do today and expect your voice to be heard on high."
Isaiah,58,5,"Is this the kind of fast I have chosen, only a day for people to humble themselves? Is it only for bowing one’s head like a reed and for lying in sackcloth and ashes? Is that what you call a fast, a day acceptable to the LORD?"
Isaiah,58,6,"“Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen: to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke, to set the oppressed free and break every yoke?"
Isaiah,58,7,"Is it not to share your food with the hungry and to provide the poor wanderer with shelter— when you see the naked, to clothe them, and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood?"
Isaiah,58,8,"Then your light will break forth like the dawn, and your healing will quickly appear; then your righteousness will go before you, and the glory of the LORD will be your rear guard."
Isaiah,58,9,"Then you will call, and the LORD will answer; you will cry for help, and he will say: Here am I. “If you do away with the yoke of oppression, with the pointing finger and malicious talk,"
Isaiah,58,10,"and if you spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of the oppressed, then your light will rise in the darkness, and your night will become like the noonday."
Isaiah,58,11,"The LORD will guide you always; he will satisfy your needs in a sun-scorched land and will strengthen your frame. You will be like a well-watered garden, like a spring whose waters never fail."
Isaiah,58,12,"Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins and will raise up the age-old foundations; you will be called Repairer of Broken Walls, Restorer of Streets with Dwellings."
Isaiah,58,13,"“If you keep your feet from breaking the Sabbath and from doing as you please on my holy day, if you call the Sabbath a delight and the LORD’s holy day honorable, and if you honor it by not going your own way and not doing as you please or speaking idle words,"
Isaiah,58,14,"then you will find your joy in the LORD, and I will cause you to ride in triumph on the heights of the land and to feast on the inheritance of your father Jacob.” For the mouth of the LORD has spoken."
Isaiah,59,1,"Surely the arm of the LORD is not too short to save, nor his ear too dull to hear."
Isaiah,59,2,"But your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear."
Isaiah,59,3,"For your hands are stained with blood, your fingers with guilt. Your lips have spoken falsely, and your tongue mutters wicked things."
Isaiah,59,4,"No one calls for justice; no one pleads a case with integrity. They rely on empty arguments, they utter lies; they conceive trouble and give birth to evil."
Isaiah,59,5,"They hatch the eggs of vipers and spin a spider’s web. Whoever eats their eggs will die, and when one is broken, an adder is hatched."
Isaiah,59,6,"Their cobwebs are useless for clothing; they cannot cover themselves with what they make. Their deeds are evil deeds, and acts of violence are in their hands."
Isaiah,59,7,Their feet rush into sin; they are swift to shed innocent blood. They pursue evil schemes; acts of violence mark their ways.
Isaiah,59,8,The way of peace they do not know; there is no justice in their paths. They have turned them into crooked roads; no one who walks along them will know peace.
Isaiah,59,9,"So justice is far from us, and righteousness does not reach us. We look for light, but all is darkness; for brightness, but we walk in deep shadows."
Isaiah,59,10,"Like the blind we grope along the wall, feeling our way like people without eyes. At midday we stumble as if it were twilight; among the strong, we are like the dead."
Isaiah,59,11,"We all growl like bears; we moan mournfully like doves. We look for justice, but find none; for deliverance, but it is far away."
Isaiah,59,12,"For our offenses are many in your sight, and our sins testify against us. Our offenses are ever with us, and we acknowledge our iniquities:"
Isaiah,59,13,"rebellion and treachery against the LORD, turning our backs on our God, inciting revolt and oppression, uttering lies our hearts have conceived."
Isaiah,59,14,"So justice is driven back, and righteousness stands at a distance; truth has stumbled in the streets, honesty cannot enter."
Isaiah,59,15,"Truth is nowhere to be found, and whoever shuns evil becomes a prey. The LORD looked and was displeased that there was no justice."
Isaiah,59,16,"He saw that there was no one, he was appalled that there was no one to intervene; so his own arm achieved salvation for him, and his own righteousness sustained him."
Isaiah,59,17,"He put on righteousness as his breastplate, and the helmet of salvation on his head; he put on the garments of vengeance and wrapped himself in zeal as in a cloak."
Isaiah,59,18,"According to what they have done, so will he repay wrath to his enemies and retribution to his foes; he will repay the islands their due."
Isaiah,59,19,"From the west, people will fear the name of the LORD, and from the rising of the sun, they will revere his glory. For he will come like a pent-up flood that the breath of the LORD drives along."

Isaiah,61,3,"and provide for those who grieve in Zion— to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair.

Isaiah,63,13,"who led them through the depths? Like a horse in open country, they did not stumble;"

Isaiah,64,7,No one calls on your name or strives to lay hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us and have given us over to our sins.

Isaiah,65,2,"All day long I have held out my hands to an obstinate people, who walk in ways not good, pursuing their own imaginations—"
Isaiah,65,3,"a people who continually provoke me to my very face, offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on altars of brick;"

Isaiah,65,5,"who say, ‘Keep away; don’t come near me, for I am too sacred for you!’ Such people are smoke in my nostrils, a fire that keeps burning all day."
Isaiah,65,6,"“See, it stands written before me: I will not keep silent but will pay back in full; I will pay it back into their laps—"

Isaiah,65,13,"Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: “My servants will eat, but you will go hungry; my servants will drink, but you will go thirsty; my servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame."
Isaiah,65,14,"My servants will sing out of the joy of their hearts, but you will cry out from anguish of heart and wail in brokenness of spirit."
Isaiah,65,15,"You will leave your name for my chosen ones to use in their curses; the Sovereign LORD will put you to death, but to his servants he will give another name."
Isaiah,65,16,Whoever invokes a blessing in the land will do so by the one true God; whoever takes an oath in the land will swear by the one true God. For the past troubles will be forgotten and hidden from my eyes.
Isaiah,65,17,"“See, I will create new heavens and a new earth. The former things will not be remembered, nor will they come to mind."

Isaiah,66,3,"But whoever sacrifices a bull is like one who kills a person, and whoever offers a lamb is like one who breaks a dog’s neck; whoever makes a grain offering is like one who presents pig’s blood, and whoever burns memorial incense is like one who worships an idol. They have chosen their own ways, and they delight in their abominations;"
Isaiah,66,4,"so I also will choose harsh treatment for them and will bring on them what they dread. For when I called, no one answered, when I spoke, no one listened. They did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me.”"

Isaiah,66,7,"“Before she goes into labor, she gives birth; before the pains come upon her, she delivers a son."
Isaiah,66,8,Who has ever heard of such things? Who has ever seen things like this? Can a country be born in a day or a nation be brought forth in a moment? Yet no sooner is Zion in labor than she gives birth to her children.
Isaiah,66,9,Do I bring to the moment of birth and not give delivery?” says the LORD. “Do I close up the womb when I bring to delivery?” says your God.
Isaiah,66,10,"“Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her, all you who love her; rejoice greatly with her, all you who mourn over her."

They will proclaim my glory among the nations."
Isaiah,66,20,"And they will bring all your people, from all the nations, to my holy mountain in Jerusalem as an offering to the LORD—on horses, in chariots and wagons, and on mules and camels,” says the LORD. “They will bring them, as the Israelites bring their grain offerings, to the temple of the LORD in ceremonially clean vessels."

Jeremiah,1,2,"The word of the LORD came to him in the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah,"
Jeremiah,1,3,"and through the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, down to the fifth month of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, when the people of Jerusalem went into exile."
Jeremiah,1,4,"The word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Jeremiah,1,5,"“Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.”"
Jeremiah,1,6,"“Alas, Sovereign LORD,” I said, “I do not know how to speak; I am too young.”"
Jeremiah,1,7,"But the LORD said to me, “Do not say, ‘I am too young.’ You must go to everyone I send you to and say whatever I command you."
Jeremiah,1,8,"Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you and will rescue you,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,1,9,"Then the LORD reached out his hand and touched my mouth and said to me, “I have put my words in your mouth."
Jeremiah,1,10,"See, today I appoint you over nations and kingdoms to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and to plant.”"
Jeremiah,1,11,"The word of the LORD came to me: “What do you see, Jeremiah?” “I see the branch of an almond tree,” I replied."
Jeremiah,1,12,"The LORD said to me, “You have seen correctly, for I am watching to see that my word is fulfilled.”"
Jeremiah,1,13,"The word of the LORD came to me again: “What do you see?” “I see a pot that is boiling,” I answered. “It is tilting toward us from the north.”"
Jeremiah,1,14,"The LORD said to me, “From the north disaster will be poured out on all who live in the land."
Jeremiah,1,15,"I am about to summon all the peoples of the northern kingdoms,” declares the LORD. “Their kings will come and set up their thrones in the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem; they will come against all her surrounding walls and against all the towns of Judah."
Jeremiah,1,16,"I will pronounce my judgments on my people because of their wickedness in forsaking me, in burning incense to other gods and in worshiping what their hands have made."
Jeremiah,1,17,"“Get yourself ready! Stand up and say to them whatever I command you. Do not be terrified by them, or I will terrify you before them."
Jeremiah,1,18,"Today I have made you a fortified city, an iron pillar and a bronze wall to stand against the whole land—against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests and the people of the land."
Jeremiah,1,19,"They will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you and will rescue you,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,2,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Jeremiah,2,2,"“Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem: “This is what the LORD says: “‘I remember the devotion of your youth, how as a bride you loved me and followed me through the wilderness, through a land not sown."
Jeremiah,2,3,"Israel was holy to the LORD, the firstfruits of his harvest; all who devoured her were held guilty, and disaster overtook them,’” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,2,4,"Hear the word of the LORD, you descendants of Jacob, all you clans of Israel."
Jeremiah,2,5,"This is what the LORD says: “What fault did your ancestors find in me, that they strayed so far from me? They followed worthless idols and became worthless themselves."
Jeremiah,2,6,"They did not ask, ‘Where is the LORD, who brought us up out of Egypt and led us through the barren wilderness, through a land of deserts and ravines, a land of drought and utter darkness, a land where no one travels and no one lives?’"
Jeremiah,2,7,I brought you into a fertile land to eat its fruit and rich produce. But you came and defiled my land and made my inheritance detestable.
Jeremiah,2,8,"The priests did not ask, ‘Where is the LORD?’ Those who deal with the law did not know me; the leaders rebelled against me. The prophets prophesied by Baal, following worthless idols."
Jeremiah,2,9,"“Therefore I bring charges against you again,” declares the LORD. “And I will bring charges against your children’s children."
Jeremiah,2,10,"Cross over to the coasts of Cyprus and look, send to Kedar and observe closely; see if there has ever been anything like this:"
Jeremiah,2,11,Has a nation ever changed its gods? (Yet they are not gods at all.) But my people have exchanged their glorious God for worthless idols.
Jeremiah,2,12,"Be appalled at this, you heavens, and shudder with great horror,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,2,13,"“My people have committed two sins: They have forsaken me, the spring of living water, and have dug their own cisterns, broken cisterns that cannot hold water."
Jeremiah,2,14,"Is Israel a servant, a slave by birth? Why then has he become plunder?"
Jeremiah,2,15,Lions have roared; they have growled at him. They have laid waste his land; his towns are burned and deserted.
Jeremiah,2,16,"Also, the men of Memphis and Tahpanhes have cracked your skull."
Jeremiah,2,17,Have you not brought this on yourselves by forsaking the LORD your God when he led you in the way?
Jeremiah,2,18,Now why go to Egypt to drink water from the Nile? And why go to Assyria to drink water from the Euphrates?
Jeremiah,2,19,"Your wickedness will punish you; your backsliding will rebuke you. Consider then and realize how evil and bitter it is for you when you forsake the LORD your God and have no awe of me,” declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty."
Jeremiah,2,20,"“Long ago you broke off your yoke and tore off your bonds; you said, ‘I will not serve you!’ Indeed, on every high hill and under every spreading tree you lay down as a prostitute."
Jeremiah,2,21,"I had planted you like a choice vine of sound and reliable stock. How then did you turn against me into a corrupt, wild vine?"
Jeremiah,2,22,"Although you wash yourself with soap and use an abundance of cleansing powder, the stain of your guilt is still before me,” declares the Sovereign LORD."
Jeremiah,2,23,"“How can you say, ‘I am not defiled; I have not run after the Baals’? See how you behaved in the valley; consider what you have done. You are a swift she-camel running here and there,"
Jeremiah,2,24,"a wild donkey accustomed to the desert, sniffing the wind in her craving— in her heat who can restrain her? Any males that pursue her need not tire themselves; at mating time they will find her."
Jeremiah,2,25,"Do not run until your feet are bare and your throat is dry. But you said, ‘It’s no use! I love foreign gods, and I must go after them.’"
Jeremiah,2,26,"“As a thief is disgraced when he is caught, so the people of Israel are disgraced— they, their kings and their officials, their priests and their prophets."
Jeremiah,2,27,"They say to wood, ‘You are my father,’ and to stone, ‘You gave me birth.’ They have turned their backs to me and not their faces; yet when they are in trouble, they say, ‘Come and save us!’"
Jeremiah,2,28,"Where then are the gods you made for yourselves? Let them come if they can save you when you are in trouble! For you, Judah, have as many gods as you have towns."
Jeremiah,2,29,"“Why do you bring charges against me? You have all rebelled against me,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,2,30,“In vain I punished your people; they did not respond to correction. Your sword has devoured your prophets like a ravenous lion.
Jeremiah,2,31,"“You of this generation, consider the word of the LORD: “Have I been a desert to Israel or a land of great darkness? Why do my people say, ‘We are free to roam; we will come to you no more’?"
Jeremiah,2,32,"Does a young woman forget her jewelry, a bride her wedding ornaments? Yet my people have forgotten me, days without number."
Jeremiah,2,33,How skilled you are at pursuing love! Even the worst of women can learn from your ways.
Jeremiah,2,34,"On your clothes is found the lifeblood of the innocent poor, though you did not catch them breaking in. Yet in spite of all this"
Jeremiah,2,35,"you say, ‘I am innocent; he is not angry with me.’ But I will pass judgment on you because you say, ‘I have not sinned.’"
Jeremiah,2,36,"Why do you go about so much, changing your ways? You will be disappointed by Egypt as you were by Assyria."
Jeremiah,2,37,"You will also leave that place with your hands on your head, for the LORD has rejected those you trust; you will not be helped by them."
Jeremiah,3,1,"“If a man divorces his wife and she leaves him and marries another man, should he return to her again? Would not the land be completely defiled? But you have lived as a prostitute with many lovers— would you now return to me?” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,3,2,"“Look up to the barren heights and see. Is there any place where you have not been ravished? By the roadside you sat waiting for lovers, sat like a nomad in the desert. You have defiled the land with your prostitution and wickedness."
Jeremiah,3,3,"Therefore the showers have been withheld, and no spring rains have fallen. Yet you have the brazen look of a prostitute; you refuse to blush with shame."
Jeremiah,3,4,"Have you not just called to me: ‘My Father, my friend from my youth,"
Jeremiah,3,5,"will you always be angry? Will your wrath continue forever?’ This is how you talk, but you do all the evil you can.”"
Jeremiah,3,6,"During the reign of King Josiah, the LORD said to me, “Have you seen what faithless Israel has done? She has gone up on every high hill and under every spreading tree and has committed adultery there."
Jeremiah,3,7,"I thought that after she had done all this she would return to me but she did not, and her unfaithful sister Judah saw it."
Jeremiah,3,8,I gave faithless Israel her certificate of divorce and sent her away because of all her adulteries. Yet I saw that her unfaithful sister Judah had no fear; she also went out and committed adultery.
Jeremiah,3,9,"Because Israel’s immorality mattered so little to her, she defiled the land and committed adultery with stone and wood."
Jeremiah,3,10,"In spite of all this, her unfaithful sister Judah did not return to me with all her heart, but only in pretense,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,3,11,"The LORD said to me, “Faithless Israel is more righteous than unfaithful Judah."
Jeremiah,3,12,"Go, proclaim this message toward the north: “‘Return, faithless Israel,’ declares the LORD, ‘I will frown on you no longer, for I am faithful,’ declares the LORD, ‘I will not be angry forever."
Jeremiah,3,13,"Only acknowledge your guilt— you have rebelled against the LORD your God, you have scattered your favors to foreign gods under every spreading tree, and have not obeyed me,’” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,3,14,"“Return, faithless people,” declares the LORD, “for I am your husband. I will choose you—one from a town and two from a clan—and bring you to Zion."
Jeremiah,3,15,"Then I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will lead you with knowledge and understanding."
Jeremiah,3,16,"In those days, when your numbers have increased greatly in the land,” declares the LORD, “people will no longer say, ‘The ark of the covenant of the LORD.’ It will never enter their minds or be remembered; it will not be missed, nor will another one be made."
Jeremiah,3,17,"At that time they will call Jerusalem The Throne of the LORD, and all nations will gather in Jerusalem to honor the name of the LORD. No longer will they follow the stubbornness of their evil hearts."
Jeremiah,3,18,"In those days the people of Judah will join the people of Israel, and together they will come from a northern land to the land I gave your ancestors as an inheritance."
Jeremiah,3,19,"“I myself said, “‘How gladly would I treat you like my children and give you a pleasant land, the most beautiful inheritance of any nation.’ I thought you would call me ‘Father’ and not turn away from following me."
Jeremiah,3,20,"But like a woman unfaithful to her husband, so you, Israel, have been unfaithful to me,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,3,21,"A cry is heard on the barren heights, the weeping and pleading of the people of Israel, because they have perverted their ways and have forgotten the LORD their God."
Jeremiah,3,22,"“Return, faithless people; I will cure you of backsliding.” “Yes, we will come to you, for you are the LORD our God."
Jeremiah,3,23,Surely the idolatrous commotion on the hills and mountains is a deception; surely in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel.
Jeremiah,3,24,"From our youth shameful gods have consumed the fruits of our ancestors’ labor— their flocks and herds, their sons and daughters."
Jeremiah,3,25,"Let us lie down in our shame, and let our disgrace cover us. We have sinned against the LORD our God, both we and our ancestors; from our youth till this day we have not obeyed the LORD our God.”"
Jeremiah,4,1,"“If you, Israel, will return, then return to me,” declares the LORD. “If you put your detestable idols out of my sight and no longer go astray,"
Jeremiah,4,2,"and if in a truthful, just and righteous way you swear, ‘As surely as the LORD lives,’ then the nations will invoke blessings by him and in him they will boast.”"
Jeremiah,4,3,This is what the LORD says to the people of Judah and to Jerusalem: “Break up your unplowed ground and do not sow among thorns.
Jeremiah,4,4,"Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, circumcise your hearts, you people of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, or my wrath will flare up and burn like fire because of the evil you have done— burn with no one to quench it."
Jeremiah,4,5,“Announce in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem and say: ‘Sound the trumpet throughout the land!’ Cry aloud and say: ‘Gather together! Let us flee to the fortified cities!’
Jeremiah,4,6,"Raise the signal to go to Zion! Flee for safety without delay! For I am bringing disaster from the north, even terrible destruction.”"
Jeremiah,4,7,A lion has come out of his lair; a destroyer of nations has set out. He has left his place to lay waste your land. Your towns will lie in ruins without inhabitant.
Jeremiah,4,8,"So put on sackcloth, lament and wail, for the fierce anger of the LORD has not turned away from us."
Jeremiah,4,9,"“In that day,” declares the LORD, “the king and the officials will lose heart, the priests will be horrified, and the prophets will be appalled.”"
Jeremiah,4,10,"Then I said, “Alas, Sovereign LORD! How completely you have deceived this people and Jerusalem by saying, ‘You will have peace,’ when the sword is at our throats!”"
Jeremiah,4,11,"At that time this people and Jerusalem will be told, “A scorching wind from the barren heights in the desert blows toward my people, but not to winnow or cleanse;"
Jeremiah,4,12,a wind too strong for that comes from me. Now I pronounce my judgments against them.”
Jeremiah,4,13,"Look! He advances like the clouds, his chariots come like a whirlwind, his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! We are ruined!"
Jeremiah,4,14,"Jerusalem, wash the evil from your heart and be saved. How long will you harbor wicked thoughts?"
Jeremiah,4,15,"A voice is announcing from Dan, proclaiming disaster from the hills of Ephraim."
Jeremiah,4,16,"“Tell this to the nations, proclaim concerning Jerusalem: ‘A besieging army is coming from a distant land, raising a war cry against the cities of Judah."
Jeremiah,4,17,"They surround her like men guarding a field, because she has rebelled against me,’” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,4,18,“Your own conduct and actions have brought this on you. This is your punishment. How bitter it is! How it pierces to the heart!”
Jeremiah,4,19,"Oh, my anguish, my anguish! I writhe in pain. Oh, the agony of my heart! My heart pounds within me, I cannot keep silent. For I have heard the sound of the trumpet; I have heard the battle cry."
Jeremiah,4,20,"Disaster follows disaster; the whole land lies in ruins. In an instant my tents are destroyed, my shelter in a moment."
Jeremiah,4,21,How long must I see the battle standard and hear the sound of the trumpet?
Jeremiah,4,22,“My people are fools; they do not know me. They are senseless children; they have no understanding. They are skilled in doing evil; they know not how to do good.”
Jeremiah,4,23,"I looked at the earth, and it was formless and empty; and at the heavens, and their light was gone."
Jeremiah,4,24,"I looked at the mountains, and they were quaking; all the hills were swaying."
Jeremiah,4,25,"I looked, and there were no people; every bird in the sky had flown away."
Jeremiah,4,26,"I looked, and the fruitful land was a desert; all its towns lay in ruins before the LORD, before his fierce anger."
Jeremiah,4,27,"This is what the LORD says: “The whole land will be ruined, though I will not destroy it completely."
Jeremiah,4,28,"Therefore the earth will mourn and the heavens above grow dark, because I have spoken and will not relent, I have decided and will not turn back.”"
Jeremiah,4,29,At the sound of horsemen and archers every town takes to flight. Some go into the thickets; some climb up among the rocks. All the towns are deserted; no one lives in them.
Jeremiah,4,30,"What are you doing, you devastated one? Why dress yourself in scarlet and put on jewels of gold? Why highlight your eyes with makeup? You adorn yourself in vain. Your lovers despise you; they want to kill you."
Jeremiah,4,31,"I hear a cry as of a woman in labor, a groan as of one bearing her first child— the cry of Daughter Zion gasping for breath, stretching out her hands and saying, “Alas! I am fainting; my life is given over to murderers.”"
Jeremiah,5,1,"“Go up and down the streets of Jerusalem, look around and consider, search through her squares. If you can find but one person who deals honestly and seeks the truth, I will forgive this city."
Jeremiah,5,2,"Although they say, ‘As surely as the LORD lives,’ still they are swearing falsely.”"
Jeremiah,5,3,"LORD, do not your eyes look for truth? You struck them, but they felt no pain; you crushed them, but they refused correction. They made their faces harder than stone and refused to repent."
Jeremiah,5,4,"I thought, “These are only the poor; they are foolish, for they do not know the way of the LORD, the requirements of their God."
Jeremiah,5,5,"So I will go to the leaders and speak to them; surely they know the way of the LORD, the requirements of their God.” But with one accord they too had broken off the yoke and torn off the bonds."
Jeremiah,5,6,"Therefore a lion from the forest will attack them, a wolf from the desert will ravage them, a leopard will lie in wait near their towns to tear to pieces any who venture out, for their rebellion is great and their backslidings many."
Jeremiah,5,7,"“Why should I forgive you? Your children have forsaken me and sworn by gods that are not gods. I supplied all their needs, yet they committed adultery and thronged to the houses of prostitutes."
Jeremiah,5,8,"They are well-fed, lusty stallions, each neighing for another man’s wife."
Jeremiah,5,9,Should I not punish them for this?” declares the LORD. “Should I not avenge myself on such a nation as this?
Jeremiah,5,10,"“Go through her vineyards and ravage them, but do not destroy them completely. Strip off her branches, for these people do not belong to the LORD."
Jeremiah,5,11,"The people of Israel and the people of Judah have been utterly unfaithful to me,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,5,12,"They have lied about the LORD; they said, “He will do nothing! No harm will come to us; we will never see sword or famine."
Jeremiah,5,13,The prophets are but wind and the word is not in them; so let what they say be done to them.”
Jeremiah,5,14,"Therefore this is what the LORD God Almighty says: “Because the people have spoken these words, I will make my words in your mouth a fire and these people the wood it consumes."
Jeremiah,5,15,"People of Israel,” declares the LORD, “I am bringing a distant nation against you— an ancient and enduring nation, a people whose language you do not know, whose speech you do not understand."
Jeremiah,5,16,Their quivers are like an open grave; all of them are mighty warriors.
Jeremiah,5,17,"They will devour your harvests and food, devour your sons and daughters; they will devour your flocks and herds, devour your vines and fig trees. With the sword they will destroy the fortified cities in which you trust."
Jeremiah,5,18,"“Yet even in those days,” declares the LORD, “I will not destroy you completely."
Jeremiah,5,19,"And when the people ask, ‘Why has the LORD our God done all this to us?’ you will tell them, ‘As you have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your own land, so now you will serve foreigners in a land not your own.’"
Jeremiah,5,20,“Announce this to the descendants of Jacob and proclaim it in Judah:
Jeremiah,5,21,"Hear this, you foolish and senseless people, who have eyes but do not see, who have ears but do not hear:"
Jeremiah,5,22,"Should you not fear me?” declares the LORD. “Should you not tremble in my presence? I made the sand a boundary for the sea, an everlasting barrier it cannot cross. The waves may roll, but they cannot prevail; they may roar, but they cannot cross it."
Jeremiah,5,23,But these people have stubborn and rebellious hearts; they have turned aside and gone away.
Jeremiah,5,24,"They do not say to themselves, ‘Let us fear the LORD our God, who gives autumn and spring rains in season, who assures us of the regular weeks of harvest.’"
Jeremiah,5,25,Your wrongdoings have kept these away; your sins have deprived you of good.
Jeremiah,5,26,“Among my people are the wicked who lie in wait like men who snare birds and like those who set traps to catch people.
Jeremiah,5,27,"Like cages full of birds, their houses are full of deceit; they have become rich and powerful"
Jeremiah,5,28,and have grown fat and sleek. Their evil deeds have no limit; they do not seek justice. They do not promote the case of the fatherless; they do not defend the just cause of the poor.
Jeremiah,5,29,Should I not punish them for this?” declares the LORD. “Should I not avenge myself on such a nation as this?
Jeremiah,5,30,“A horrible and shocking thing has happened in the land:
Jeremiah,5,31,"The prophets prophesy lies, the priests rule by their own authority, and my people love it this way. But what will you do in the end?"
Jeremiah,6,1,"“Flee for safety, people of Benjamin! Flee from Jerusalem! Sound the trumpet in Tekoa! Raise the signal over Beth Hakkerem! For disaster looms out of the north, even terrible destruction."
Jeremiah,6,2,"I will destroy Daughter Zion, so beautiful and delicate."
Jeremiah,6,3,"Shepherds with their flocks will come against her; they will pitch their tents around her, each tending his own portion.”"
Jeremiah,6,4,"“Prepare for battle against her! Arise, let us attack at noon! But, alas, the daylight is fading, and the shadows of evening grow long."
Jeremiah,6,5,"So arise, let us attack at night and destroy her fortresses!”"
Jeremiah,6,6,This is what the LORD Almighty says: “Cut down the trees and build siege ramps against Jerusalem. This city must be punished; it is filled with oppression.
Jeremiah,6,7,"As a well pours out its water, so she pours out her wickedness. Violence and destruction resound in her; her sickness and wounds are ever before me."
Jeremiah,6,8,"Take warning, Jerusalem, or I will turn away from you and make your land desolate so no one can live in it.”"
Jeremiah,6,9,"This is what the LORD Almighty says: “Let them glean the remnant of Israel as thoroughly as a vine; pass your hand over the branches again, like one gathering grapes.”"
Jeremiah,6,10,To whom can I speak and give warning? Who will listen to me? Their ears are closed so they cannot hear. The word of the LORD is offensive to them; they find no pleasure in it.
Jeremiah,6,11,"But I am full of the wrath of the LORD, and I cannot hold it in. “Pour it out on the children in the street and on the young men gathered together; both husband and wife will be caught in it, and the old, those weighed down with years."
Jeremiah,6,12,"Their houses will be turned over to others, together with their fields and their wives, when I stretch out my hand against those who live in the land,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,6,13,"“From the least to the greatest, all are greedy for gain; prophets and priests alike, all practice deceit."
Jeremiah,6,14,"They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious. ‘Peace, peace,’ they say, when there is no peace."
Jeremiah,6,15,"Are they ashamed of their detestable conduct? No, they have no shame at all; they do not even know how to blush. So they will fall among the fallen; they will be brought down when I punish them,” says the LORD."
Jeremiah,6,16,"This is what the LORD says: “Stand at the crossroads and look; ask for the ancient paths, ask where the good way is, and walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls. But you said, ‘We will not walk in it.’"
Jeremiah,6,17,"I appointed watchmen over you and said, ‘Listen to the sound of the trumpet!’ But you said, ‘We will not listen.’"
Jeremiah,6,18,"Therefore hear, you nations; you who are witnesses, observe what will happen to them."
Jeremiah,6,19,"Hear, you earth: I am bringing disaster on this people, the fruit of their schemes, because they have not listened to my words and have rejected my law."
Jeremiah,6,20,What do I care about incense from Sheba or sweet calamus from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable; your sacrifices do not please me.”
Jeremiah,6,21,Therefore this is what the LORD says: “I will put obstacles before this people. Parents and children alike will stumble over them; neighbors and friends will perish.”
Jeremiah,6,22,"This is what the LORD says: “Look, an army is coming from the land of the north; a great nation is being stirred up from the ends of the earth."
Jeremiah,6,23,"They are armed with bow and spear; they are cruel and show no mercy. They sound like the roaring sea as they ride on their horses; they come like men in battle formation to attack you, Daughter Zion.”"
Jeremiah,6,24,"We have heard reports about them, and our hands hang limp. Anguish has gripped us, pain like that of a woman in labor."
Jeremiah,6,25,"Do not go out to the fields or walk on the roads, for the enemy has a sword, and there is terror on every side."
Jeremiah,6,26,"Put on sackcloth, my people, and roll in ashes; mourn with bitter wailing as for an only son, for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us."
Jeremiah,6,27,"“I have made you a tester of metals and my people the ore, that you may observe and test their ways."
Jeremiah,6,28,"They are all hardened rebels, going about to slander. They are bronze and iron; they all act corruptly."
Jeremiah,6,29,"The bellows blow fiercely to burn away the lead with fire, but the refining goes on in vain; the wicked are not purged out."
Jeremiah,6,30,"They are called rejected silver, because the LORD has rejected them.”"
Jeremiah,7,1,This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
Jeremiah,7,2,"“Stand at the gate of the LORD’s house and there proclaim this message: “‘Hear the word of the LORD, all you people of Judah who come through these gates to worship the LORD."
Jeremiah,7,3,"This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Reform your ways and your actions, and I will let you live in this place."
Jeremiah,7,4,"Do not trust in deceptive words and say, “This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD!”"
Jeremiah,7,5,"If you really change your ways and your actions and deal with each other justly,"
Jeremiah,7,6,"if you do not oppress the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow and do not shed innocent blood in this place, and if you do not follow other gods to your own harm,"
Jeremiah,7,7,"then I will let you live in this place, in the land I gave your ancestors for ever and ever."
Jeremiah,7,8,"But look, you are trusting in deceptive words that are worthless."
Jeremiah,7,9,"“‘Will you steal and murder, commit adultery and perjury, burn incense to Baal and follow other gods you have not known,"
Jeremiah,7,10,"and then come and stand before me in this house, which bears my Name, and say, “We are safe”—safe to do all these detestable things?"
Jeremiah,7,11,"Has this house, which bears my Name, become a den of robbers to you? But I have been watching! declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,7,12,"“‘Go now to the place in Shiloh where I first made a dwelling for my Name, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of my people Israel."
Jeremiah,7,13,"While you were doing all these things, declares the LORD, I spoke to you again and again, but you did not listen; I called you, but you did not answer."
Jeremiah,7,14,"Therefore, what I did to Shiloh I will now do to the house that bears my Name, the temple you trust in, the place I gave to you and your ancestors."
Jeremiah,7,15,"I will thrust you from my presence, just as I did all your fellow Israelites, the people of Ephraim.’"
Jeremiah,7,16,"“So do not pray for this people nor offer any plea or petition for them; do not plead with me, for I will not listen to you."
Jeremiah,7,17,Do you not see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
Jeremiah,7,18,"The children gather wood, the fathers light the fire, and the women knead the dough and make cakes to offer to the Queen of Heaven. They pour out drink offerings to other gods to arouse my anger."
Jeremiah,7,19,"But am I the one they are provoking? declares the LORD. Are they not rather harming themselves, to their own shame?"
Jeremiah,7,20,"“‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: My anger and my wrath will be poured out on this place—on man and beast, on the trees of the field and on the crops of your land—and it will burn and not be quenched."
Jeremiah,7,21,"“‘This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Go ahead, add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices and eat the meat yourselves!"
Jeremiah,7,22,"For when I brought your ancestors out of Egypt and spoke to them, I did not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices,"
Jeremiah,7,23,"but I gave them this command: Obey me, and I will be your God and you will be my people. Walk in obedience to all I command you, that it may go well with you."
Jeremiah,7,24,"But they did not listen or pay attention; instead, they followed the stubborn inclinations of their evil hearts. They went backward and not forward."
Jeremiah,7,25,"From the time your ancestors left Egypt until now, day after day, again and again I sent you my servants the prophets."
Jeremiah,7,26,But they did not listen to me or pay attention. They were stiff-necked and did more evil than their ancestors.’
Jeremiah,7,27,"“When you tell them all this, they will not listen to you; when you call to them, they will not answer."
Jeremiah,7,28,"Therefore say to them, ‘This is the nation that has not obeyed the LORD its God or responded to correction. Truth has perished; it has vanished from their lips."
Jeremiah,7,29,"“‘Cut off your hair and throw it away; take up a lament on the barren heights, for the LORD has rejected and abandoned this generation that is under his wrath."
Jeremiah,7,30,"“‘The people of Judah have done evil in my eyes, declares the LORD. They have set up their detestable idols in the house that bears my Name and have defiled it."
Jeremiah,7,31,"They have built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to burn their sons and daughters in the fire—something I did not command, nor did it enter my mind."
Jeremiah,7,32,"So beware, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when people will no longer call it Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter, for they will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room."
Jeremiah,7,33,"Then the carcasses of this people will become food for the birds and the wild animals, and there will be no one to frighten them away."
Jeremiah,7,34,"I will bring an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the voices of bride and bridegroom in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, for the land will become desolate."
Jeremiah,8,1,"“‘At that time, declares the LORD, the bones of the kings and officials of Judah, the bones of the priests and prophets, and the bones of the people of Jerusalem will be removed from their graves."
Jeremiah,8,2,"They will be exposed to the sun and the moon and all the stars of the heavens, which they have loved and served and which they have followed and consulted and worshiped. They will not be gathered up or buried, but will be like dung lying on the ground."
Jeremiah,8,3,"Wherever I banish them, all the survivors of this evil nation will prefer death to life, declares the LORD Almighty.’"
Jeremiah,8,4,"“Say to them, ‘This is what the LORD says: “‘When people fall down, do they not get up? When someone turns away, do they not return?"
Jeremiah,8,5,Why then have these people turned away? Why does Jerusalem always turn away? They cling to deceit; they refuse to return.
Jeremiah,8,6,"I have listened attentively, but they do not say what is right. None of them repent of their wickedness, saying, “What have I done?” Each pursues their own course like a horse charging into battle."
Jeremiah,8,7,"Even the stork in the sky knows her appointed seasons, and the dove, the swift and the thrush observe the time of their migration. But my people do not know the requirements of the LORD."
Jeremiah,8,8,"“‘How can you say, “We are wise, for we have the law of the LORD,” when actually the lying pen of the scribes has handled it falsely?"
Jeremiah,8,9,"The wise will be put to shame; they will be dismayed and trapped. Since they have rejected the word of the LORD, what kind of wisdom do they have?"
Jeremiah,8,10,"Therefore I will give their wives to other men and their fields to new owners. From the least to the greatest, all are greedy for gain; prophets and priests alike, all practice deceit."
Jeremiah,8,11,"They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious. “Peace, peace,” they say, when there is no peace."
Jeremiah,8,12,"Are they ashamed of their detestable conduct? No, they have no shame at all; they do not even know how to blush. So they will fall among the fallen; they will be brought down when they are punished, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,8,13,"“‘I will take away their harvest, declares the LORD. There will be no grapes on the vine. There will be no figs on the tree, and their leaves will wither. What I have given them will be taken from them.’”"
Jeremiah,8,14,"Why are we sitting here? Gather together! Let us flee to the fortified cities and perish there! For the LORD our God has doomed us to perish and given us poisoned water to drink, because we have sinned against him."
Jeremiah,8,15,"We hoped for peace but no good has come, for a time of healing but there is only terror."
Jeremiah,8,16,"The snorting of the enemy’s horses is heard from Dan; at the neighing of their stallions the whole land trembles. They have come to devour the land and everything in it, the city and all who live there."
Jeremiah,8,17,"“See, I will send venomous snakes among you, vipers that cannot be charmed, and they will bite you,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,8,18,"You who are my Comforter in sorrow, my heart is faint within me."
Jeremiah,8,19,"Listen to the cry of my people from a land far away: “Is the LORD not in Zion? Is her King no longer there?” “Why have they aroused my anger with their images, with their worthless foreign idols?”"
Jeremiah,8,20,"“The harvest is past, the summer has ended, and we are not saved.”"
Jeremiah,8,21,"Since my people are crushed, I am crushed; I mourn, and horror grips me."
Jeremiah,8,22,Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then is there no healing for the wound of my people?
Jeremiah,9,1,"Oh, that my head were a spring of water and my eyes a fountain of tears! I would weep day and night for the slain of my people."
Jeremiah,9,2,"Oh, that I had in the desert a lodging place for travelers, so that I might leave my people and go away from them; for they are all adulterers, a crowd of unfaithful people."
Jeremiah,9,3,"“They make ready their tongue like a bow, to shoot lies; it is not by truth that they triumph in the land. They go from one sin to another; they do not acknowledge me,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,9,4,"“Beware of your friends; do not trust anyone in your clan. For every one of them is a deceiver, and every friend a slanderer."
Jeremiah,9,5,"Friend deceives friend, and no one speaks the truth. They have taught their tongues to lie; they weary themselves with sinning."
Jeremiah,9,6,"You live in the midst of deception; in their deceit they refuse to acknowledge me,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,9,7,"Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty says: “See, I will refine and test them, for what else can I do because of the sin of my people?"
Jeremiah,9,8,"Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaks deceitfully. With their mouths they all speak cordially to their neighbors, but in their hearts they set traps for them."
Jeremiah,9,9,Should I not punish them for this?” declares the LORD. “Should I not avenge myself on such a nation as this?”
Jeremiah,9,10,"I will weep and wail for the mountains and take up a lament concerning the wilderness grasslands. They are desolate and untraveled, and the lowing of cattle is not heard. The birds have all fled and the animals are gone."
Jeremiah,9,11,"“I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, a haunt of jackals; and I will lay waste the towns of Judah so no one can live there.”"
Jeremiah,9,12,Who is wise enough to understand this? Who has been instructed by the LORD and can explain it? Why has the land been ruined and laid waste like a desert that no one can cross?
Jeremiah,9,13,"The LORD said, “It is because they have forsaken my law, which I set before them; they have not obeyed me or followed my law."
Jeremiah,9,14,"Instead, they have followed the stubbornness of their hearts; they have followed the Baals, as their ancestors taught them.”"
Jeremiah,9,15,"Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: “See, I will make this people eat bitter food and drink poisoned water."
Jeremiah,9,16,"I will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their ancestors have known, and I will pursue them with the sword until I have made an end of them.”"
Jeremiah,9,17,This is what the LORD Almighty says: “Consider now! Call for the wailing women to come; send for the most skillful of them.
Jeremiah,9,18,Let them come quickly and wail over us till our eyes overflow with tears and water streams from our eyelids.
Jeremiah,9,19,The sound of wailing is heard from Zion: ‘How ruined we are! How great is our shame! We must leave our land because our houses are in ruins.’”
Jeremiah,9,20,"Now, you women, hear the word of the LORD; open your ears to the words of his mouth. Teach your daughters how to wail; teach one another a lament."
Jeremiah,9,21,Death has climbed in through our windows and has entered our fortresses; it has removed the children from the streets and the young men from the public squares.
Jeremiah,9,22,"Say, “This is what the LORD declares: “‘Dead bodies will lie like dung on the open field, like cut grain behind the reaper, with no one to gather them.’”"
Jeremiah,9,23,"This is what the LORD says: “Let not the wise boast of their wisdom or the strong boast of their strength or the rich boast of their riches,"
Jeremiah,9,24,"but let the one who boasts boast about this: that they have the understanding to know me, that I am the LORD, who exercises kindness, justice and righteousness on earth, for in these I delight,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,9,25,"“The days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when I will punish all who are circumcised only in the flesh—"
Jeremiah,9,26,"Egypt, Judah, Edom, Ammon, Moab and all who live in the wilderness in distant places. For all these nations are really uncircumcised, and even the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.”"
Jeremiah,10,1,"Hear what the LORD says to you, people of Israel."
Jeremiah,10,2,"This is what the LORD says: “Do not learn the ways of the nations or be terrified by signs in the heavens, though the nations are terrified by them."
Jeremiah,10,3,"For the practices of the peoples are worthless; they cut a tree out of the forest, and a craftsman shapes it with his chisel."
Jeremiah,10,4,They adorn it with silver and gold; they fasten it with hammer and nails so it will not totter.
Jeremiah,10,5,"Like a scarecrow in a cucumber field, their idols cannot speak; they must be carried because they cannot walk. Do not fear them; they can do no harm nor can they do any good.”"
Jeremiah,10,6,"No one is like you, LORD; you are great, and your name is mighty in power."
Jeremiah,10,7,"Who should not fear you, King of the nations? This is your due. Among all the wise leaders of the nations and in all their kingdoms, there is no one like you."
Jeremiah,10,8,They are all senseless and foolish; they are taught by worthless wooden idols.
Jeremiah,10,9,Hammered silver is brought from Tarshish and gold from Uphaz. What the craftsman and goldsmith have made is then dressed in blue and purple— all made by skilled workers.
Jeremiah,10,10,"But the LORD is the true God; he is the living God, the eternal King. When he is angry, the earth trembles; the nations cannot endure his wrath."
Jeremiah,10,11,"“Tell them this: ‘These gods, who did not make the heavens and the earth, will perish from the earth and from under the heavens.’”"
Jeremiah,10,12,But God made the earth by his power; he founded the world by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens by his understanding.
Jeremiah,10,13,"When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar; he makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth. He sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses."
Jeremiah,10,14,Everyone is senseless and without knowledge; every goldsmith is shamed by his idols. The images he makes are a fraud; they have no breath in them.
Jeremiah,10,15,"They are worthless, the objects of mockery; when their judgment comes, they will perish."
Jeremiah,10,16,"He who is the Portion of Jacob is not like these, for he is the Maker of all things, including Israel, the people of his inheritance— the LORD Almighty is his name."
Jeremiah,10,17,"Gather up your belongings to leave the land, you who live under siege."
Jeremiah,10,18,For this is what the LORD says: “At this time I will hurl out those who live in this land; I will bring distress on them so that they may be captured.”
Jeremiah,10,19,"Woe to me because of my injury! My wound is incurable! Yet I said to myself, “This is my sickness, and I must endure it.”"
Jeremiah,10,20,My tent is destroyed; all its ropes are snapped. My children are gone from me and are no more; no one is left now to pitch my tent or to set up my shelter.
Jeremiah,10,21,The shepherds are senseless and do not inquire of the LORD; so they do not prosper and all their flock is scattered.
Jeremiah,10,22,"Listen! The report is coming— a great commotion from the land of the north! It will make the towns of Judah desolate, a haunt of jackals."
Jeremiah,10,23,"LORD, I know that people’s lives are not their own; it is not for them to direct their steps."
Jeremiah,10,24,"Discipline me, LORD, but only in due measure— not in your anger, or you will reduce me to nothing."
Jeremiah,10,25,"Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the peoples who do not call on your name. For they have devoured Jacob; they have devoured him completely and destroyed his homeland."
Jeremiah,11,1,This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
Jeremiah,11,2,“Listen to the terms of this covenant and tell them to the people of Judah and to those who live in Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,11,3,"Tell them that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Cursed is the one who does not obey the terms of this covenant—"
Jeremiah,11,4,"the terms I commanded your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the iron-smelting furnace.’ I said, ‘Obey me and do everything I command you, and you will be my people, and I will be your God."
Jeremiah,11,5,"Then I will fulfill the oath I swore to your ancestors, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey’—the land you possess today.” I answered, “Amen, LORD.”"
Jeremiah,11,6,"The LORD said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: ‘Listen to the terms of this covenant and follow them."
Jeremiah,11,7,"From the time I brought your ancestors up from Egypt until today, I warned them again and again, saying, “Obey me.”"
Jeremiah,11,8,"But they did not listen or pay attention; instead, they followed the stubbornness of their evil hearts. So I brought on them all the curses of the covenant I had commanded them to follow but that they did not keep.’”"
Jeremiah,11,9,"Then the LORD said to me, “There is a conspiracy among the people of Judah and those who live in Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,11,10,"They have returned to the sins of their ancestors, who refused to listen to my words. They have followed other gods to serve them. Both Israel and Judah have broken the covenant I made with their ancestors."
Jeremiah,11,11,"Therefore this is what the LORD says: ‘I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape. Although they cry out to me, I will not listen to them."
Jeremiah,11,12,"The towns of Judah and the people of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they will not help them at all when disaster strikes."
Jeremiah,11,13,"You, Judah, have as many gods as you have towns; and the altars you have set up to burn incense to that shameful god Baal are as many as the streets of Jerusalem.’"
Jeremiah,11,14,"“Do not pray for this people or offer any plea or petition for them, because I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their distress."
Jeremiah,11,15,"“What is my beloved doing in my temple as she, with many others, works out her evil schemes? Can consecrated meat avert your punishment? When you engage in your wickedness, then you rejoice.”"
Jeremiah,11,16,"The LORD called you a thriving olive tree with fruit beautiful in form. But with the roar of a mighty storm he will set it on fire, and its branches will be broken."
Jeremiah,11,17,"The LORD Almighty, who planted you, has decreed disaster for you, because the people of both Israel and Judah have done evil and aroused my anger by burning incense to Baal."
Jeremiah,11,18,"Because the LORD revealed their plot to me, I knew it, for at that time he showed me what they were doing."
Jeremiah,11,19,"I had been like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter; I did not realize that they had plotted against me, saying, “Let us destroy the tree and its fruit; let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name be remembered no more.”"
Jeremiah,11,20,"But you, LORD Almighty, who judge righteously and test the heart and mind, let me see your vengeance on them, for to you I have committed my cause."
Jeremiah,11,21,"Therefore this is what the LORD says about the people of Anathoth who are threatening to kill you, saying, “Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD or you will die by our hands”—"
Jeremiah,11,22,"therefore this is what the LORD Almighty says: “I will punish them. Their young men will die by the sword, their sons and daughters by famine."
Jeremiah,11,23,"Not even a remnant will be left to them, because I will bring disaster on the people of Anathoth in the year of their punishment.”"
Jeremiah,12,1,"You are always righteous, LORD, when I bring a case before you. Yet I would speak with you about your justice: Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why do all the faithless live at ease?"
Jeremiah,12,2,"You have planted them, and they have taken root; they grow and bear fruit. You are always on their lips but far from their hearts."
Jeremiah,12,3,"Yet you know me, LORD; you see me and test my thoughts about you. Drag them off like sheep to be butchered! Set them apart for the day of slaughter!"
Jeremiah,12,4,"How long will the land lie parched and the grass in every field be withered? Because those who live in it are wicked, the animals and birds have perished. Moreover, the people are saying, “He will not see what happens to us.”"
Jeremiah,12,5,"“If you have raced with men on foot and they have worn you out, how can you compete with horses? If you stumble in safe country, how will you manage in the thickets by the Jordan?"
Jeremiah,12,6,"Your relatives, members of your own family— even they have betrayed you; they have raised a loud cry against you. Do not trust them, though they speak well of you."
Jeremiah,12,7,"“I will forsake my house, abandon my inheritance; I will give the one I love into the hands of her enemies."
Jeremiah,12,8,My inheritance has become to me like a lion in the forest. She roars at me; therefore I hate her.
Jeremiah,12,9,Has not my inheritance become to me like a speckled bird of prey that other birds of prey surround and attack? Go and gather all the wild beasts; bring them to devour.
Jeremiah,12,10,Many shepherds will ruin my vineyard and trample down my field; they will turn my pleasant field into a desolate wasteland.
Jeremiah,12,11,"It will be made a wasteland, parched and desolate before me; the whole land will be laid waste because there is no one who cares."
Jeremiah,12,12,"Over all the barren heights in the desert destroyers will swarm, for the sword of the LORD will devour from one end of the land to the other; no one will be safe."
Jeremiah,12,13,They will sow wheat but reap thorns; they will wear themselves out but gain nothing. They will bear the shame of their harvest because of the LORD’s fierce anger.”
Jeremiah,12,14,"This is what the LORD says: “As for all my wicked neighbors who seize the inheritance I gave my people Israel, I will uproot them from their lands and I will uproot the people of Judah from among them."
Jeremiah,12,15,"But after I uproot them, I will again have compassion and will bring each of them back to their own inheritance and their own country."
Jeremiah,12,16,"And if they learn well the ways of my people and swear by my name, saying, ‘As surely as the LORD lives’—even as they once taught my people to swear by Baal—then they will be established among my people."
Jeremiah,12,17,"But if any nation does not listen, I will completely uproot and destroy it,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,13,1,"This is what the LORD said to me: “Go and buy a linen belt and put it around your waist, but do not let it touch water.”"
Jeremiah,13,2,"So I bought a belt, as the LORD directed, and put it around my waist."
Jeremiah,13,3,Then the word of the LORD came to me a second time:
Jeremiah,13,4,"“Take the belt you bought and are wearing around your waist, and go now to Perath and hide it there in a crevice in the rocks.”"
Jeremiah,13,5,"So I went and hid it at Perath, as the LORD told me."
Jeremiah,13,6,"Many days later the LORD said to me, “Go now to Perath and get the belt I told you to hide there.”"
Jeremiah,13,7,"So I went to Perath and dug up the belt and took it from the place where I had hidden it, but now it was ruined and completely useless."
Jeremiah,13,8,Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Jeremiah,13,9,“This is what the LORD says: ‘In the same way I will ruin the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,13,10,"These wicked people, who refuse to listen to my words, who follow the stubbornness of their hearts and go after other gods to serve and worship them, will be like this belt—completely useless!"
Jeremiah,13,11,"For as a belt is bound around the waist, so I bound all the people of Israel and all the people of Judah to me,’ declares the LORD, ‘to be my people for my renown and praise and honor. But they have not listened.’"
Jeremiah,13,12,"“Say to them: ‘This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Every wineskin should be filled with wine.’ And if they say to you, ‘Don’t we know that every wineskin should be filled with wine?’"
Jeremiah,13,13,"then tell them, ‘This is what the LORD says: I am going to fill with drunkenness all who live in this land, including the kings who sit on David’s throne, the priests, the prophets and all those living in Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,13,14,"I will smash them one against the other, parents and children alike, declares the LORD. I will allow no pity or mercy or compassion to keep me from destroying them.’”"
Jeremiah,13,15,"Hear and pay attention, do not be arrogant, for the LORD has spoken."
Jeremiah,13,16,"Give glory to the LORD your God before he brings the darkness, before your feet stumble on the darkening hills. You hope for light, but he will turn it to utter darkness and change it to deep gloom."
Jeremiah,13,17,"If you do not listen, I will weep in secret because of your pride; my eyes will weep bitterly, overflowing with tears, because the LORD’s flock will be taken captive."
Jeremiah,13,18,"Say to the king and to the queen mother, “Come down from your thrones, for your glorious crowns will fall from your heads.”"
Jeremiah,13,19,"The cities in the Negev will be shut up, and there will be no one to open them. All Judah will be carried into exile, carried completely away."
Jeremiah,13,20,"Look up and see those who are coming from the north. Where is the flock that was entrusted to you, the sheep of which you boasted?"
Jeremiah,13,21,What will you say when the LORD sets over you those you cultivated as your special allies? Will not pain grip you like that of a woman in labor?
Jeremiah,13,22,"And if you ask yourself, “Why has this happened to me?”— it is because of your many sins that your skirts have been torn off and your body mistreated."
Jeremiah,13,23,Can an Ethiopian change his skin or a leopard its spots? Neither can you do good who are accustomed to doing evil.
Jeremiah,13,24,“I will scatter you like chaff driven by the desert wind.
Jeremiah,13,25,"This is your lot, the portion I have decreed for you,” declares the LORD, “because you have forgotten me and trusted in false gods."
Jeremiah,13,26,I will pull up your skirts over your face that your shame may be seen—
Jeremiah,13,27,"your adulteries and lustful neighings, your shameless prostitution! I have seen your detestable acts on the hills and in the fields. Woe to you, Jerusalem! How long will you be unclean?”"
Jeremiah,14,1,This is the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought:
Jeremiah,14,2,"“Judah mourns, her cities languish; they wail for the land, and a cry goes up from Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,14,3,"The nobles send their servants for water; they go to the cisterns but find no water. They return with their jars unfilled; dismayed and despairing, they cover their heads."
Jeremiah,14,4,The ground is cracked because there is no rain in the land; the farmers are dismayed and cover their heads.
Jeremiah,14,5,Even the doe in the field deserts her newborn fawn because there is no grass.
Jeremiah,14,6,Wild donkeys stand on the barren heights and pant like jackals; their eyes fail for lack of food.”
Jeremiah,14,7,"Although our sins testify against us, do something, LORD, for the sake of your name. For we have often rebelled; we have sinned against you."
Jeremiah,14,8,"You who are the hope of Israel, its Savior in times of distress, why are you like a stranger in the land, like a traveler who stays only a night?"
Jeremiah,14,9,"Why are you like a man taken by surprise, like a warrior powerless to save? You are among us, LORD, and we bear your name; do not forsake us!"
Jeremiah,14,10,This is what the LORD says about this people: “They greatly love to wander; they do not restrain their feet. So the LORD does not accept them; he will now remember their wickedness and punish them for their sins.”
Jeremiah,14,11,"Then the LORD said to me, “Do not pray for the well-being of this people."
Jeremiah,14,12,"Although they fast, I will not listen to their cry; though they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them. Instead, I will destroy them with the sword, famine and plague.”"
Jeremiah,14,13,"But I said, “Alas, Sovereign LORD! The prophets keep telling them, ‘You will not see the sword or suffer famine. Indeed, I will give you lasting peace in this place.’”"
Jeremiah,14,14,"Then the LORD said to me, “The prophets are prophesying lies in my name. I have not sent them or appointed them or spoken to them. They are prophesying to you false visions, divinations, idolatries and the delusions of their own minds."
Jeremiah,14,15,"Therefore this is what the LORD says about the prophets who are prophesying in my name: I did not send them, yet they are saying, ‘No sword or famine will touch this land.’ Those same prophets will perish by sword and famine."
Jeremiah,14,16,"And the people they are prophesying to will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and sword. There will be no one to bury them, their wives, their sons and their daughters. I will pour out on them the calamity they deserve."
Jeremiah,14,17,"“Speak this word to them: “‘Let my eyes overflow with tears night and day without ceasing; for the Virgin Daughter, my people, has suffered a grievous wound, a crushing blow."
Jeremiah,14,18,"If I go into the country, I see those slain by the sword; if I go into the city, I see the ravages of famine. Both prophet and priest have gone to a land they know not.’”"
Jeremiah,14,19,"Have you rejected Judah completely? Do you despise Zion? Why have you afflicted us so that we cannot be healed? We hoped for peace but no good has come, for a time of healing but there is only terror."
Jeremiah,14,20,"We acknowledge our wickedness, LORD, and the guilt of our ancestors; we have indeed sinned against you."
Jeremiah,14,21,For the sake of your name do not despise us; do not dishonor your glorious throne. Remember your covenant with us and do not break it.
Jeremiah,14,22,"Do any of the worthless idols of the nations bring rain? Do the skies themselves send down showers? No, it is you, LORD our God. Therefore our hope is in you, for you are the one who does all this."
Jeremiah,15,1,"Then the LORD said to me: “Even if Moses and Samuel were to stand before me, my heart would not go out to this people. Send them away from my presence! Let them go!"
Jeremiah,15,2,"And if they ask you, ‘Where shall we go?’ tell them, ‘This is what the LORD says: “‘Those destined for death, to death; those for the sword, to the sword; those for starvation, to starvation; those for captivity, to captivity.’"
Jeremiah,15,3,"“I will send four kinds of destroyers against them,” declares the LORD, “the sword to kill and the dogs to drag away and the birds and the wild animals to devour and destroy."
Jeremiah,15,4,I will make them abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what Manasseh son of Hezekiah king of Judah did in Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,15,5,"“Who will have pity on you, Jerusalem? Who will mourn for you? Who will stop to ask how you are?"
Jeremiah,15,6,"You have rejected me,” declares the LORD. “You keep on backsliding. So I will reach out and destroy you; I am tired of holding back."
Jeremiah,15,7,"I will winnow them with a winnowing fork at the city gates of the land. I will bring bereavement and destruction on my people, for they have not changed their ways."
Jeremiah,15,8,I will make their widows more numerous than the sand of the sea. At midday I will bring a destroyer against the mothers of their young men; suddenly I will bring down on them anguish and terror.
Jeremiah,15,9,"The mother of seven will grow faint and breathe her last. Her sun will set while it is still day; she will be disgraced and humiliated. I will put the survivors to the sword before their enemies,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,15,10,"Alas, my mother, that you gave me birth, a man with whom the whole land strives and contends! I have neither lent nor borrowed, yet everyone curses me."
Jeremiah,15,11,"The LORD said, “Surely I will deliver you for a good purpose; surely I will make your enemies plead with you in times of disaster and times of distress."
Jeremiah,15,12,“Can a man break iron— iron from the north—or bronze?
Jeremiah,15,13,"“Your wealth and your treasures I will give as plunder, without charge, because of all your sins throughout your country."
Jeremiah,15,14,"I will enslave you to your enemies in a land you do not know, for my anger will kindle a fire that will burn against you.”"
Jeremiah,15,15,"LORD, you understand; remember me and care for me. Avenge me on my persecutors. You are long-suffering—do not take me away; think of how I suffer reproach for your sake."
Jeremiah,15,16,"When your words came, I ate them; they were my joy and my heart’s delight, for I bear your name, LORD God Almighty."
Jeremiah,15,17,"I never sat in the company of revelers, never made merry with them; I sat alone because your hand was on me and you had filled me with indignation."
Jeremiah,15,18,"Why is my pain unending and my wound grievous and incurable? You are to me like a deceptive brook, like a spring that fails."
Jeremiah,15,19,"Therefore this is what the LORD says: “If you repent, I will restore you that you may serve me; if you utter worthy, not worthless, words, you will be my spokesman. Let this people turn to you, but you must not turn to them."
Jeremiah,15,20,"I will make you a wall to this people, a fortified wall of bronze; they will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you to rescue and save you,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,15,21,“I will save you from the hands of the wicked and deliver you from the grasp of the cruel.”
Jeremiah,16,1,Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Jeremiah,16,2,“You must not marry and have sons or daughters in this place.”
Jeremiah,16,3,For this is what the LORD says about the sons and daughters born in this land and about the women who are their mothers and the men who are their fathers:
Jeremiah,16,4,"“They will die of deadly diseases. They will not be mourned or buried but will be like dung lying on the ground. They will perish by sword and famine, and their dead bodies will become food for the birds and the wild animals.”"
Jeremiah,16,5,"For this is what the LORD says: “Do not enter a house where there is a funeral meal; do not go to mourn or show sympathy, because I have withdrawn my blessing, my love and my pity from this people,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,16,6,"“Both high and low will die in this land. They will not be buried or mourned, and no one will cut themselves or shave their head for the dead."
Jeremiah,16,7,No one will offer food to comfort those who mourn for the dead—not even for a father or a mother—nor will anyone give them a drink to console them.
Jeremiah,16,8,“And do not enter a house where there is feasting and sit down to eat and drink.
Jeremiah,16,9,"For this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Before your eyes and in your days I will bring an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the voices of bride and bridegroom in this place."
Jeremiah,16,10,"“When you tell these people all this and they ask you, ‘Why has the LORD decreed such a great disaster against us? What wrong have we done? What sin have we committed against the LORD our God?’"
Jeremiah,16,11,"then say to them, ‘It is because your ancestors forsook me,’ declares the LORD, ‘and followed other gods and served and worshiped them. They forsook me and did not keep my law."
Jeremiah,16,12,But you have behaved more wickedly than your ancestors. See how all of you are following the stubbornness of your evil hearts instead of obeying me.
Jeremiah,16,13,"So I will throw you out of this land into a land neither you nor your ancestors have known, and there you will serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.’"
Jeremiah,16,14,"“However, the days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when it will no longer be said, ‘As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the Israelites up out of Egypt,’"
Jeremiah,16,15,"but it will be said, ‘As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the Israelites up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had banished them.’ For I will restore them to the land I gave their ancestors."
Jeremiah,16,16,"“But now I will send for many fishermen,” declares the LORD, “and they will catch them. After that I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them down on every mountain and hill and from the crevices of the rocks."
Jeremiah,16,17,"My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from me, nor is their sin concealed from my eyes."
Jeremiah,16,18,"I will repay them double for their wickedness and their sin, because they have defiled my land with the lifeless forms of their vile images and have filled my inheritance with their detestable idols.”"
Jeremiah,16,19,"LORD, my strength and my fortress, my refuge in time of distress, to you the nations will come from the ends of the earth and say, “Our ancestors possessed nothing but false gods, worthless idols that did them no good."
Jeremiah,16,20,"Do people make their own gods? Yes, but they are not gods!”"
Jeremiah,16,21,“Therefore I will teach them— this time I will teach them my power and might. Then they will know that my name is the LORD.
Jeremiah,17,1,"“Judah’s sin is engraved with an iron tool, inscribed with a flint point, on the tablets of their hearts and on the horns of their altars."
Jeremiah,17,2,Even their children remember their altars and Asherah poles beside the spreading trees and on the high hills.
Jeremiah,17,3,"My mountain in the land and your wealth and all your treasures I will give away as plunder, together with your high places, because of sin throughout your country."
Jeremiah,17,4,"Through your own fault you will lose the inheritance I gave you. I will enslave you to your enemies in a land you do not know, for you have kindled my anger, and it will burn forever.”"
Jeremiah,17,5,"This is what the LORD says: “Cursed is the one who trusts in man, who draws strength from mere flesh and whose heart turns away from the LORD."
Jeremiah,17,6,"That person will be like a bush in the wastelands; they will not see prosperity when it comes. They will dwell in the parched places of the desert, in a salt land where no one lives."
Jeremiah,17,7,"“But blessed is the one who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in him."
Jeremiah,17,8,They will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit.”
Jeremiah,17,9,The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?
Jeremiah,17,10,"“I the LORD search the heart and examine the mind, to reward each person according to their conduct, according to what their deeds deserve.”"
Jeremiah,17,11,"Like a partridge that hatches eggs it did not lay are those who gain riches by unjust means. When their lives are half gone, their riches will desert them, and in the end they will prove to be fools."
Jeremiah,17,12,"A glorious throne, exalted from the beginning, is the place of our sanctuary."
Jeremiah,17,13,"LORD, you are the hope of Israel; all who forsake you will be put to shame. Those who turn away from you will be written in the dust because they have forsaken the LORD, the spring of living water."
Jeremiah,17,14,"Heal me, LORD, and I will be healed; save me and I will be saved, for you are the one I praise."
Jeremiah,17,15,"They keep saying to me, “Where is the word of the LORD? Let it now be fulfilled!”"
Jeremiah,17,16,I have not run away from being your shepherd; you know I have not desired the day of despair. What passes my lips is open before you.
Jeremiah,17,17,Do not be a terror to me; you are my refuge in the day of disaster.
Jeremiah,17,18,"Let my persecutors be put to shame, but keep me from shame; let them be terrified, but keep me from terror. Bring on them the day of disaster; destroy them with double destruction."
Jeremiah,17,19,"This is what the LORD said to me: “Go and stand at the Gate of the People, through which the kings of Judah go in and out; stand also at all the other gates of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,17,20,"Say to them, ‘Hear the word of the LORD, you kings of Judah and all people of Judah and everyone living in Jerusalem who come through these gates."
Jeremiah,17,21,This is what the LORD says: Be careful not to carry a load on the Sabbath day or bring it through the gates of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,17,22,"Do not bring a load out of your houses or do any work on the Sabbath, but keep the Sabbath day holy, as I commanded your ancestors."
Jeremiah,17,23,Yet they did not listen or pay attention; they were stiff-necked and would not listen or respond to discipline.
Jeremiah,17,24,"But if you are careful to obey me, declares the LORD, and bring no load through the gates of this city on the Sabbath, but keep the Sabbath day holy by not doing any work on it,"
Jeremiah,17,25,"then kings who sit on David’s throne will come through the gates of this city with their officials. They and their officials will come riding in chariots and on horses, accompanied by the men of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, and this city will be inhabited forever."
Jeremiah,17,26,"People will come from the towns of Judah and the villages around Jerusalem, from the territory of Benjamin and the western foothills, from the hill country and the Negev, bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings and incense, and bringing thank offerings to the house of the LORD."
Jeremiah,17,27,"But if you do not obey me to keep the Sabbath day holy by not carrying any load as you come through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will kindle an unquenchable fire in the gates of Jerusalem that will consume her fortresses.’”"
Jeremiah,18,1,This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
Jeremiah,18,2,"“Go down to the potter’s house, and there I will give you my message.”"
Jeremiah,18,3,"So I went down to the potter’s house, and I saw him working at the wheel."
Jeremiah,18,4,"But the pot he was shaping from the clay was marred in his hands; so the potter formed it into another pot, shaping it as seemed best to him."
Jeremiah,18,5,Then the word of the LORD came to me.
Jeremiah,18,6,"He said, “Can I not do with you, Israel, as this potter does?” declares the LORD. “Like clay in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand, Israel."
Jeremiah,18,7,"If at any time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down and destroyed,"
Jeremiah,18,8,"and if that nation I warned repents of its evil, then I will relent and not inflict on it the disaster I had planned."
Jeremiah,18,9,"And if at another time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be built up and planted,"
Jeremiah,18,10,"and if it does evil in my sight and does not obey me, then I will reconsider the good I had intended to do for it."
Jeremiah,18,11,"“Now therefore say to the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, ‘This is what the LORD says: Look! I am preparing a disaster for you and devising a plan against you. So turn from your evil ways, each one of you, and reform your ways and your actions.’"
Jeremiah,18,12,"But they will reply, ‘It’s no use. We will continue with our own plans; we will all follow the stubbornness of our evil hearts.’”"
Jeremiah,18,13,Therefore this is what the LORD says: “Inquire among the nations: Who has ever heard anything like this? A most horrible thing has been done by Virgin Israel.
Jeremiah,18,14,Does the snow of Lebanon ever vanish from its rocky slopes? Do its cool waters from distant sources ever stop flowing?
Jeremiah,18,15,"Yet my people have forgotten me; they burn incense to worthless idols, which made them stumble in their ways, in the ancient paths. They made them walk in byways, on roads not built up."
Jeremiah,18,16,Their land will be an object of horror and of lasting scorn; all who pass by will be appalled and will shake their heads.
Jeremiah,18,17,"Like a wind from the east, I will scatter them before their enemies; I will show them my back and not my face in the day of their disaster.”"
Jeremiah,18,18,"They said, “Come, let’s make plans against Jeremiah; for the teaching of the law by the priest will not cease, nor will counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophets. So come, let’s attack him with our tongues and pay no attention to anything he says.”"
Jeremiah,18,19,"Listen to me, LORD; hear what my accusers are saying!"
Jeremiah,18,20,Should good be repaid with evil? Yet they have dug a pit for me. Remember that I stood before you and spoke in their behalf to turn your wrath away from them.
Jeremiah,18,21,"So give their children over to famine; hand them over to the power of the sword. Let their wives be made childless and widows; let their men be put to death, their young men slain by the sword in battle."
Jeremiah,18,22,"Let a cry be heard from their houses when you suddenly bring invaders against them, for they have dug a pit to capture me and have hidden snares for my feet."
Jeremiah,18,23,"But you, LORD, know all their plots to kill me. Do not forgive their crimes or blot out their sins from your sight. Let them be overthrown before you; deal with them in the time of your anger."
Jeremiah,19,1,This is what the LORD says: “Go and buy a clay jar from a potter. Take along some of the elders of the people and of the priests
Jeremiah,19,2,"and go out to the Valley of Ben Hinnom, near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate. There proclaim the words I tell you,"
Jeremiah,19,3,"and say, ‘Hear the word of the LORD, you kings of Judah and people of Jerusalem. This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Listen! I am going to bring a disaster on this place that will make the ears of everyone who hears of it tingle."
Jeremiah,19,4,"For they have forsaken me and made this a place of foreign gods; they have burned incense in it to gods that neither they nor their ancestors nor the kings of Judah ever knew, and they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent."
Jeremiah,19,5,"They have built the high places of Baal to burn their children in the fire as offerings to Baal—something I did not command or mention, nor did it enter my mind."
Jeremiah,19,6,"So beware, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when people will no longer call this place Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter."
Jeremiah,19,7,"“‘In this place I will ruin the plans of Judah and Jerusalem. I will make them fall by the sword before their enemies, at the hands of those who want to kill them, and I will give their carcasses as food to the birds and the wild animals."
Jeremiah,19,8,I will devastate this city and make it an object of horror and scorn; all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff because of all its wounds.
Jeremiah,19,9,"I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and daughters, and they will eat one another’s flesh because their enemies will press the siege so hard against them to destroy them.’"
Jeremiah,19,10,"“Then break the jar while those who go with you are watching,"
Jeremiah,19,11,"and say to them, ‘This is what the LORD Almighty says: I will smash this nation and this city just as this potter’s jar is smashed and cannot be repaired. They will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room."
Jeremiah,19,12,"This is what I will do to this place and to those who live here, declares the LORD. I will make this city like Topheth."
Jeremiah,19,13,"The houses in Jerusalem and those of the kings of Judah will be defiled like this place, Topheth—all the houses where they burned incense on the roofs to all the starry hosts and poured out drink offerings to other gods.’”"
Jeremiah,19,14,"Jeremiah then returned from Topheth, where the LORD had sent him to prophesy, and stood in the court of the LORD’s temple and said to all the people,"
Jeremiah,19,15,"“This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘Listen! I am going to bring on this city and all the villages around it every disaster I pronounced against them, because they were stiff-necked and would not listen to my words.’”"
Jeremiah,20,1,"When the priest Pashhur son of Immer, the official in charge of the temple of the LORD, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things,"
Jeremiah,20,2,he had Jeremiah the prophet beaten and put in the stocks at the Upper Gate of Benjamin at the LORD’s temple.
Jeremiah,20,3,"The next day, when Pashhur released him from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, “The LORD’s name for you is not Pashhur, but Terror on Every Side."
Jeremiah,20,4,"For this is what the LORD says: ‘I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends; with your own eyes you will see them fall by the sword of their enemies. I will give all Judah into the hands of the king of Babylon, who will carry them away to Babylon or put them to the sword."
Jeremiah,20,5,"I will deliver all the wealth of this city into the hands of their enemies—all its products, all its valuables and all the treasures of the kings of Judah. They will take it away as plunder and carry it off to Babylon."
Jeremiah,20,6,"And you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house will go into exile to Babylon. There you will die and be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have prophesied lies.’”"
Jeremiah,20,7,"You deceived me, LORD, and I was deceived; you overpowered me and prevailed. I am ridiculed all day long; everyone mocks me."
Jeremiah,20,8,"Whenever I speak, I cry out proclaiming violence and destruction. So the word of the LORD has brought me insult and reproach all day long."
Jeremiah,20,9,"But if I say, “I will not mention his word or speak anymore in his name,” his word is in my heart like a fire, a fire shut up in my bones. I am weary of holding it in; indeed, I cannot."
Jeremiah,20,10,"I hear many whispering, “Terror on every side! Denounce him! Let’s denounce him!” All my friends are waiting for me to slip, saying, “Perhaps he will be deceived; then we will prevail over him and take our revenge on him.”"
Jeremiah,20,11,But the LORD is with me like a mighty warrior; so my persecutors will stumble and not prevail. They will fail and be thoroughly disgraced; their dishonor will never be forgotten.
Jeremiah,20,12,"LORD Almighty, you who examine the righteous and probe the heart and mind, let me see your vengeance on them, for to you I have committed my cause."
Jeremiah,20,13,Sing to the LORD! Give praise to the LORD! He rescues the life of the needy from the hands of the wicked.
Jeremiah,20,14,Cursed be the day I was born! May the day my mother bore me not be blessed!
Jeremiah,20,15,"Cursed be the man who brought my father the news, who made him very glad, saying, “A child is born to you—a son!”"
Jeremiah,20,16,"May that man be like the towns the LORD overthrew without pity. May he hear wailing in the morning, a battle cry at noon."
Jeremiah,20,17,"For he did not kill me in the womb, with my mother as my grave, her womb enlarged forever."
Jeremiah,20,18,Why did I ever come out of the womb to see trouble and sorrow and to end my days in shame?
Jeremiah,21,1,The word came to Jeremiah from the LORD when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur son of Malkijah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah. They said:
Jeremiah,21,2,“Inquire now of the LORD for us because Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is attacking us. Perhaps the LORD will perform wonders for us as in times past so that he will withdraw from us.”
Jeremiah,21,3,"But Jeremiah answered them, “Tell Zedekiah,"
Jeremiah,21,4,"‘This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I am about to turn against you the weapons of war that are in your hands, which you are using to fight the king of Babylon and the Babylonians who are outside the wall besieging you. And I will gather them inside this city."
Jeremiah,21,5,I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm in furious anger and in great wrath.
Jeremiah,21,6,I will strike down those who live in this city—both man and beast—and they will die of a terrible plague.
Jeremiah,21,7,"After that, declares the LORD, I will give Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials and the people in this city who survive the plague, sword and famine, into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to their enemies who want to kill them. He will put them to the sword; he will show them no mercy or pity or compassion.’"
Jeremiah,21,8,"“Furthermore, tell the people, ‘This is what the LORD says: See, I am setting before you the way of life and the way of death."
Jeremiah,21,9,"Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine or plague. But whoever goes out and surrenders to the Babylonians who are besieging you will live; they will escape with their lives."
Jeremiah,21,10,"I have determined to do this city harm and not good, declares the LORD. It will be given into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will destroy it with fire.’"
Jeremiah,21,11,"“Moreover, say to the royal house of Judah, ‘Hear the word of the LORD."
Jeremiah,21,12,"This is what the LORD says to you, house of David: “‘Administer justice every morning; rescue from the hand of the oppressor the one who has been robbed, or my wrath will break out and burn like fire because of the evil you have done— burn with no one to quench it."
Jeremiah,21,13,"I am against you, Jerusalem, you who live above this valley on the rocky plateau, declares the LORD— you who say, “Who can come against us? Who can enter our refuge?”"
Jeremiah,21,14,"I will punish you as your deeds deserve, declares the LORD. I will kindle a fire in your forests that will consume everything around you.’”"
Jeremiah,22,1,This is what the LORD says: “Go down to the palace of the king of Judah and proclaim this message there:
Jeremiah,22,2,"‘Hear the word of the LORD to you, king of Judah, you who sit on David’s throne—you, your officials and your people who come through these gates."
Jeremiah,22,3,"This is what the LORD says: Do what is just and right. Rescue from the hand of the oppressor the one who has been robbed. Do no wrong or violence to the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place."
Jeremiah,22,4,"For if you are careful to carry out these commands, then kings who sit on David’s throne will come through the gates of this palace, riding in chariots and on horses, accompanied by their officials and their people."
Jeremiah,22,5,"But if you do not obey these commands, declares the LORD, I swear by myself that this palace will become a ruin.’”"
Jeremiah,22,6,"For this is what the LORD says about the palace of the king of Judah: “Though you are like Gilead to me, like the summit of Lebanon, I will surely make you like a wasteland, like towns not inhabited."
Jeremiah,22,7,"I will send destroyers against you, each man with his weapons, and they will cut up your fine cedar beams and throw them into the fire."
Jeremiah,22,8,"“People from many nations will pass by this city and will ask one another, ‘Why has the LORD done such a thing to this great city?’"
Jeremiah,22,9,And the answer will be: ‘Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God and have worshiped and served other gods.’”
Jeremiah,22,10,"Do not weep for the dead king or mourn his loss; rather, weep bitterly for him who is exiled, because he will never return nor see his native land again."
Jeremiah,22,11,"For this is what the LORD says about Shallum son of Josiah, who succeeded his father as king of Judah but has gone from this place: “He will never return."
Jeremiah,22,12,He will die in the place where they have led him captive; he will not see this land again.”
Jeremiah,22,13,"“Woe to him who builds his palace by unrighteousness, his upper rooms by injustice, making his own people work for nothing, not paying them for their labor."
Jeremiah,22,14,"He says, ‘I will build myself a great palace with spacious upper rooms.’ So he makes large windows in it, panels it with cedar and decorates it in red."
Jeremiah,22,15,"“Does it make you a king to have more and more cedar? Did not your father have food and drink? He did what was right and just, so all went well with him."
Jeremiah,22,16,"He defended the cause of the poor and needy, and so all went well. Is that not what it means to know me?” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,22,17,"“But your eyes and your heart are set only on dishonest gain, on shedding innocent blood and on oppression and extortion.”"
Jeremiah,22,18,"Therefore this is what the LORD says about Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah: “They will not mourn for him: ‘Alas, my brother! Alas, my sister!’ They will not mourn for him: ‘Alas, my master! Alas, his splendor!’"
Jeremiah,22,19,He will have the burial of a donkey— dragged away and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem.”
Jeremiah,22,20,"“Go up to Lebanon and cry out, let your voice be heard in Bashan, cry out from Abarim, for all your allies are crushed."
Jeremiah,22,21,"I warned you when you felt secure, but you said, ‘I will not listen!’ This has been your way from your youth; you have not obeyed me."
Jeremiah,22,22,"The wind will drive all your shepherds away, and your allies will go into exile. Then you will be ashamed and disgraced because of all your wickedness."
Jeremiah,22,23,"You who live in ‘Lebanon,’ who are nestled in cedar buildings, how you will groan when pangs come upon you, pain like that of a woman in labor!"
Jeremiah,22,24,"“As surely as I live,” declares the LORD, “even if you, Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, were a signet ring on my right hand, I would still pull you off."
Jeremiah,22,25,"I will deliver you into the hands of those who want to kill you, those you fear—Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and the Babylonians."
Jeremiah,22,26,"I will hurl you and the mother who gave you birth into another country, where neither of you was born, and there you both will die."
Jeremiah,22,27,You will never come back to the land you long to return to.”
Jeremiah,22,28,"Is this man Jehoiachin a despised, broken pot, an object no one wants? Why will he and his children be hurled out, cast into a land they do not know?"
Jeremiah,22,29,"O land, land, land, hear the word of the LORD!"
Jeremiah,22,30,"This is what the LORD says: “Record this man as if childless, a man who will not prosper in his lifetime, for none of his offspring will prosper, none will sit on the throne of David or rule anymore in Judah.”"
Jeremiah,23,1,“Woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of my pasture!” declares the LORD.
Jeremiah,23,2,"Therefore this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to the shepherds who tend my people: “Because you have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not bestowed care on them, I will bestow punishment on you for the evil you have done,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,3,"“I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them and will bring them back to their pasture, where they will be fruitful and increase in number."
Jeremiah,23,4,"I will place shepherds over them who will tend them, and they will no longer be afraid or terrified, nor will any be missing,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,5,"“The days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, a King who will reign wisely and do what is just and right in the land."
Jeremiah,23,6,In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. This is the name by which he will be called: The LORD Our Righteous Savior.
Jeremiah,23,7,"“So then, the days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when people will no longer say, ‘As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the Israelites up out of Egypt,’"
Jeremiah,23,8,"but they will say, ‘As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the descendants of Israel up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had banished them.’ Then they will live in their own land.”"
Jeremiah,23,9,"Concerning the prophets: My heart is broken within me; all my bones tremble. I am like a drunken man, like a strong man overcome by wine, because of the LORD and his holy words."
Jeremiah,23,10,The land is full of adulterers; because of the curse the land lies parched and the pastures in the wilderness are withered. The prophets follow an evil course and use their power unjustly.
Jeremiah,23,11,"“Both prophet and priest are godless; even in my temple I find their wickedness,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,12,"“Therefore their path will become slippery; they will be banished to darkness and there they will fall. I will bring disaster on them in the year they are punished,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,13,“Among the prophets of Samaria I saw this repulsive thing: They prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel astray.
Jeremiah,23,14,"And among the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen something horrible: They commit adultery and live a lie. They strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that not one of them turns from their wickedness. They are all like Sodom to me; the people of Jerusalem are like Gomorrah.”"
Jeremiah,23,15,"Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty says concerning the prophets: “I will make them eat bitter food and drink poisoned water, because from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has spread throughout the land.”"
Jeremiah,23,16,"This is what the LORD Almighty says: “Do not listen to what the prophets are prophesying to you; they fill you with false hopes. They speak visions from their own minds, not from the mouth of the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,17,"They keep saying to those who despise me, ‘The LORD says: You will have peace.’ And to all who follow the stubbornness of their hearts they say, ‘No harm will come to you.’"
Jeremiah,23,18,But which of them has stood in the council of the LORD to see or to hear his word? Who has listened and heard his word?
Jeremiah,23,19,"See, the storm of the LORD will burst out in wrath, a whirlwind swirling down on the heads of the wicked."
Jeremiah,23,20,The anger of the LORD will not turn back until he fully accomplishes the purposes of his heart. In days to come you will understand it clearly.
Jeremiah,23,21,"I did not send these prophets, yet they have run with their message; I did not speak to them, yet they have prophesied."
Jeremiah,23,22,"But if they had stood in my council, they would have proclaimed my words to my people and would have turned them from their evil ways and from their evil deeds."
Jeremiah,23,23,"“Am I only a God nearby,” declares the LORD, “and not a God far away?"
Jeremiah,23,24,Who can hide in secret places so that I cannot see them?” declares the LORD. “Do not I fill heaven and earth?” declares the LORD.
Jeremiah,23,25,"“I have heard what the prophets say who prophesy lies in my name. They say, ‘I had a dream! I had a dream!’"
Jeremiah,23,26,"How long will this continue in the hearts of these lying prophets, who prophesy the delusions of their own minds?"
Jeremiah,23,27,"They think the dreams they tell one another will make my people forget my name, just as their ancestors forgot my name through Baal worship."
Jeremiah,23,28,"Let the prophet who has a dream recount the dream, but let the one who has my word speak it faithfully. For what has straw to do with grain?” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,29,"“Is not my word like fire,” declares the LORD, “and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces?"
Jeremiah,23,30,"“Therefore,” declares the LORD, “I am against the prophets who steal from one another words supposedly from me."
Jeremiah,23,31,"Yes,” declares the LORD, “I am against the prophets who wag their own tongues and yet declare, ‘The LORD declares.’"
Jeremiah,23,32,"Indeed, I am against those who prophesy false dreams,” declares the LORD. “They tell them and lead my people astray with their reckless lies, yet I did not send or appoint them. They do not benefit these people in the least,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,33,"“When these people, or a prophet or a priest, ask you, ‘What is the message from the LORD?’ say to them, ‘What message? I will forsake you, declares the LORD.’"
Jeremiah,23,34,"If a prophet or a priest or anyone else claims, ‘This is a message from the LORD,’ I will punish them and their household."
Jeremiah,23,35,This is what each of you keeps saying to your friends and other Israelites: ‘What is the LORD’s answer?’ or ‘What has the LORD spoken?’
Jeremiah,23,36,"But you must not mention ‘a message from the LORD’ again, because each one’s word becomes their own message. So you distort the words of the living God, the LORD Almighty, our God."
Jeremiah,23,37,This is what you keep saying to a prophet: ‘What is the LORD’s answer to you?’ or ‘What has the LORD spoken?’
Jeremiah,23,38,"Although you claim, ‘This is a message from the LORD,’ this is what the LORD says: You used the words, ‘This is a message from the LORD,’ even though I told you that you must not claim, ‘This is a message from the LORD.’"
Jeremiah,23,39,"Therefore, I will surely forget you and cast you out of my presence along with the city I gave to you and your ancestors."
Jeremiah,23,40,I will bring on you everlasting disgrace—everlasting shame that will not be forgotten.”
Jeremiah,24,1,"After Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and the officials, the skilled workers and the artisans of Judah were carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the LORD showed me two baskets of figs placed in front of the temple of the LORD."
Jeremiah,24,2,"One basket had very good figs, like those that ripen early; the other basket had very bad figs, so bad they could not be eaten."
Jeremiah,24,3,"Then the LORD asked me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” “Figs,” I answered. “The good ones are very good, but the bad ones are so bad they cannot be eaten.”"
Jeremiah,24,4,Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Jeremiah,24,5,"“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Like these good figs, I regard as good the exiles from Judah, whom I sent away from this place to the land of the Babylonians."
Jeremiah,24,6,"My eyes will watch over them for their good, and I will bring them back to this land. I will build them up and not tear them down; I will plant them and not uproot them."
Jeremiah,24,7,"I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the LORD. They will be my people, and I will be their God, for they will return to me with all their heart."
Jeremiah,24,8,"“‘But like the bad figs, which are so bad they cannot be eaten,’ says the LORD, ‘so will I deal with Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials and the survivors from Jerusalem, whether they remain in this land or live in Egypt."
Jeremiah,24,9,"I will make them abhorrent and an offense to all the kingdoms of the earth, a reproach and a byword, a curse and an object of ridicule, wherever I banish them."
Jeremiah,24,10,"I will send the sword, famine and plague against them until they are destroyed from the land I gave to them and their ancestors.’”"
Jeremiah,25,1,"The word came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,25,2,So Jeremiah the prophet said to all the people of Judah and to all those living in Jerusalem:
Jeremiah,25,3,"For twenty-three years—from the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah until this very day—the word of the LORD has come to me and I have spoken to you again and again, but you have not listened."
Jeremiah,25,4,"And though the LORD has sent all his servants the prophets to you again and again, you have not listened or paid any attention."
Jeremiah,25,5,"They said, “Turn now, each of you, from your evil ways and your evil practices, and you can stay in the land the LORD gave to you and your ancestors for ever and ever."
Jeremiah,25,6,Do not follow other gods to serve and worship them; do not arouse my anger with what your hands have made. Then I will not harm you.”
Jeremiah,25,7,"“But you did not listen to me,” declares the LORD, “and you have aroused my anger with what your hands have made, and you have brought harm to yourselves.”"
Jeremiah,25,8,"Therefore the LORD Almighty says this: “Because you have not listened to my words,"
Jeremiah,25,9,"I will summon all the peoples of the north and my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,” declares the LORD, “and I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants and against all the surrounding nations. I will completely destroy them and make them an object of horror and scorn, and an everlasting ruin."
Jeremiah,25,10,"I will banish from them the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of bride and bridegroom, the sound of millstones and the light of the lamp."
Jeremiah,25,11,"This whole country will become a desolate wasteland, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years."
Jeremiah,25,12,"“But when the seventy years are fulfilled, I will punish the king of Babylon and his nation, the land of the Babylonians, for their guilt,” declares the LORD, “and will make it desolate forever."
Jeremiah,25,13,"I will bring on that land all the things I have spoken against it, all that are written in this book and prophesied by Jeremiah against all the nations."
Jeremiah,25,14,They themselves will be enslaved by many nations and great kings; I will repay them according to their deeds and the work of their hands.”
Jeremiah,25,15,"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, said to me: “Take from my hand this cup filled with the wine of my wrath and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it."
Jeremiah,25,16,"When they drink it, they will stagger and go mad because of the sword I will send among them.”"
Jeremiah,25,17,So I took the cup from the LORD’s hand and made all the nations to whom he sent me drink it:
Jeremiah,25,18,"Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, its kings and officials, to make them a ruin and an object of horror and scorn, a curse—as they are today;"
Jeremiah,25,19,"Pharaoh king of Egypt, his attendants, his officials and all his people,"
Jeremiah,25,20,"and all the foreign people there; all the kings of Uz; all the kings of the Philistines (those of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the people left at Ashdod);"
Jeremiah,25,21,"Edom, Moab and Ammon;"
Jeremiah,25,22,all the kings of Tyre and Sidon; the kings of the coastlands across the sea;
Jeremiah,25,23,"Dedan, Tema, Buz and all who are in distant places;"
Jeremiah,25,24,all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the foreign people who live in the wilderness;
Jeremiah,25,25,"all the kings of Zimri, Elam and Media;"
Jeremiah,25,26,"and all the kings of the north, near and far, one after the other—all the kingdoms on the face of the earth. And after all of them, the king of Sheshak will drink it too."
Jeremiah,25,27,"“Then tell them, ‘This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Drink, get drunk and vomit, and fall to rise no more because of the sword I will send among you.’"
Jeremiah,25,28,"But if they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink, tell them, ‘This is what the LORD Almighty says: You must drink it!"
Jeremiah,25,29,"See, I am beginning to bring disaster on the city that bears my Name, and will you indeed go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for I am calling down a sword on all who live on the earth, declares the LORD Almighty.’"
Jeremiah,25,30,"“Now prophesy all these words against them and say to them: “‘The LORD will roar from on high; he will thunder from his holy dwelling and roar mightily against his land. He will shout like those who tread the grapes, shout against all who live on the earth."
Jeremiah,25,31,"The tumult will resound to the ends of the earth, for the LORD will bring charges against the nations; he will bring judgment on all mankind and put the wicked to the sword,’” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,25,32,This is what the LORD Almighty says: “Look! Disaster is spreading from nation to nation; a mighty storm is rising from the ends of the earth.”
Jeremiah,25,33,"At that time those slain by the LORD will be everywhere—from one end of the earth to the other. They will not be mourned or gathered up or buried, but will be like dung lying on the ground."
Jeremiah,25,34,"Weep and wail, you shepherds; roll in the dust, you leaders of the flock. For your time to be slaughtered has come; you will fall like the best of the rams."
Jeremiah,25,35,"The shepherds will have nowhere to flee, the leaders of the flock no place to escape."
Jeremiah,25,36,"Hear the cry of the shepherds, the wailing of the leaders of the flock, for the LORD is destroying their pasture."
Jeremiah,25,37,The peaceful meadows will be laid waste because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
Jeremiah,25,38,"Like a lion he will leave his lair, and their land will become desolate because of the sword of the oppressor and because of the LORD’s fierce anger."
Jeremiah,26,1,"Early in the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came from the LORD:"
Jeremiah,26,2,“This is what the LORD says: Stand in the courtyard of the LORD’s house and speak to all the people of the towns of Judah who come to worship in the house of the LORD. Tell them everything I command you; do not omit a word.
Jeremiah,26,3,Perhaps they will listen and each will turn from their evil ways. Then I will relent and not inflict on them the disaster I was planning because of the evil they have done.
Jeremiah,26,4,"Say to them, ‘This is what the LORD says: If you do not listen to me and follow my law, which I have set before you,"
Jeremiah,26,5,"and if you do not listen to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I have sent to you again and again (though you have not listened),"
Jeremiah,26,6,then I will make this house like Shiloh and this city a curse among all the nations of the earth.’”
Jeremiah,26,7,"The priests, the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speak these words in the house of the LORD."
Jeremiah,26,8,"But as soon as Jeremiah finished telling all the people everything the LORD had commanded him to say, the priests, the prophets and all the people seized him and said, “You must die!"
Jeremiah,26,9,Why do you prophesy in the LORD’s name that this house will be like Shiloh and this city will be desolate and deserted?” And all the people crowded around Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.
Jeremiah,26,10,"When the officials of Judah heard about these things, they went up from the royal palace to the house of the LORD and took their places at the entrance of the New Gate of the LORD’s house."
Jeremiah,26,11,"Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and all the people, “This man should be sentenced to death because he has prophesied against this city. You have heard it with your own ears!”"
Jeremiah,26,12,Then Jeremiah said to all the officials and all the people: “The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the things you have heard.
Jeremiah,26,13,Now reform your ways and your actions and obey the LORD your God. Then the LORD will relent and not bring the disaster he has pronounced against you.
Jeremiah,26,14,"As for me, I am in your hands; do with me whatever you think is good and right."
Jeremiah,26,15,"Be assured, however, that if you put me to death, you will bring the guilt of innocent blood on yourselves and on this city and on those who live in it, for in truth the LORD has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing.”"
Jeremiah,26,16,"Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, “This man should not be sentenced to death! He has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.”"
Jeremiah,26,17,"Some of the elders of the land stepped forward and said to the entire assembly of people,"
Jeremiah,26,18,"“Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah. He told all the people of Judah, ‘This is what the LORD Almighty says: “‘Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, the temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets.’"
Jeremiah,26,19,"“Did Hezekiah king of Judah or anyone else in Judah put him to death? Did not Hezekiah fear the LORD and seek his favor? And did not the LORD relent, so that he did not bring the disaster he pronounced against them? We are about to bring a terrible disaster on ourselves!”"
Jeremiah,26,20,(Now Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath Jearim was another man who prophesied in the name of the LORD; he prophesied the same things against this city and this land as Jeremiah did.
Jeremiah,26,21,"When King Jehoiakim and all his officers and officials heard his words, the king was determined to put him to death. But Uriah heard of it and fled in fear to Egypt."
Jeremiah,26,22,"King Jehoiakim, however, sent Elnathan son of Akbor to Egypt, along with some other men."
Jeremiah,26,23,"They brought Uriah out of Egypt and took him to King Jehoiakim, who had him struck down with a sword and his body thrown into the burial place of the common people.)"
Jeremiah,26,24,"Furthermore, Ahikam son of Shaphan supported Jeremiah, and so he was not handed over to the people to be put to death."
Jeremiah,27,1,"Early in the reign of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD:"
Jeremiah,27,2,This is what the LORD said to me: “Make a yoke out of straps and crossbars and put it on your neck.
Jeremiah,27,3,"Then send word to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre and Sidon through the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah."
Jeremiah,27,4,"Give them a message for their masters and say, ‘This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: “Tell this to your masters:"
Jeremiah,27,5,"With my great power and outstretched arm I made the earth and its people and the animals that are on it, and I give it to anyone I please."
Jeremiah,27,6,Now I will give all your countries into the hands of my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; I will make even the wild animals subject to him.
Jeremiah,27,7,All nations will serve him and his son and his grandson until the time for his land comes; then many nations and great kings will subjugate him.
Jeremiah,27,8,"“‘“If, however, any nation or kingdom will not serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon or bow its neck under his yoke, I will punish that nation with the sword, famine and plague, declares the LORD, until I destroy it by his hand."
Jeremiah,27,9,"So do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your interpreters of dreams, your mediums or your sorcerers who tell you, ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon.’"
Jeremiah,27,10,They prophesy lies to you that will only serve to remove you far from your lands; I will banish you and you will perish.
Jeremiah,27,11,"But if any nation will bow its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will let that nation remain in its own land to till it and to live there, declares the LORD.”’”"
Jeremiah,27,12,"I gave the same message to Zedekiah king of Judah. I said, “Bow your neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon; serve him and his people, and you will live."
Jeremiah,27,13,"Why will you and your people die by the sword, famine and plague with which the LORD has threatened any nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?"
Jeremiah,27,14,"Do not listen to the words of the prophets who say to you, ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they are prophesying lies to you."
Jeremiah,27,15,"‘I have not sent them,’ declares the LORD. ‘They are prophesying lies in my name. Therefore, I will banish you and you will perish, both you and the prophets who prophesy to you.’”"
Jeremiah,27,16,"Then I said to the priests and all these people, “This is what the LORD says: Do not listen to the prophets who say, ‘Very soon now the articles from the LORD’s house will be brought back from Babylon.’ They are prophesying lies to you."
Jeremiah,27,17,"Do not listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon, and you will live. Why should this city become a ruin?"
Jeremiah,27,18,"If they are prophets and have the word of the LORD, let them plead with the LORD Almighty that the articles remaining in the house of the LORD and in the palace of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem not be taken to Babylon."
Jeremiah,27,19,"For this is what the LORD Almighty says about the pillars, the bronze Sea, the movable stands and the other articles that are left in this city,"
Jeremiah,27,20,"which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take away when he carried Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem—"
Jeremiah,27,21,"yes, this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says about the things that are left in the house of the LORD and in the palace of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem:"
Jeremiah,27,22,"‘They will be taken to Babylon and there they will remain until the day I come for them,’ declares the LORD. ‘Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.’”"
Jeremiah,28,1,"In the fifth month of that same year, the fourth year, early in the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, who was from Gibeon, said to me in the house of the LORD in the presence of the priests and all the people:"
Jeremiah,28,2,"“This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,28,3,Within two years I will bring back to this place all the articles of the LORD’s house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon removed from here and took to Babylon.
Jeremiah,28,4,"I will also bring back to this place Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and all the other exiles from Judah who went to Babylon,’ declares the LORD, ‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’”"
Jeremiah,28,5,Then the prophet Jeremiah replied to the prophet Hananiah before the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the LORD.
Jeremiah,28,6,"He said, “Amen! May the LORD do so! May the LORD fulfill the words you have prophesied by bringing the articles of the LORD’s house and all the exiles back to this place from Babylon."
Jeremiah,28,7,"Nevertheless, listen to what I have to say in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people:"
Jeremiah,28,8,"From early times the prophets who preceded you and me have prophesied war, disaster and plague against many countries and great kingdoms."
Jeremiah,28,9,But the prophet who prophesies peace will be recognized as one truly sent by the LORD only if his prediction comes true.”
Jeremiah,28,10,"Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah and broke it,"
Jeremiah,28,11,"and he said before all the people, “This is what the LORD says: ‘In the same way I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon off the neck of all the nations within two years.’” At this, the prophet Jeremiah went on his way."
Jeremiah,28,12,"After the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:"
Jeremiah,28,13,"“Go and tell Hananiah, ‘This is what the LORD says: You have broken a wooden yoke, but in its place you will get a yoke of iron."
Jeremiah,28,14,"This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I will put an iron yoke on the necks of all these nations to make them serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they will serve him. I will even give him control over the wild animals.’”"
Jeremiah,28,15,"Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, “Listen, Hananiah! The LORD has not sent you, yet you have persuaded this nation to trust in lies."
Jeremiah,28,16,"Therefore this is what the LORD says: ‘I am about to remove you from the face of the earth. This very year you are going to die, because you have preached rebellion against the LORD.’”"
Jeremiah,28,17,"In the seventh month of that same year, Hananiah the prophet died."
Jeremiah,29,1,"This is the text of the letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to the surviving elders among the exiles and to the priests, the prophets and all the other people Nebuchadnezzar had carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon."
Jeremiah,29,2,"(This was after King Jehoiachin and the queen mother, the court officials and the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the skilled workers and the artisans had gone into exile from Jerusalem.)"
Jeremiah,29,3,"He entrusted the letter to Elasah son of Shaphan and to Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to King Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon. It said:"
Jeremiah,29,4,"This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says to all those I carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon:"
Jeremiah,29,5,“Build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce.
Jeremiah,29,6,"Marry and have sons and daughters; find wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage, so that they too may have sons and daughters. Increase in number there; do not decrease."
Jeremiah,29,7,"Also, seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which I have carried you into exile. Pray to the LORD for it, because if it prospers, you too will prosper.”"
Jeremiah,29,8,"Yes, this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: “Do not let the prophets and diviners among you deceive you. Do not listen to the dreams you encourage them to have."
Jeremiah,29,9,"They are prophesying lies to you in my name. I have not sent them,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,29,10,"This is what the LORD says: “When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will come to you and fulfill my good promise to bring you back to this place."
Jeremiah,29,11,"For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."
Jeremiah,29,12,"Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you."
Jeremiah,29,13,You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.
Jeremiah,29,14,"I will be found by you,” declares the LORD, “and will bring you back from captivity. I will gather you from all the nations and places where I have banished you,” declares the LORD, “and will bring you back to the place from which I carried you into exile.”"
Jeremiah,29,15,"You may say, “The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,”"
Jeremiah,29,16,"but this is what the LORD says about the king who sits on David’s throne and all the people who remain in this city, your fellow citizens who did not go with you into exile—"
Jeremiah,29,17,"yes, this is what the LORD Almighty says: “I will send the sword, famine and plague against them and I will make them like figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten."
Jeremiah,29,18,"I will pursue them with the sword, famine and plague and will make them abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth, a curse and an object of horror, of scorn and reproach, among all the nations where I drive them."
Jeremiah,29,19,"For they have not listened to my words,” declares the LORD, “words that I sent to them again and again by my servants the prophets. And you exiles have not listened either,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,29,20,"Therefore, hear the word of the LORD, all you exiles whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon."
Jeremiah,29,21,"This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says about Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying lies to you in my name: “I will deliver them into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will put them to death before your very eyes."
Jeremiah,29,22,"Because of them, all the exiles from Judah who are in Babylon will use this curse: ‘May the LORD treat you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon burned in the fire.’"
Jeremiah,29,23,"For they have done outrageous things in Israel; they have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and in my name they have uttered lies—which I did not authorize. I know it and am a witness to it,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,29,24,"Tell Shemaiah the Nehelamite,"
Jeremiah,29,25,"“This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You sent letters in your own name to all the people in Jerusalem, to the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, and to all the other priests. You said to Zephaniah,"
Jeremiah,29,26,‘The LORD has appointed you priest in place of Jehoiada to be in charge of the house of the LORD; you should put any maniac who acts like a prophet into the stocks and neck-irons.
Jeremiah,29,27,"So why have you not reprimanded Jeremiah from Anathoth, who poses as a prophet among you?"
Jeremiah,29,28,He has sent this message to us in Babylon: It will be a long time. Therefore build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce.’”
Jeremiah,29,29,"Zephaniah the priest, however, read the letter to Jeremiah the prophet."
Jeremiah,29,30,Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah,29,31,"“Send this message to all the exiles: ‘This is what the LORD says about Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, even though I did not send him, and has persuaded you to trust in lies,"
Jeremiah,29,32,"this is what the LORD says: I will surely punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants. He will have no one left among this people, nor will he see the good things I will do for my people, declares the LORD, because he has preached rebellion against me.’”"
Jeremiah,30,1,This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
Jeremiah,30,2,"“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Write in a book all the words I have spoken to you."
Jeremiah,30,3,"The days are coming,’ declares the LORD, ‘when I will bring my people Israel and Judah back from captivity and restore them to the land I gave their ancestors to possess,’ says the LORD.”"
Jeremiah,30,4,These are the words the LORD spoke concerning Israel and Judah:
Jeremiah,30,5,"“This is what the LORD says: “‘Cries of fear are heard— terror, not peace."
Jeremiah,30,6,"Ask and see: Can a man bear children? Then why do I see every strong man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor, every face turned deathly pale?"
Jeremiah,30,7,"How awful that day will be! No other will be like it. It will be a time of trouble for Jacob, but he will be saved out of it."
Jeremiah,30,8,"“‘In that day,’ declares the LORD Almighty, ‘I will break the yoke off their necks and will tear off their bonds; no longer will foreigners enslave them."
Jeremiah,30,9,"Instead, they will serve the LORD their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them."
Jeremiah,30,10,"“‘So do not be afraid, Jacob my servant; do not be dismayed, Israel,’ declares the LORD. ‘I will surely save you out of a distant place, your descendants from the land of their exile. Jacob will again have peace and security, and no one will make him afraid."
Jeremiah,30,11,"I am with you and will save you,’ declares the LORD. ‘Though I completely destroy all the nations among which I scatter you, I will not completely destroy you. I will discipline you but only in due measure; I will not let you go entirely unpunished.’"
Jeremiah,30,12,"“This is what the LORD says: “‘Your wound is incurable, your injury beyond healing."
Jeremiah,30,13,"There is no one to plead your cause, no remedy for your sore, no healing for you."
Jeremiah,30,14,"All your allies have forgotten you; they care nothing for you. I have struck you as an enemy would and punished you as would the cruel, because your guilt is so great and your sins so many."
Jeremiah,30,15,"Why do you cry out over your wound, your pain that has no cure? Because of your great guilt and many sins I have done these things to you."
Jeremiah,30,16,“‘But all who devour you will be devoured; all your enemies will go into exile. Those who plunder you will be plundered; all who make spoil of you I will despoil.
Jeremiah,30,17,"But I will restore you to health and heal your wounds,’ declares the LORD, ‘because you are called an outcast, Zion for whom no one cares.’"
Jeremiah,30,18,"“This is what the LORD says: “‘I will restore the fortunes of Jacob’s tents and have compassion on his dwellings; the city will be rebuilt on her ruins, and the palace will stand in its proper place."
Jeremiah,30,19,"From them will come songs of thanksgiving and the sound of rejoicing. I will add to their numbers, and they will not be decreased; I will bring them honor, and they will not be disdained."
Jeremiah,30,20,"Their children will be as in days of old, and their community will be established before me; I will punish all who oppress them."
Jeremiah,30,21,Their leader will be one of their own; their ruler will arise from among them. I will bring him near and he will come close to me— for who is he who will devote himself to be close to me?’ declares the LORD.
Jeremiah,30,22,"“‘So you will be my people, and I will be your God.’”"
Jeremiah,30,23,"See, the storm of the LORD will burst out in wrath, a driving wind swirling down on the heads of the wicked."
Jeremiah,30,24,The fierce anger of the LORD will not turn back until he fully accomplishes the purposes of his heart. In days to come you will understand this.
Jeremiah,31,1,"“At that time,” declares the LORD, “I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they will be my people.”"
Jeremiah,31,2,This is what the LORD says: “The people who survive the sword will find favor in the wilderness; I will come to give rest to Israel.”
Jeremiah,31,3,"The LORD appeared to us in the past, saying: “I have loved you with an everlasting love; I have drawn you with unfailing kindness."
Jeremiah,31,4,"I will build you up again, and you, Virgin Israel, will be rebuilt. Again you will take up your timbrels and go out to dance with the joyful."
Jeremiah,31,5,Again you will plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria; the farmers will plant them and enjoy their fruit.
Jeremiah,31,6,"There will be a day when watchmen cry out on the hills of Ephraim, ‘Come, let us go up to Zion, to the LORD our God.’”"
Jeremiah,31,7,"This is what the LORD says: “Sing with joy for Jacob; shout for the foremost of the nations. Make your praises heard, and say, ‘LORD, save your people, the remnant of Israel.’"
Jeremiah,31,8,"See, I will bring them from the land of the north and gather them from the ends of the earth. Among them will be the blind and the lame, expectant mothers and women in labor; a great throng will return."
Jeremiah,31,9,"They will come with weeping; they will pray as I bring them back. I will lead them beside streams of water on a level path where they will not stumble, because I am Israel’s father, and Ephraim is my firstborn son."
Jeremiah,31,10,"“Hear the word of the LORD, you nations; proclaim it in distant coastlands: ‘He who scattered Israel will gather them and will watch over his flock like a shepherd.’"
Jeremiah,31,11,For the LORD will deliver Jacob and redeem them from the hand of those stronger than they.
Jeremiah,31,12,"They will come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion; they will rejoice in the bounty of the LORD— the grain, the new wine and the olive oil, the young of the flocks and herds. They will be like a well-watered garden, and they will sorrow no more."
Jeremiah,31,13,"Then young women will dance and be glad, young men and old as well. I will turn their mourning into gladness; I will give them comfort and joy instead of sorrow."
Jeremiah,31,14,"I will satisfy the priests with abundance, and my people will be filled with my bounty,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,31,15,"This is what the LORD says: “A voice is heard in Ramah, mourning and great weeping, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.”"
Jeremiah,31,16,"This is what the LORD says: “Restrain your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears, for your work will be rewarded,” declares the LORD. “They will return from the land of the enemy."
Jeremiah,31,17,"So there is hope for your descendants,” declares the LORD. “Your children will return to their own land."
Jeremiah,31,18,"“I have surely heard Ephraim’s moaning: ‘You disciplined me like an unruly calf, and I have been disciplined. Restore me, and I will return, because you are the LORD my God."
Jeremiah,31,19,"After I strayed, I repented; after I came to understand, I beat my breast. I was ashamed and humiliated because I bore the disgrace of my youth.’"
Jeremiah,31,20,"Is not Ephraim my dear son, the child in whom I delight? Though I often speak against him, I still remember him. Therefore my heart yearns for him; I have great compassion for him,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,31,21,"“Set up road signs; put up guideposts. Take note of the highway, the road that you take. Return, Virgin Israel, return to your towns."
Jeremiah,31,22,"How long will you wander, unfaithful Daughter Israel? The LORD will create a new thing on earth— the woman will return to the man.”"
Jeremiah,31,23,"This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: “When I bring them back from captivity, the people in the land of Judah and in its towns will once again use these words: ‘The LORD bless you, you prosperous city, you sacred mountain.’"
Jeremiah,31,24,People will live together in Judah and all its towns—farmers and those who move about with their flocks.
Jeremiah,31,25,I will refresh the weary and satisfy the faint.”
Jeremiah,31,26,At this I awoke and looked around. My sleep had been pleasant to me.
Jeremiah,31,27,"“The days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when I will plant the kingdoms of Israel and Judah with the offspring of people and of animals."
Jeremiah,31,28,"Just as I watched over them to uproot and tear down, and to overthrow, destroy and bring disaster, so I will watch over them to build and to plant,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,31,29,"“In those days people will no longer say, ‘The parents have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.’"
Jeremiah,31,30,"Instead, everyone will die for their own sin; whoever eats sour grapes—their own teeth will be set on edge."
Jeremiah,31,31,"“The days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah."
Jeremiah,31,32,"It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they broke my covenant, though I was a husband to them,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,31,33,"“This is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel after that time,” declares the LORD. “I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people."
Jeremiah,31,34,"No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, ‘Know the LORD,’ because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest,” declares the LORD. “For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.”"
Jeremiah,31,35,"This is what the LORD says, he who appoints the sun to shine by day, who decrees the moon and stars to shine by night, who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar— the LORD Almighty is his name:"
Jeremiah,31,36,"“Only if these decrees vanish from my sight,” declares the LORD, “will Israel ever cease being a nation before me.”"
Jeremiah,31,37,"This is what the LORD says: “Only if the heavens above can be measured and the foundations of the earth below be searched out will I reject all the descendants of Israel because of all they have done,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,31,38,"“The days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when this city will be rebuilt for me from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate."
Jeremiah,31,39,The measuring line will stretch from there straight to the hill of Gareb and then turn to Goah.
Jeremiah,31,40,"The whole valley where dead bodies and ashes are thrown, and all the terraces out to the Kidron Valley on the east as far as the corner of the Horse Gate, will be holy to the LORD. The city will never again be uprooted or demolished.”"
Jeremiah,32,1,"This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar."
Jeremiah,32,2,"The army of the king of Babylon was then besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace of Judah."
Jeremiah,32,3,"Now Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him there, saying, “Why do you prophesy as you do? You say, ‘This is what the LORD says: I am about to give this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it."
Jeremiah,32,4,"Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape the Babylonians but will certainly be given into the hands of the king of Babylon, and will speak with him face to face and see him with his own eyes."
Jeremiah,32,5,"He will take Zedekiah to Babylon, where he will remain until I deal with him, declares the LORD. If you fight against the Babylonians, you will not succeed.’”"
Jeremiah,32,6,"Jeremiah said, “The word of the LORD came to me:"
Jeremiah,32,7,"Hanamel son of Shallum your uncle is going to come to you and say, ‘Buy my field at Anathoth, because as nearest relative it is your right and duty to buy it.’"
Jeremiah,32,8,"“Then, just as the LORD had said, my cousin Hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guard and said, ‘Buy my field at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin. Since it is your right to redeem it and possess it, buy it for yourself.’ “I knew that this was the word of the LORD;"
Jeremiah,32,9,so I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel and weighed out for him seventeen shekels of silver.
Jeremiah,32,10,"I signed and sealed the deed, had it witnessed, and weighed out the silver on the scales."
Jeremiah,32,11,"I took the deed of purchase—the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions, as well as the unsealed copy—"
Jeremiah,32,12,"and I gave this deed to Baruch son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel and of the witnesses who had signed the deed and of all the Jews sitting in the courtyard of the guard."
Jeremiah,32,13,“In their presence I gave Baruch these instructions:
Jeremiah,32,14,"‘This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Take these documents, both the sealed and unsealed copies of the deed of purchase, and put them in a clay jar so they will last a long time."
Jeremiah,32,15,"For this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Houses, fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land.’"
Jeremiah,32,16,"“After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD:"
Jeremiah,32,17,"“Ah, Sovereign LORD, you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and outstretched arm. Nothing is too hard for you."
Jeremiah,32,18,"You show love to thousands but bring the punishment for the parents’ sins into the laps of their children after them. Great and mighty God, whose name is the LORD Almighty,"
Jeremiah,32,19,great are your purposes and mighty are your deeds. Your eyes are open to the ways of all mankind; you reward each person according to their conduct and as their deeds deserve.
Jeremiah,32,20,"You performed signs and wonders in Egypt and have continued them to this day, in Israel and among all mankind, and have gained the renown that is still yours."
Jeremiah,32,21,"You brought your people Israel out of Egypt with signs and wonders, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with great terror."
Jeremiah,32,22,"You gave them this land you had sworn to give their ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey."
Jeremiah,32,23,"They came in and took possession of it, but they did not obey you or follow your law; they did not do what you commanded them to do. So you brought all this disaster on them."
Jeremiah,32,24,"“See how the siege ramps are built up to take the city. Because of the sword, famine and plague, the city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians who are attacking it. What you said has happened, as you now see."
Jeremiah,32,25,"And though the city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians, you, Sovereign LORD, say to me, ‘Buy the field with silver and have the transaction witnessed.’”"
Jeremiah,32,26,Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah,32,27,"“I am the LORD, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me?"
Jeremiah,32,28,"Therefore this is what the LORD says: I am about to give this city into the hands of the Babylonians and to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who will capture it."
Jeremiah,32,29,"The Babylonians who are attacking this city will come in and set it on fire; they will burn it down, along with the houses where the people aroused my anger by burning incense on the roofs to Baal and by pouring out drink offerings to other gods."
Jeremiah,32,30,"“The people of Israel and Judah have done nothing but evil in my sight from their youth; indeed, the people of Israel have done nothing but arouse my anger with what their hands have made, declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,32,31,"From the day it was built until now, this city has so aroused my anger and wrath that I must remove it from my sight."
Jeremiah,32,32,"The people of Israel and Judah have provoked me by all the evil they have done—they, their kings and officials, their priests and prophets, the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,32,33,"They turned their backs to me and not their faces; though I taught them again and again, they would not listen or respond to discipline."
Jeremiah,32,34,They set up their vile images in the house that bears my Name and defiled it.
Jeremiah,32,35,"They built high places for Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molek, though I never commanded—nor did it enter my mind—that they should do such a detestable thing and so make Judah sin."
Jeremiah,32,36,"“You are saying about this city, ‘By the sword, famine and plague it will be given into the hands of the king of Babylon’; but this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:"
Jeremiah,32,37,I will surely gather them from all the lands where I banish them in my furious anger and great wrath; I will bring them back to this place and let them live in safety.
Jeremiah,32,38,"They will be my people, and I will be their God."
Jeremiah,32,39,"I will give them singleness of heart and action, so that they will always fear me and that all will then go well for them and for their children after them."
Jeremiah,32,40,"I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will never stop doing good to them, and I will inspire them to fear me, so that they will never turn away from me."
Jeremiah,32,41,I will rejoice in doing them good and will assuredly plant them in this land with all my heart and soul.
Jeremiah,32,42,"“This is what the LORD says: As I have brought all this great calamity on this people, so I will give them all the prosperity I have promised them."
Jeremiah,32,43,"Once more fields will be bought in this land of which you say, ‘It is a desolate waste, without people or animals, for it has been given into the hands of the Babylonians.’"
Jeremiah,32,44,"Fields will be bought for silver, and deeds will be signed, sealed and witnessed in the territory of Benjamin, in the villages around Jerusalem, in the towns of Judah and in the towns of the hill country, of the western foothills and of the Negev, because I will restore their fortunes, declares the LORD.”"
Jeremiah,33,1,"While Jeremiah was still confined in the courtyard of the guard, the word of the LORD came to him a second time:"
Jeremiah,33,2,"“This is what the LORD says, he who made the earth, the LORD who formed it and established it—the LORD is his name:"
Jeremiah,33,3,‘Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know.’
Jeremiah,33,4,"For this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says about the houses in this city and the royal palaces of Judah that have been torn down to be used against the siege ramps and the sword"
Jeremiah,33,5,in the fight with the Babylonians: ‘They will be filled with the dead bodies of the people I will slay in my anger and wrath. I will hide my face from this city because of all its wickedness.
Jeremiah,33,6,"“‘Nevertheless, I will bring health and healing to it; I will heal my people and will let them enjoy abundant peace and security."
Jeremiah,33,7,I will bring Judah and Israel back from captivity and will rebuild them as they were before.
Jeremiah,33,8,I will cleanse them from all the sin they have committed against me and will forgive all their sins of rebellion against me.
Jeremiah,33,9,"Then this city will bring me renown, joy, praise and honor before all nations on earth that hear of all the good things I do for it; and they will be in awe and will tremble at the abundant prosperity and peace I provide for it.’"
Jeremiah,33,10,"“This is what the LORD says: ‘You say about this place, “It is a desolate waste, without people or animals.” Yet in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are deserted, inhabited by neither people nor animals, there will be heard once more"
Jeremiah,33,11,"the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of bride and bridegroom, and the voices of those who bring thank offerings to the house of the LORD, saying, “Give thanks to the LORD Almighty, for the LORD is good; his love endures forever.” For I will restore the fortunes of the land as they were before,’ says the LORD."
Jeremiah,33,12,"“This is what the LORD Almighty says: ‘In this place, desolate and without people or animals—in all its towns there will again be pastures for shepherds to rest their flocks."
Jeremiah,33,13,"In the towns of the hill country, of the western foothills and of the Negev, in the territory of Benjamin, in the villages around Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah, flocks will again pass under the hand of the one who counts them,’ says the LORD."
Jeremiah,33,14,"“‘The days are coming,’ declares the LORD, ‘when I will fulfill the good promise I made to the people of Israel and Judah."
Jeremiah,33,15,“‘In those days and at that time I will make a righteous Branch sprout from David’s line; he will do what is just and right in the land.
Jeremiah,33,16,In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety. This is the name by which it will be called: The LORD Our Righteous Savior.’
Jeremiah,33,17,"For this is what the LORD says: ‘David will never fail to have a man to sit on the throne of Israel,"
Jeremiah,33,18,"nor will the Levitical priests ever fail to have a man to stand before me continually to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings and to present sacrifices.’”"
Jeremiah,33,19,The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah,33,20,"“This is what the LORD says: ‘If you can break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night, so that day and night no longer come at their appointed time,"
Jeremiah,33,21,then my covenant with David my servant—and my covenant with the Levites who are priests ministering before me—can be broken and David will no longer have a descendant to reign on his throne.
Jeremiah,33,22,I will make the descendants of David my servant and the Levites who minister before me as countless as the stars in the sky and as measureless as the sand on the seashore.’”
Jeremiah,33,23,The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah,33,24,"“Have you not noticed that these people are saying, ‘The LORD has rejected the two kingdoms he chose’? So they despise my people and no longer regard them as a nation."
Jeremiah,33,25,"This is what the LORD says: ‘If I have not made my covenant with day and night and established the laws of heaven and earth,"
Jeremiah,33,26,"then I will reject the descendants of Jacob and David my servant and will not choose one of his sons to rule over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. For I will restore their fortunes and have compassion on them.’”"
Jeremiah,34,1,"While Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms and peoples in the empire he ruled were fighting against Jerusalem and all its surrounding towns, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD:"
Jeremiah,34,2,"“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Go to Zedekiah king of Judah and tell him, ‘This is what the LORD says: I am about to give this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down."
Jeremiah,34,3,"You will not escape from his grasp but will surely be captured and given into his hands. You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes, and he will speak with you face to face. And you will go to Babylon."
Jeremiah,34,4,"“‘Yet hear the LORD’s promise to you, Zedekiah king of Judah. This is what the LORD says concerning you: You will not die by the sword;"
Jeremiah,34,5,"you will die peacefully. As people made a funeral fire in honor of your predecessors, the kings who ruled before you, so they will make a fire in your honor and lament, “Alas, master!” I myself make this promise, declares the LORD.’”"
Jeremiah,34,6,"Then Jeremiah the prophet told all this to Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem,"
Jeremiah,34,7,while the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and the other cities of Judah that were still holding out—Lachish and Azekah. These were the only fortified cities left in Judah.
Jeremiah,34,8,The word came to Jeremiah from the LORD after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim freedom for the slaves.
Jeremiah,34,9,"Everyone was to free their Hebrew slaves, both male and female; no one was to hold a fellow Hebrew in bondage."
Jeremiah,34,10,"So all the officials and people who entered into this covenant agreed that they would free their male and female slaves and no longer hold them in bondage. They agreed, and set them free."
Jeremiah,34,11,But afterward they changed their minds and took back the slaves they had freed and enslaved them again.
Jeremiah,34,12,Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah,34,13,"“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. I said,"
Jeremiah,34,14,"‘Every seventh year each of you must free any fellow Hebrews who have sold themselves to you. After they have served you six years, you must let them go free.’ Your ancestors, however, did not listen to me or pay attention to me."
Jeremiah,34,15,Recently you repented and did what is right in my sight: Each of you proclaimed freedom to your own people. You even made a covenant before me in the house that bears my Name.
Jeremiah,34,16,But now you have turned around and profaned my name; each of you has taken back the male and female slaves you had set free to go where they wished. You have forced them to become your slaves again.
Jeremiah,34,17,"“Therefore this is what the LORD says: You have not obeyed me; you have not proclaimed freedom to your own people. So I now proclaim ‘freedom’ for you, declares the LORD—‘freedom’ to fall by the sword, plague and famine. I will make you abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth."
Jeremiah,34,18,"Those who have violated my covenant and have not fulfilled the terms of the covenant they made before me, I will treat like the calf they cut in two and then walked between its pieces."
Jeremiah,34,19,"The leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the court officials, the priests and all the people of the land who walked between the pieces of the calf,"
Jeremiah,34,20,I will deliver into the hands of their enemies who want to kill them. Their dead bodies will become food for the birds and the wild animals.
Jeremiah,34,21,"“I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials into the hands of their enemies who want to kill them, to the army of the king of Babylon, which has withdrawn from you."
Jeremiah,34,22,"I am going to give the order, declares the LORD, and I will bring them back to this city. They will fight against it, take it and burn it down. And I will lay waste the towns of Judah so no one can live there.”"
Jeremiah,35,1,This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD during the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah:
Jeremiah,35,2,“Go to the Rekabite family and invite them to come to one of the side rooms of the house of the LORD and give them wine to drink.”
Jeremiah,35,3,"So I went to get Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons—the whole family of the Rekabites."
Jeremiah,35,4,"I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the room of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah the man of God. It was next to the room of the officials, which was over that of Maaseiah son of Shallum the doorkeeper."
Jeremiah,35,5,"Then I set bowls full of wine and some cups before the Rekabites and said to them, “Drink some wine.”"
Jeremiah,35,6,"But they replied, “We do not drink wine, because our forefather Jehonadab son of Rekab gave us this command: ‘Neither you nor your descendants must ever drink wine."
Jeremiah,35,7,"Also you must never build houses, sow seed or plant vineyards; you must never have any of these things, but must always live in tents. Then you will live a long time in the land where you are nomads.’"
Jeremiah,35,8,We have obeyed everything our forefather Jehonadab son of Rekab commanded us. Neither we nor our wives nor our sons and daughters have ever drunk wine
Jeremiah,35,9,"or built houses to live in or had vineyards, fields or crops."
Jeremiah,35,10,We have lived in tents and have fully obeyed everything our forefather Jehonadab commanded us.
Jeremiah,35,11,"But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded this land, we said, ‘Come, we must go to Jerusalem to escape the Babylonian and Aramean armies.’ So we have remained in Jerusalem.”"
Jeremiah,35,12,"Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying:"
Jeremiah,35,13,"“This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Go and tell the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, ‘Will you not learn a lesson and obey my words?’ declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,35,14,"‘Jehonadab son of Rekab ordered his descendants not to drink wine and this command has been kept. To this day they do not drink wine, because they obey their forefather’s command. But I have spoken to you again and again, yet you have not obeyed me."
Jeremiah,35,15,"Again and again I sent all my servants the prophets to you. They said, “Each of you must turn from your wicked ways and reform your actions; do not follow other gods to serve them. Then you will live in the land I have given to you and your ancestors.” But you have not paid attention or listened to me."
Jeremiah,35,16,"The descendants of Jehonadab son of Rekab have carried out the command their forefather gave them, but these people have not obeyed me.’"
Jeremiah,35,17,"“Therefore this is what the LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘Listen! I am going to bring on Judah and on everyone living in Jerusalem every disaster I pronounced against them. I spoke to them, but they did not listen; I called to them, but they did not answer.’”"
Jeremiah,35,18,"Then Jeremiah said to the family of the Rekabites, “This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘You have obeyed the command of your forefather Jehonadab and have followed all his instructions and have done everything he ordered.’"
Jeremiah,35,19,"Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘Jehonadab son of Rekab will never fail to have a descendant to serve me.’”"
Jeremiah,36,1,"In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD:"
Jeremiah,36,2,"“Take a scroll and write on it all the words I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah and all the other nations from the time I began speaking to you in the reign of Josiah till now."
Jeremiah,36,3,"Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about every disaster I plan to inflict on them, they will each turn from their wicked ways; then I will forgive their wickedness and their sin.”"
Jeremiah,36,4,"So Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and while Jeremiah dictated all the words the LORD had spoken to him, Baruch wrote them on the scroll."
Jeremiah,36,5,"Then Jeremiah told Baruch, “I am restricted; I am not allowed to go to the LORD’s temple."
Jeremiah,36,6,So you go to the house of the LORD on a day of fasting and read to the people from the scroll the words of the LORD that you wrote as I dictated. Read them to all the people of Judah who come in from their towns.
Jeremiah,36,7,"Perhaps they will bring their petition before the LORD and will each turn from their wicked ways, for the anger and wrath pronounced against this people by the LORD are great.”"
Jeremiah,36,8,Baruch son of Neriah did everything Jeremiah the prophet told him to do; at the LORD’s temple he read the words of the LORD from the scroll.
Jeremiah,36,9,"In the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, a time of fasting before the LORD was proclaimed for all the people in Jerusalem and those who had come from the towns of Judah."
Jeremiah,36,10,"From the room of Gemariah son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate of the temple, Baruch read to all the people at the LORD’s temple the words of Jeremiah from the scroll."
Jeremiah,36,11,"When Micaiah son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the scroll,"
Jeremiah,36,12,"he went down to the secretary’s room in the royal palace, where all the officials were sitting: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Akbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials."
Jeremiah,36,13,"After Micaiah told them everything he had heard Baruch read to the people from the scroll,"
Jeremiah,36,14,"all the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, “Bring the scroll from which you have read to the people and come.” So Baruch son of Neriah went to them with the scroll in his hand."
Jeremiah,36,15,"They said to him, “Sit down, please, and read it to us.” So Baruch read it to them."
Jeremiah,36,16,"When they heard all these words, they looked at each other in fear and said to Baruch, “We must report all these words to the king.”"
Jeremiah,36,17,"Then they asked Baruch, “Tell us, how did you come to write all this? Did Jeremiah dictate it?”"
Jeremiah,36,18,"“Yes,” Baruch replied, “he dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them in ink on the scroll.”"
Jeremiah,36,19,"Then the officials said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah, go and hide. Don’t let anyone know where you are.”"
Jeremiah,36,20,"After they put the scroll in the room of Elishama the secretary, they went to the king in the courtyard and reported everything to him."
Jeremiah,36,21,"The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and Jehudi brought it from the room of Elishama the secretary and read it to the king and all the officials standing beside him."
Jeremiah,36,22,"It was the ninth month and the king was sitting in the winter apartment, with a fire burning in the firepot in front of him."
Jeremiah,36,23,"Whenever Jehudi had read three or four columns of the scroll, the king cut them off with a scribe’s knife and threw them into the firepot, until the entire scroll was burned in the fire."
Jeremiah,36,24,"The king and all his attendants who heard all these words showed no fear, nor did they tear their clothes."
Jeremiah,36,25,"Even though Elnathan, Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them."
Jeremiah,36,26,"Instead, the king commanded Jerahmeel, a son of the king, Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But the LORD had hidden them."
Jeremiah,36,27,"After the king burned the scroll containing the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah’s dictation, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:"
Jeremiah,36,28,"“Take another scroll and write on it all the words that were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah burned up."
Jeremiah,36,29,"Also tell Jehoiakim king of Judah, ‘This is what the LORD says: You burned that scroll and said, “Why did you write on it that the king of Babylon would certainly come and destroy this land and wipe from it both man and beast?”"
Jeremiah,36,30,Therefore this is what the LORD says about Jehoiakim king of Judah: He will have no one to sit on the throne of David; his body will be thrown out and exposed to the heat by day and the frost by night.
Jeremiah,36,31,"I will punish him and his children and his attendants for their wickedness; I will bring on them and those living in Jerusalem and the people of Judah every disaster I pronounced against them, because they have not listened.’”"
Jeremiah,36,32,"So Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah, and as Jeremiah dictated, Baruch wrote on it all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them."
Jeremiah,37,1,Zedekiah son of Josiah was made king of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; he reigned in place of Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim.
Jeremiah,37,2,Neither he nor his attendants nor the people of the land paid any attention to the words the LORD had spoken through Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah,37,3,"King Zedekiah, however, sent Jehukal son of Shelemiah with the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to Jeremiah the prophet with this message: “Please pray to the LORD our God for us.”"
Jeremiah,37,4,"Now Jeremiah was free to come and go among the people, for he had not yet been put in prison."
Jeremiah,37,5,"Pharaoh’s army had marched out of Egypt, and when the Babylonians who were besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them, they withdrew from Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,37,6,Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet:
Jeremiah,37,7,"“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of me, ‘Pharaoh’s army, which has marched out to support you, will go back to its own land, to Egypt."
Jeremiah,37,8,Then the Babylonians will return and attack this city; they will capture it and burn it down.’
Jeremiah,37,9,"“This is what the LORD says: Do not deceive yourselves, thinking, ‘The Babylonians will surely leave us.’ They will not!"
Jeremiah,37,10,"Even if you were to defeat the entire Babylonian army that is attacking you and only wounded men were left in their tents, they would come out and burn this city down.”"
Jeremiah,37,11,"After the Babylonian army had withdrawn from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s army,"
Jeremiah,37,12,Jeremiah started to leave the city to go to the territory of Benjamin to get his share of the property among the people there.
Jeremiah,37,13,"But when he reached the Benjamin Gate, the captain of the guard, whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah, arrested him and said, “You are deserting to the Babylonians!”"
Jeremiah,37,14,"“That’s not true!” Jeremiah said. “I am not deserting to the Babylonians.” But Irijah would not listen to him; instead, he arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials."
Jeremiah,37,15,"They were angry with Jeremiah and had him beaten and imprisoned in the house of Jonathan the secretary, which they had made into a prison."
Jeremiah,37,16,"Jeremiah was put into a vaulted cell in a dungeon, where he remained a long time."
Jeremiah,37,17,"Then King Zedekiah sent for him and had him brought to the palace, where he asked him privately, “Is there any word from the LORD?” “Yes,” Jeremiah replied, “you will be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon.”"
Jeremiah,37,18,"Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “What crime have I committed against you or your attendants or this people, that you have put me in prison?"
Jeremiah,37,19,"Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, ‘The king of Babylon will not attack you or this land’?"
Jeremiah,37,20,"But now, my lord the king, please listen. Let me bring my petition before you: Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, or I will die there.”"
Jeremiah,37,21,King Zedekiah then gave orders for Jeremiah to be placed in the courtyard of the guard and given a loaf of bread from the street of the bakers each day until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.
Jeremiah,38,1,"Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehukal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malkijah heard what Jeremiah was telling all the people when he said,"
Jeremiah,38,2,"“This is what the LORD says: ‘Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine or plague, but whoever goes over to the Babylonians will live. They will escape with their lives; they will live.’"
Jeremiah,38,3,"And this is what the LORD says: ‘This city will certainly be given into the hands of the army of the king of Babylon, who will capture it.’”"
Jeremiah,38,4,"Then the officials said to the king, “This man should be put to death. He is discouraging the soldiers who are left in this city, as well as all the people, by the things he is saying to them. This man is not seeking the good of these people but their ruin.”"
Jeremiah,38,5,"“He is in your hands,” King Zedekiah answered. “The king can do nothing to oppose you.”"
Jeremiah,38,6,"So they took Jeremiah and put him into the cistern of Malkijah, the king’s son, which was in the courtyard of the guard. They lowered Jeremiah by ropes into the cistern; it had no water in it, only mud, and Jeremiah sank down into the mud."
Jeremiah,38,7,"But Ebed-Melek, a Cushite, an official in the royal palace, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern. While the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate,"
Jeremiah,38,8,"Ebed-Melek went out of the palace and said to him,"
Jeremiah,38,9,"“My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all they have done to Jeremiah the prophet. They have thrown him into a cistern, where he will starve to death when there is no longer any bread in the city.”"
Jeremiah,38,10,"Then the king commanded Ebed-Melek the Cushite, “Take thirty men from here with you and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.”"
Jeremiah,38,11,So Ebed-Melek took the men with him and went to a room under the treasury in the palace. He took some old rags and worn-out clothes from there and let them down with ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern.
Jeremiah,38,12,"Ebed-Melek the Cushite said to Jeremiah, “Put these old rags and worn-out clothes under your arms to pad the ropes.” Jeremiah did so,"
Jeremiah,38,13,and they pulled him up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.
Jeremiah,38,14,"Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and had him brought to the third entrance to the temple of the LORD. “I am going to ask you something,” the king said to Jeremiah. “Do not hide anything from me.”"
Jeremiah,38,15,"Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I give you an answer, will you not kill me? Even if I did give you counsel, you would not listen to me.”"
Jeremiah,38,16,"But King Zedekiah swore this oath secretly to Jeremiah: “As surely as the LORD lives, who has given us breath, I will neither kill you nor hand you over to those who want to kill you.”"
Jeremiah,38,17,"Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “This is what the LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, your life will be spared and this city will not be burned down; you and your family will live."
Jeremiah,38,18,"But if you will not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, this city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians and they will burn it down; you yourself will not escape from them.’”"
Jeremiah,38,19,"King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have gone over to the Babylonians, for the Babylonians may hand me over to them and they will mistreat me.”"
Jeremiah,38,20,"“They will not hand you over,” Jeremiah replied. “Obey the LORD by doing what I tell you. Then it will go well with you, and your life will be spared."
Jeremiah,38,21,"But if you refuse to surrender, this is what the LORD has revealed to me:"
Jeremiah,38,22,All the women left in the palace of the king of Judah will be brought out to the officials of the king of Babylon. Those women will say to you: “‘They misled you and overcame you— those trusted friends of yours. Your feet are sunk in the mud; your friends have deserted you.’
Jeremiah,38,23,“All your wives and children will be brought out to the Babylonians. You yourself will not escape from their hands but will be captured by the king of Babylon; and this city will be burned down.”
Jeremiah,38,24,"Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Do not let anyone know about this conversation, or you may die."
Jeremiah,38,25,"If the officials hear that I talked with you, and they come to you and say, ‘Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; do not hide it from us or we will kill you,’"
Jeremiah,38,26,"then tell them, ‘I was pleading with the king not to send me back to Jonathan’s house to die there.’”"
Jeremiah,38,27,"All the officials did come to Jeremiah and question him, and he told them everything the king had ordered him to say. So they said no more to him, for no one had heard his conversation with the king."
Jeremiah,38,28,This is how Jerusalem was taken:
Jeremiah,39,1,"In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army and laid siege to it."
Jeremiah,39,2,"And on the ninth day of the fourth month of Zedekiah’s eleventh year, the city wall was broken through."
Jeremiah,39,3,"Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came and took seats in the Middle Gate: Nergal-Sharezer of Samgar, Nebo-Sarsekim a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer a high official and all the other officials of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,39,4,"When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled; they left the city at night by way of the king’s garden, through the gate between the two walls, and headed toward the Arabah."
Jeremiah,39,5,"But the Babylonian army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. They captured him and took him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced sentence on him."
Jeremiah,39,6,There at Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes and also killed all the nobles of Judah.
Jeremiah,39,7,Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him with bronze shackles to take him to Babylon.
Jeremiah,39,8,The Babylonians set fire to the royal palace and the houses of the people and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,39,9,"Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard carried into exile to Babylon the people who remained in the city, along with those who had gone over to him, and the rest of the people."
Jeremiah,39,10,"But Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard left behind in the land of Judah some of the poor people, who owned nothing; and at that time he gave them vineyards and fields."
Jeremiah,39,11,Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had given these orders about Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard:
Jeremiah,39,12,“Take him and look after him; don’t harm him but do for him whatever he asks.”
Jeremiah,39,13,"So Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard, Nebushazban a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer a high official and all the other officers of the king of Babylon"
Jeremiah,39,14,"sent and had Jeremiah taken out of the courtyard of the guard. They turned him over to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him back to his home. So he remained among his own people."
Jeremiah,39,15,"While Jeremiah had been confined in the courtyard of the guard, the word of the LORD came to him:"
Jeremiah,39,16,"“Go and tell Ebed-Melek the Cushite, ‘This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I am about to fulfill my words against this city—words concerning disaster, not prosperity. At that time they will be fulfilled before your eyes."
Jeremiah,39,17,"But I will rescue you on that day, declares the LORD; you will not be given into the hands of those you fear."
Jeremiah,39,18,"I will save you; you will not fall by the sword but will escape with your life, because you trust in me, declares the LORD.’”"
Jeremiah,40,1,The word came to Jeremiah from the LORD after Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had released him at Ramah. He had found Jeremiah bound in chains among all the captives from Jerusalem and Judah who were being carried into exile to Babylon.
Jeremiah,40,2,"When the commander of the guard found Jeremiah, he said to him, “The LORD your God decreed this disaster for this place."
Jeremiah,40,3,And now the LORD has brought it about; he has done just as he said he would. All this happened because you people sinned against the LORD and did not obey him.
Jeremiah,40,4,"But today I am freeing you from the chains on your wrists. Come with me to Babylon, if you like, and I will look after you; but if you do not want to, then don’t come. Look, the whole country lies before you; go wherever you please.”"
Jeremiah,40,5,"However, before Jeremiah turned to go, Nebuzaradan added, “Go back to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the towns of Judah, and live with him among the people, or go anywhere else you please.” Then the commander gave him provisions and a present and let him go."
Jeremiah,40,6,So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah and stayed with him among the people who were left behind in the land.
Jeremiah,40,7,"When all the army officers and their men who were still in the open country heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam as governor over the land and had put him in charge of the men, women and children who were the poorest in the land and who had not been carried into exile to Babylon,"
Jeremiah,40,8,"they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maakathite, and their men."
Jeremiah,40,9,"Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, took an oath to reassure them and their men. “Do not be afraid to serve the Babylonians,” he said. “Settle down in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you."
Jeremiah,40,10,"I myself will stay at Mizpah to represent you before the Babylonians who come to us, but you are to harvest the wine, summer fruit and olive oil, and put them in your storage jars, and live in the towns you have taken over.”"
Jeremiah,40,11,"When all the Jews in Moab, Ammon, Edom and all the other countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, as governor over them,"
Jeremiah,40,12,"they all came back to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, from all the countries where they had been scattered. And they harvested an abundance of wine and summer fruit."
Jeremiah,40,13,Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers still in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
Jeremiah,40,14,"and said to him, “Don’t you know that Baalis king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah son of Ahikam did not believe them."
Jeremiah,40,15,"Then Johanan son of Kareah said privately to Gedaliah in Mizpah, “Let me go and kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he take your life and cause all the Jews who are gathered around you to be scattered and the remnant of Judah to perish?”"
Jeremiah,40,16,"But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah, “Don’t do such a thing! What you are saying about Ishmael is not true.”"
Jeremiah,41,1,"In the seventh month Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who was of royal blood and had been one of the king’s officers, came with ten men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah. While they were eating together there,"
Jeremiah,41,2,"Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him got up and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword, killing the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land."
Jeremiah,41,3,"Ishmael also killed all the men of Judah who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, as well as the Babylonian soldiers who were there."
Jeremiah,41,4,"The day after Gedaliah’s assassination, before anyone knew about it,"
Jeremiah,41,5,"eighty men who had shaved off their beards, torn their clothes and cut themselves came from Shechem, Shiloh and Samaria, bringing grain offerings and incense with them to the house of the LORD."
Jeremiah,41,6,"Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went. When he met them, he said, “Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam.”"
Jeremiah,41,7,"When they went into the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men who were with him slaughtered them and threw them into a cistern."
Jeremiah,41,8,"But ten of them said to Ishmael, “Don’t kill us! We have wheat and barley, olive oil and honey, hidden in a field.” So he let them alone and did not kill them with the others."
Jeremiah,41,9,Now the cistern where he threw all the bodies of the men he had killed along with Gedaliah was the one King Asa had made as part of his defense against Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the dead.
Jeremiah,41,10,"Ishmael made captives of all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah—the king’s daughters along with all the others who were left there, over whom Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites."
Jeremiah,41,11,"When Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him heard about all the crimes Ishmael son of Nethaniah had committed,"
Jeremiah,41,12,they took all their men and went to fight Ishmael son of Nethaniah. They caught up with him near the great pool in Gibeon.
Jeremiah,41,13,"When all the people Ishmael had with him saw Johanan son of Kareah and the army officers who were with him, they were glad."
Jeremiah,41,14,All the people Ishmael had taken captive at Mizpah turned and went over to Johanan son of Kareah.
Jeremiah,41,15,But Ishmael son of Nethaniah and eight of his men escaped from Johanan and fled to the Ammonites.
Jeremiah,41,16,"Then Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him led away all the people of Mizpah who had survived, whom Johanan had recovered from Ishmael son of Nethaniah after Ishmael had assassinated Gedaliah son of Ahikam—the soldiers, women, children and court officials he had recovered from Gibeon."
Jeremiah,41,17,"And they went on, stopping at Geruth Kimham near Bethlehem on their way to Egypt"
Jeremiah,41,18,"to escape the Babylonians. They were afraid of them because Ishmael son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land."
Jeremiah,42,1,"Then all the army officers, including Johanan son of Kareah and Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest approached"
Jeremiah,42,2,"Jeremiah the prophet and said to him, “Please hear our petition and pray to the LORD your God for this entire remnant. For as you now see, though we were once many, now only a few are left."
Jeremiah,42,3,Pray that the LORD your God will tell us where we should go and what we should do.”
Jeremiah,42,4,"“I have heard you,” replied Jeremiah the prophet. “I will certainly pray to the LORD your God as you have requested; I will tell you everything the LORD says and will keep nothing back from you.”"
Jeremiah,42,5,"Then they said to Jeremiah, “May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act in accordance with everything the LORD your God sends you to tell us."
Jeremiah,42,6,"Whether it is favorable or unfavorable, we will obey the LORD our God, to whom we are sending you, so that it will go well with us, for we will obey the LORD our God.”"
Jeremiah,42,7,Ten days later the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah.
Jeremiah,42,8,So he called together Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him and all the people from the least to the greatest.
Jeremiah,42,9,"He said to them, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your petition, says:"
Jeremiah,42,10,"‘If you stay in this land, I will build you up and not tear you down; I will plant you and not uproot you, for I have relented concerning the disaster I have inflicted on you."
Jeremiah,42,11,"Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you now fear. Do not be afraid of him, declares the LORD, for I am with you and will save you and deliver you from his hands."
Jeremiah,42,12,I will show you compassion so that he will have compassion on you and restore you to your land.’
Jeremiah,42,13,"“However, if you say, ‘We will not stay in this land,’ and so disobey the LORD your God,"
Jeremiah,42,14,"and if you say, ‘No, we will go and live in Egypt, where we will not see war or hear the trumpet or be hungry for bread,’"
Jeremiah,42,15,"then hear the word of the LORD, you remnant of Judah. This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you are determined to go to Egypt and you do go to settle there,"
Jeremiah,42,16,"then the sword you fear will overtake you there, and the famine you dread will follow you into Egypt, and there you will die."
Jeremiah,42,17,"Indeed, all who are determined to go to Egypt to settle there will die by the sword, famine and plague; not one of them will survive or escape the disaster I will bring on them.’"
Jeremiah,42,18,"This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘As my anger and wrath have been poured out on those who lived in Jerusalem, so will my wrath be poured out on you when you go to Egypt. You will be a curse and an object of horror, a curse and an object of reproach; you will never see this place again.’"
Jeremiah,42,19,"“Remnant of Judah, the LORD has told you, ‘Do not go to Egypt.’ Be sure of this: I warn you today"
Jeremiah,42,20,"that you made a fatal mistake when you sent me to the LORD your God and said, ‘Pray to the LORD our God for us; tell us everything he says and we will do it.’"
Jeremiah,42,21,"I have told you today, but you still have not obeyed the LORD your God in all he sent me to tell you."
Jeremiah,42,22,"So now, be sure of this: You will die by the sword, famine and plague in the place where you want to go to settle.”"
Jeremiah,43,1,When Jeremiah had finished telling the people all the words of the LORD their God—everything the LORD had sent him to tell them—
Jeremiah,43,2,"Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the arrogant men said to Jeremiah, “You are lying! The LORD our God has not sent you to say, ‘You must not go to Egypt to settle there.’"
Jeremiah,43,3,"But Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us to hand us over to the Babylonians, so they may kill us or carry us into exile to Babylon.”"
Jeremiah,43,4,So Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers and all the people disobeyed the LORD’s command to stay in the land of Judah.
Jeremiah,43,5,"Instead, Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers led away all the remnant of Judah who had come back to live in the land of Judah from all the nations where they had been scattered."
Jeremiah,43,6,"They also led away all those whom Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan—the men, the women, the children and the king’s daughters. And they took Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah along with them."
Jeremiah,43,7,So they entered Egypt in disobedience to the LORD and went as far as Tahpanhes.
Jeremiah,43,8,In Tahpanhes the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah,43,9,"“While the Jews are watching, take some large stones with you and bury them in clay in the brick pavement at the entrance to Pharaoh’s palace in Tahpanhes."
Jeremiah,43,10,"Then say to them, ‘This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I will send for my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and I will set his throne over these stones I have buried here; he will spread his royal canopy above them."
Jeremiah,43,11,"He will come and attack Egypt, bringing death to those destined for death, captivity to those destined for captivity, and the sword to those destined for the sword."
Jeremiah,43,12,"He will set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt; he will burn their temples and take their gods captive. As a shepherd picks his garment clean of lice, so he will pick Egypt clean and depart."
Jeremiah,43,13,There in the temple of the sun in Egypt he will demolish the sacred pillars and will burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt.’”
Jeremiah,44,1,"This word came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews living in Lower Egypt—in Migdol, Tahpanhes and Memphis—and in Upper Egypt:"
Jeremiah,44,2,"“This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You saw the great disaster I brought on Jerusalem and on all the towns of Judah. Today they lie deserted and in ruins"
Jeremiah,44,3,because of the evil they have done. They aroused my anger by burning incense to and worshiping other gods that neither they nor you nor your ancestors ever knew.
Jeremiah,44,4,"Again and again I sent my servants the prophets, who said, ‘Do not do this detestable thing that I hate!’"
Jeremiah,44,5,But they did not listen or pay attention; they did not turn from their wickedness or stop burning incense to other gods.
Jeremiah,44,6,"Therefore, my fierce anger was poured out; it raged against the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem and made them the desolate ruins they are today."
Jeremiah,44,7,"“Now this is what the LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Why bring such great disaster on yourselves by cutting off from Judah the men and women, the children and infants, and so leave yourselves without a remnant?"
Jeremiah,44,8,"Why arouse my anger with what your hands have made, burning incense to other gods in Egypt, where you have come to live? You will destroy yourselves and make yourselves a curse and an object of reproach among all the nations on earth."
Jeremiah,44,9,Have you forgotten the wickedness committed by your ancestors and by the kings and queens of Judah and the wickedness committed by you and your wives in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem?
Jeremiah,44,10,"To this day they have not humbled themselves or shown reverence, nor have they followed my law and the decrees I set before you and your ancestors."
Jeremiah,44,11,"“Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I am determined to bring disaster on you and to destroy all Judah."
Jeremiah,44,12,"I will take away the remnant of Judah who were determined to go to Egypt to settle there. They will all perish in Egypt; they will fall by the sword or die from famine. From the least to the greatest, they will die by sword or famine. They will become a curse and an object of horror, a curse and an object of reproach."
Jeremiah,44,13,"I will punish those who live in Egypt with the sword, famine and plague, as I punished Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,44,14,"None of the remnant of Judah who have gone to live in Egypt will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah, to which they long to return and live; none will return except a few fugitives.”"
Jeremiah,44,15,"Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, along with all the women who were present—a large assembly—and all the people living in Lower and Upper Egypt, said to Jeremiah,"
Jeremiah,44,16,“We will not listen to the message you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD!
Jeremiah,44,17,"We will certainly do everything we said we would: We will burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and will pour out drink offerings to her just as we and our ancestors, our kings and our officials did in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. At that time we had plenty of food and were well off and suffered no harm."
Jeremiah,44,18,"But ever since we stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have had nothing and have been perishing by sword and famine.”"
Jeremiah,44,19,"The women added, “When we burned incense to the Queen of Heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, did not our husbands know that we were making cakes impressed with her image and pouring out drink offerings to her?”"
Jeremiah,44,20,"Then Jeremiah said to all the people, both men and women, who were answering him,"
Jeremiah,44,21,"“Did not the LORD remember and call to mind the incense burned in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem by you and your ancestors, your kings and your officials and the people of the land?"
Jeremiah,44,22,"When the LORD could no longer endure your wicked actions and the detestable things you did, your land became a curse and a desolate waste without inhabitants, as it is today."
Jeremiah,44,23,"Because you have burned incense and have sinned against the LORD and have not obeyed him or followed his law or his decrees or his stipulations, this disaster has come upon you, as you now see.”"
Jeremiah,44,24,"Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including the women, “Hear the word of the LORD, all you people of Judah in Egypt."
Jeremiah,44,25,"This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You and your wives have done what you said you would do when you promised, ‘We will certainly carry out the vows we made to burn incense and pour out drink offerings to the Queen of Heaven.’ “Go ahead then, do what you promised! Keep your vows!"
Jeremiah,44,26,"But hear the word of the LORD, all you Jews living in Egypt: ‘I swear by my great name,’ says the LORD, ‘that no one from Judah living anywhere in Egypt will ever again invoke my name or swear, “As surely as the Sovereign LORD lives.”"
Jeremiah,44,27,"For I am watching over them for harm, not for good; the Jews in Egypt will perish by sword and famine until they are all destroyed."
Jeremiah,44,28,Those who escape the sword and return to the land of Judah from Egypt will be very few. Then the whole remnant of Judah who came to live in Egypt will know whose word will stand—mine or theirs.
Jeremiah,44,29,"“‘This will be the sign to you that I will punish you in this place,’ declares the LORD, ‘so that you will know that my threats of harm against you will surely stand.’"
Jeremiah,44,30,"This is what the LORD says: ‘I am going to deliver Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hands of his enemies who want to kill him, just as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the enemy who wanted to kill him.’”"
Jeremiah,45,1,"When Baruch son of Neriah wrote on a scroll the words Jeremiah the prophet dictated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, Jeremiah said this to Baruch:"
Jeremiah,45,2,"“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch:"
Jeremiah,45,3,"You said, ‘Woe to me! The LORD has added sorrow to my pain; I am worn out with groaning and find no rest.’"
Jeremiah,45,4,"But the LORD has told me to say to you, ‘This is what the LORD says: I will overthrow what I have built and uproot what I have planted, throughout the earth."
Jeremiah,45,5,"Should you then seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them. For I will bring disaster on all people, declares the LORD, but wherever you go I will let you escape with your life.’”"
Jeremiah,46,1,This is the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations:
Jeremiah,46,2,"Concerning Egypt: This is the message against the army of Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt, which was defeated at Carchemish on the Euphrates River by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah:"
Jeremiah,46,3,"“Prepare your shields, both large and small, and march out for battle!"
Jeremiah,46,4,"Harness the horses, mount the steeds! Take your positions with helmets on! Polish your spears, put on your armor!"
Jeremiah,46,5,"What do I see? They are terrified, they are retreating, their warriors are defeated. They flee in haste without looking back, and there is terror on every side,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,46,6,“The swift cannot flee nor the strong escape. In the north by the River Euphrates they stumble and fall.
Jeremiah,46,7,"“Who is this that rises like the Nile, like rivers of surging waters?"
Jeremiah,46,8,"Egypt rises like the Nile, like rivers of surging waters. She says, ‘I will rise and cover the earth; I will destroy cities and their people.’"
Jeremiah,46,9,"Charge, you horses! Drive furiously, you charioteers! March on, you warriors—men of Cush and Put who carry shields, men of Lydia who draw the bow."
Jeremiah,46,10,"But that day belongs to the Lord, the LORD Almighty— a day of vengeance, for vengeance on his foes. The sword will devour till it is satisfied, till it has quenched its thirst with blood. For the Lord, the LORD Almighty, will offer sacrifice in the land of the north by the River Euphrates."

Jeremiah,51,35,"May the violence done to our flesh be on Babylon,” say the inhabitants of Zion. “May our blood be on those who live in Babylonia,” says Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,51,36,"Therefore this is what the LORD says: “See, I will defend your cause and avenge you; I will dry up her sea and make her springs dry."
Jeremiah,51,37,"Babylon will be a heap of ruins, a haunt of jackals, an object of horror and scorn, a place where no one lives."
Jeremiah,51,38,"Her people all roar like young lions, they growl like lion cubs."
Jeremiah,51,39,"But while they are aroused, I will set out a feast for them and make them drunk, so that they shout with laughter— then sleep forever and not awake,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,51,40,"“I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams and goats."
Jeremiah,51,41,"“How Sheshak will be captured, the boast of the whole earth seized! How desolate Babylon will be among the nations!"
Jeremiah,51,42,The sea will rise over Babylon; its roaring waves will cover her.
Jeremiah,51,43,"Her towns will be desolate, a dry and desert land, a land where no one lives, through which no one travels."
Jeremiah,51,44,I will punish Bel in Babylon and make him spew out what he has swallowed. The nations will no longer stream to him. And the wall of Babylon will fall.
Jeremiah,51,45,"“Come out of her, my people! Run for your lives! Run from the fierce anger of the LORD."
Jeremiah,51,46,"Do not lose heart or be afraid when rumors are heard in the land; one rumor comes this year, another the next, rumors of violence in the land and of ruler against ruler."
Jeremiah,51,47,For the time will surely come when I will punish the idols of Babylon; her whole land will be disgraced and her slain will all lie fallen within her.
Jeremiah,51,48,"Then heaven and earth and all that is in them will shout for joy over Babylon, for out of the north destroyers will attack her,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,51,49,"“Babylon must fall because of Israel’s slain, just as the slain in all the earth have fallen because of Babylon."
Jeremiah,51,50,"You who have escaped the sword, leave and do not linger! Remember the LORD in a distant land, and call to mind Jerusalem.”"
Jeremiah,51,51,"“We are disgraced, for we have been insulted and shame covers our faces, because foreigners have entered the holy places of the LORD’s house.”"
Jeremiah,51,52,"“But days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when I will punish her idols, and throughout her land the wounded will groan."
Jeremiah,51,53,"Even if Babylon ascends to the heavens and fortifies her lofty stronghold, I will send destroyers against her,” declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,51,54,"“The sound of a cry comes from Babylon, the sound of great destruction from the land of the Babylonians."
Jeremiah,51,55,The LORD will destroy Babylon; he will silence her noisy din. Waves of enemies will rage like great waters; the roar of their voices will resound.
Jeremiah,51,56,"A destroyer will come against Babylon; her warriors will be captured, and their bows will be broken. For the LORD is a God of retribution; he will repay in full."
Jeremiah,51,57,"I will make her officials and wise men drunk, her governors, officers and warriors as well; they will sleep forever and not awake,” declares the King, whose name is the LORD Almighty."
Jeremiah,51,58,"This is what the LORD Almighty says: “Babylon’s thick wall will be leveled and her high gates set on fire; the peoples exhaust themselves for nothing, the nations’ labor is only fuel for the flames.”"
Jeremiah,51,59,"This is the message Jeremiah the prophet gave to the staff officer Seraiah son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went to Babylon with Zedekiah king of Judah in the fourth year of his reign."
Jeremiah,51,60,Jeremiah had written on a scroll about all the disasters that would come upon Babylon—all that had been recorded concerning Babylon.
Jeremiah,51,61,"He said to Seraiah, “When you get to Babylon, see that you read all these words aloud."
Jeremiah,51,62,"Then say, ‘LORD, you have said you will destroy this place, so that neither people nor animals will live in it; it will be desolate forever.’"
Jeremiah,51,63,"When you finish reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates."
Jeremiah,51,64,"Then say, ‘So will Babylon sink to rise no more because of the disaster I will bring on her. And her people will fall.’” The words of Jeremiah end here."
Jeremiah,52,1,"Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah."
Jeremiah,52,2,"He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, just as Jehoiakim had done."
Jeremiah,52,3,"It was because of the LORD’s anger that all this happened to Jerusalem and Judah, and in the end he thrust them from his presence. Now Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,52,4,"So in the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army. They encamped outside the city and built siege works all around it."
Jeremiah,52,5,The city was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
Jeremiah,52,6,By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine in the city had become so severe that there was no food for the people to eat.
Jeremiah,52,7,"Then the city wall was broken through, and the whole army fled. They left the city at night through the gate between the two walls near the king’s garden, though the Babylonians were surrounding the city. They fled toward the Arabah,"
Jeremiah,52,8,"but the Babylonian army pursued King Zedekiah and overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his soldiers were separated from him and scattered,"
Jeremiah,52,9,"and he was captured. He was taken to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced sentence on him."
Jeremiah,52,10,There at Riblah the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes; he also killed all the officials of Judah.
Jeremiah,52,11,"Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon, where he put him in prison till the day of his death."
Jeremiah,52,12,"On the tenth day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard, who served the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,52,13,"He set fire to the temple of the LORD, the royal palace and all the houses of Jerusalem. Every important building he burned down."
Jeremiah,52,14,"The whole Babylonian army, under the commander of the imperial guard, broke down all the walls around Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,52,15,"Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard carried into exile some of the poorest people and those who remained in the city, along with the rest of the craftsmen and those who had deserted to the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,52,16,But Nebuzaradan left behind the rest of the poorest people of the land to work the vineyards and fields.
Jeremiah,52,17,"The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars, the movable stands and the bronze Sea that were at the temple of the LORD and they carried all the bronze to Babylon."
Jeremiah,52,18,"They also took away the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and all the bronze articles used in the temple service."
Jeremiah,52,19,"The commander of the imperial guard took away the basins, censers, sprinkling bowls, pots, lampstands, dishes and bowls used for drink offerings—all that were made of pure gold or silver."
Jeremiah,52,20,"The bronze from the two pillars, the Sea and the twelve bronze bulls under it, and the movable stands, which King Solomon had made for the temple of the LORD, was more than could be weighed."
Jeremiah,52,21,"Each pillar was eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference; each was four fingers thick, and hollow."
Jeremiah,52,22,"The bronze capital on top of one pillar was five cubits high and was decorated with a network and pomegranates of bronze all around. The other pillar, with its pomegranates, was similar."
Jeremiah,52,23,There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; the total number of pomegranates above the surrounding network was a hundred.
Jeremiah,52,24,"The commander of the guard took as prisoners Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank and the three doorkeepers."
Jeremiah,52,25,"Of those still in the city, he took the officer in charge of the fighting men, and seven royal advisers. He also took the secretary who was chief officer in charge of conscripting the people of the land, sixty of whom were found in the city."
Jeremiah,52,26,Nebuzaradan the commander took them all and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
Jeremiah,52,27,"There at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king had them executed. So Judah went into captivity, away from her land."
Jeremiah,52,28,"This is the number of the people Nebuchadnezzar carried into exile: in the seventh year, 3,023 Jews;"
Jeremiah,52,29,"in Nebuchadnezzar’s eighteenth year, 832 people from Jerusalem;"
Jeremiah,52,30,"in his twenty-third year, 745 Jews taken into exile by Nebuzaradan the commander of the imperial guard. There were 4,600 people in all."
Jeremiah,52,31,"In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the year Awel-Marduk became king of Babylon, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, he released Jehoiachin king of Judah and freed him from prison."
Jeremiah,52,32,He spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat of honor higher than those of the other kings who were with him in Babylon.
Jeremiah,52,33,So Jehoiachin put aside his prison clothes and for the rest of his life ate regularly at the king’s table.
Jeremiah,52,34,"Day by day the king of Babylon gave Jehoiachin a regular allowance as long as he lived, till the day of his death."
Lamentations,1,1,"How deserted lies the city, once so full of people! How like a widow is she, who once was great among the nations! She who was queen among the provinces has now become a slave."
Lamentations,1,2,"Bitterly she weeps at night, tears are on her cheeks. Among all her lovers there is no one to comfort her. All her friends have betrayed her; they have become her enemies."
Lamentations,1,3,"After affliction and harsh labor, Judah has gone into exile. She dwells among the nations; she finds no resting place. All who pursue her have overtaken her in the midst of her distress."
Lamentations,1,4,"The roads to Zion mourn, for no one comes to her appointed festivals. All her gateways are desolate, her priests groan, her young women grieve, and she is in bitter anguish."
Lamentations,1,5,"Her foes have become her masters; her enemies are at ease. The LORD has brought her grief because of her many sins. Her children have gone into exile, captive before the foe."
Lamentations,1,6,All the splendor has departed from Daughter Zion. Her princes are like deer that find no pasture; in weakness they have fled before the pursuer.
Lamentations,1,7,"In the days of her affliction and wandering Jerusalem remembers all the treasures that were hers in days of old. When her people fell into enemy hands, there was no one to help her. Her enemies looked at her and laughed at her destruction."
Lamentations,1,8,"Jerusalem has sinned greatly and so has become unclean. All who honored her despise her, for they have all seen her naked; she herself groans and turns away."
Lamentations,1,9,"Her filthiness clung to her skirts; she did not consider her future. Her fall was astounding; there was none to comfort her. “Look, LORD, on my affliction, for the enemy has triumphed.”"
Lamentations,1,10,The enemy laid hands on all her treasures; she saw pagan nations enter her sanctuary— those you had forbidden to enter your assembly.
Lamentations,1,11,"All her people groan as they search for bread; they barter their treasures for food to keep themselves alive. “Look, LORD, and consider, for I am despised.”"
Lamentations,1,12,"“Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? Look around and see. Is any suffering like my suffering that was inflicted on me, that the LORD brought on me in the day of his fierce anger?"
Lamentations,1,13,"“From on high he sent fire, sent it down into my bones. He spread a net for my feet and turned me back. He made me desolate, faint all the day long."
Lamentations,1,14,"“My sins have been bound into a yoke; by his hands they were woven together. They have been hung on my neck, and the Lord has sapped my strength. He has given me into the hands of those I cannot withstand."
Lamentations,1,15,“The Lord has rejected all the warriors in my midst; he has summoned an army against me to crush my young men. In his winepress the Lord has trampled Virgin Daughter Judah.
Lamentations,1,16,"“This is why I weep and my eyes overflow with tears. No one is near to comfort me, no one to restore my spirit. My children are destitute because the enemy has prevailed.”"
Lamentations,1,17,"Zion stretches out her hands, but there is no one to comfort her. The LORD has decreed for Jacob that his neighbors become his foes; Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them."
Lamentations,1,18,"“The LORD is righteous, yet I rebelled against his command. Listen, all you peoples; look on my suffering. My young men and young women have gone into exile."
Lamentations,1,19,“I called to my allies but they betrayed me. My priests and my elders perished in the city while they searched for food to keep themselves alive.
Lamentations,1,20,"“See, LORD, how distressed I am! I am in torment within, and in my heart I am disturbed, for I have been most rebellious. Outside, the sword bereaves; inside, there is only death."
Lamentations,1,21,"“People have heard my groaning, but there is no one to comfort me. All my enemies have heard of my distress; they rejoice at what you have done. May you bring the day you have announced so they may become like me."
Lamentations,1,22,“Let all their wickedness come before you; deal with them as you have dealt with me because of all my sins. My groans are many and my heart is faint.”
Lamentations,2,1,How the Lord has covered Daughter Zion with the cloud of his anger! He has hurled down the splendor of Israel from heaven to earth; he has not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.
Lamentations,2,2,Without pity the Lord has swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob; in his wrath he has torn down the strongholds of Daughter Judah. He has brought her kingdom and its princes down to the ground in dishonor.
Lamentations,2,3,In fierce anger he has cut off every horn of Israel. He has withdrawn his right hand at the approach of the enemy. He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire that consumes everything around it.
Lamentations,2,4,Like an enemy he has strung his bow; his right hand is ready. Like a foe he has slain all who were pleasing to the eye; he has poured out his wrath like fire on the tent of Daughter Zion.
Lamentations,2,5,The Lord is like an enemy; he has swallowed up Israel. He has swallowed up all her palaces and destroyed her strongholds. He has multiplied mourning and lamentation for Daughter Judah.
Lamentations,2,6,He has laid waste his dwelling like a garden; he has destroyed his place of meeting. The LORD has made Zion forget her appointed festivals and her Sabbaths; in his fierce anger he has spurned both king and priest.
Lamentations,2,7,The Lord has rejected his altar and abandoned his sanctuary. He has given the walls of her palaces into the hands of the enemy; they have raised a shout in the house of the LORD as on the day of an appointed festival.
Lamentations,2,8,The LORD determined to tear down the wall around Daughter Zion. He stretched out a measuring line and did not withhold his hand from destroying. He made ramparts and walls lament; together they wasted away.
Lamentations,2,9,"Her gates have sunk into the ground; their bars he has broken and destroyed. Her king and her princes are exiled among the nations, the law is no more, and her prophets no longer find visions from the LORD."
Lamentations,2,10,The elders of Daughter Zion sit on the ground in silence; they have sprinkled dust on their heads and put on sackcloth. The young women of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground.
Lamentations,2,11,"My eyes fail from weeping, I am in torment within; my heart is poured out on the ground because my people are destroyed, because children and infants faint in the streets of the city."
Lamentations,2,12,"They say to their mothers, “Where is bread and wine?” as they faint like the wounded in the streets of the city, as their lives ebb away in their mothers’ arms."
Lamentations,2,13,"What can I say for you? With what can I compare you, Daughter Jerusalem? To what can I liken you, that I may comfort you, Virgin Daughter Zion? Your wound is as deep as the sea. Who can heal you?"
Lamentations,2,14,The visions of your prophets were false and worthless; they did not expose your sin to ward off your captivity. The prophecies they gave you were false and misleading.
Lamentations,2,15,"All who pass your way clap their hands at you; they scoff and shake their heads at Daughter Jerusalem: “Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth?”"
Lamentations,2,16,"All your enemies open their mouths wide against you; they scoff and gnash their teeth and say, “We have swallowed her up. This is the day we have waited for; we have lived to see it.”"
Lamentations,2,17,"The LORD has done what he planned; he has fulfilled his word, which he decreed long ago. He has overthrown you without pity, he has let the enemy gloat over you, he has exalted the horn of your foes."
Lamentations,2,18,"The hearts of the people cry out to the Lord. You walls of Daughter Zion, let your tears flow like a river day and night; give yourself no relief, your eyes no rest."
Lamentations,2,19,"Arise, cry out in the night, as the watches of the night begin; pour out your heart like water in the presence of the Lord. Lift up your hands to him for the lives of your children, who faint from hunger at every street corner."
Lamentations,2,20,"“Look, LORD, and consider: Whom have you ever treated like this? Should women eat their offspring, the children they have cared for? Should priest and prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?"
Lamentations,2,21,“Young and old lie together in the dust of the streets; my young men and young women have fallen by the sword. You have slain them in the day of your anger; you have slaughtered them without pity.
Lamentations,2,22,"“As you summon to a feast day, so you summoned against me terrors on every side. In the day of the LORD’s anger no one escaped or survived; those I cared for and reared my enemy has destroyed.”"
Lamentations,3,1,I am the man who has seen affliction by the rod of the LORD’s wrath.
Lamentations,3,2,He has driven me away and made me walk in darkness rather than light;
Lamentations,3,3,"indeed, he has turned his hand against me again and again, all day long."
Lamentations,3,4,He has made my skin and my flesh grow old and has broken my bones.
Lamentations,3,5,He has besieged me and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.
Lamentations,3,6,He has made me dwell in darkness like those long dead.
Lamentations,3,7,He has walled me in so I cannot escape; he has weighed me down with chains.
Lamentations,3,8,"Even when I call out or cry for help, he shuts out my prayer."
Lamentations,3,9,He has barred my way with blocks of stone; he has made my paths crooked.
Lamentations,3,10,"Like a bear lying in wait, like a lion in hiding,"
Lamentations,3,11,he dragged me from the path and mangled me and left me without help.
Lamentations,3,12,He drew his bow and made me the target for his arrows.
Lamentations,3,13,He pierced my heart with arrows from his quiver.
Lamentations,3,14,I became the laughingstock of all my people; they mock me in song all day long.
Lamentations,3,15,He has filled me with bitter herbs and given me gall to drink.
Lamentations,3,16,He has broken my teeth with gravel; he has trampled me in the dust.
Lamentations,3,17,I have been deprived of peace; I have forgotten what prosperity is.
Lamentations,3,18,"So I say, “My splendor is gone and all that I had hoped from the LORD.”"
Lamentations,3,19,"I remember my affliction and my wandering, the bitterness and the gall."
Lamentations,3,20,"I well remember them, and my soul is downcast within me."
Lamentations,3,21,Yet this I call to mind and therefore I have hope:
Lamentations,3,22,"Because of the LORD’s great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail."
Lamentations,3,23,They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.
Lamentations,3,24,"I say to myself, “The LORD is my portion; therefore I will wait for him.”"
Lamentations,3,25,"The LORD is good to those whose hope is in him, to the one who seeks him;"
Lamentations,3,26,it is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.
Lamentations,3,27,It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is young.
Lamentations,3,28,"Let him sit alone in silence, for the LORD has laid it on him."
Lamentations,3,29,Let him bury his face in the dust— there may yet be hope.
Lamentations,3,30,"Let him offer his cheek to one who would strike him, and let him be filled with disgrace."
Lamentations,3,31,For no one is cast off by the Lord forever.
Lamentations,3,32,"Though he brings grief, he will show compassion, so great is his unfailing love."
Lamentations,3,33,For he does not willingly bring affliction or grief to anyone.
Lamentations,3,34,"To crush underfoot all prisoners in the land,"
Lamentations,3,35,"to deny people their rights before the Most High,"
Lamentations,3,36,to deprive them of justice— would not the Lord see such things?
Lamentations,3,37,Who can speak and have it happen if the Lord has not decreed it?
Lamentations,3,38,Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that both calamities and good things come?
Lamentations,3,39,Why should the living complain when punished for their sins?
Lamentations,3,40,"Let us examine our ways and test them, and let us return to the LORD."
Lamentations,3,41,"Let us lift up our hearts and our hands to God in heaven, and say:"
Lamentations,3,42,“We have sinned and rebelled and you have not forgiven.
Lamentations,3,43,“You have covered yourself with anger and pursued us; you have slain without pity.
Lamentations,3,44,You have covered yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can get through.
Lamentations,3,45,You have made us scum and refuse among the nations.
Lamentations,3,46,“All our enemies have opened their mouths wide against us.
Lamentations,3,47,"We have suffered terror and pitfalls, ruin and destruction.”"
Lamentations,3,48,Streams of tears flow from my eyes because my people are destroyed.
Lamentations,3,49,"My eyes will flow unceasingly, without relief,"
Lamentations,3,50,until the LORD looks down from heaven and sees.
Lamentations,3,51,What I see brings grief to my soul because of all the women of my city.
Lamentations,3,52,Those who were my enemies without cause hunted me like a bird.
Lamentations,3,53,They tried to end my life in a pit and threw stones at me;
Lamentations,3,54,"the waters closed over my head, and I thought I was about to perish."
Lamentations,3,55,"I called on your name, LORD, from the depths of the pit."
Lamentations,3,56,You heard my plea: “Do not close your ears to my cry for relief.”
Lamentations,3,57,"You came near when I called you, and you said, “Do not fear.”"
Lamentations,3,58,"You, Lord, took up my case; you redeemed my life."
Lamentations,3,59,"LORD, you have seen the wrong done to me. Uphold my cause!"
Lamentations,3,60,"You have seen the depth of their vengeance, all their plots against me."
Lamentations,3,61,"LORD, you have heard their insults, all their plots against me—"
Lamentations,3,62,what my enemies whisper and mutter against me all day long.
Lamentations,3,63,"Look at them! Sitting or standing, they mock me in their songs."
Lamentations,3,64,"Pay them back what they deserve, LORD, for what their hands have done."
Lamentations,3,65,"Put a veil over their hearts, and may your curse be on them!"
Lamentations,3,66,Pursue them in anger and destroy them from under the heavens of the LORD.
Lamentations,4,1,"How the gold has lost its luster, the fine gold become dull! The sacred gems are scattered at every street corner."
Lamentations,4,2,"How the precious children of Zion, once worth their weight in gold, are now considered as pots of clay, the work of a potter’s hands!"
Lamentations,4,3,"Even jackals offer their breasts to nurse their young, but my people have become heartless like ostriches in the desert."
Lamentations,4,4,"Because of thirst the infant’s tongue sticks to the roof of its mouth; the children beg for bread, but no one gives it to them."
Lamentations,4,5,Those who once ate delicacies are destitute in the streets. Those brought up in royal purple now lie on ash heaps.
Lamentations,4,6,"The punishment of my people is greater than that of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment without a hand turned to help her."
Lamentations,4,7,"Their princes were brighter than snow and whiter than milk, their bodies more ruddy than rubies, their appearance like lapis lazuli."
Lamentations,4,8,But now they are blacker than soot; they are not recognized in the streets. Their skin has shriveled on their bones; it has become as dry as a stick.
Lamentations,4,9,"Those killed by the sword are better off than those who die of famine; racked with hunger, they waste away for lack of food from the field."
Lamentations,4,10,"With their own hands compassionate women have cooked their own children, who became their food when my people were destroyed."
Lamentations,4,11,The LORD has given full vent to his wrath; he has poured out his fierce anger. He kindled a fire in Zion that consumed her foundations.
Lamentations,4,12,"The kings of the earth did not believe, nor did any of the peoples of the world, that enemies and foes could enter the gates of Jerusalem."
Lamentations,4,13,"But it happened because of the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, who shed within her the blood of the righteous."
Lamentations,4,14,Now they grope through the streets as if they were blind. They are so defiled with blood that no one dares to touch their garments.
Lamentations,4,15,"“Go away! You are unclean!” people cry to them. “Away! Away! Don’t touch us!” When they flee and wander about, people among the nations say, “They can stay here no longer.”"
Lamentations,4,16,"The LORD himself has scattered them; he no longer watches over them. The priests are shown no honor, the elders no favor."
Lamentations,4,17,"Moreover, our eyes failed, looking in vain for help; from our towers we watched for a nation that could not save us."
Lamentations,4,18,"People stalked us at every step, so we could not walk in our streets. Our end was near, our days were numbered, for our end had come."
Lamentations,4,19,Our pursuers were swifter than eagles in the sky; they chased us over the mountains and lay in wait for us in the desert.
Lamentations,4,20,"The LORD’s anointed, our very life breath, was caught in their traps. We thought that under his shadow we would live among the nations."
Lamentations,4,21,"Rejoice and be glad, Daughter Edom, you who live in the land of Uz. But to you also the cup will be passed; you will be drunk and stripped naked."
Lamentations,4,22,"Your punishment will end, Daughter Zion; he will not prolong your exile. But he will punish your sin, Daughter Edom, and expose your wickedness."
Lamentations,5,1,"Remember, LORD, what has happened to us; look, and see our disgrace."
Lamentations,5,2,"Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our homes to foreigners."
Lamentations,5,3,"We have become fatherless, our mothers are widows."
Lamentations,5,4,We must buy the water we drink; our wood can be had only at a price.
Lamentations,5,5,Those who pursue us are at our heels; we are weary and find no rest.
Lamentations,5,6,We submitted to Egypt and Assyria to get enough bread.
Lamentations,5,7,"Our ancestors sinned and are no more, and we bear their punishment."
Lamentations,5,8,"Slaves rule over us, and there is no one to free us from their hands."
Lamentations,5,9,We get our bread at the risk of our lives because of the sword in the desert.
Lamentations,5,10,"Our skin is hot as an oven, feverish from hunger."
Lamentations,5,11,"Women have been violated in Zion, and virgins in the towns of Judah."
Lamentations,5,12,Princes have been hung up by their hands; elders are shown no respect.
Lamentations,5,13,Young men toil at the millstones; boys stagger under loads of wood.
Lamentations,5,14,The elders are gone from the city gate; the young men have stopped their music.
Lamentations,5,15,Joy is gone from our hearts; our dancing has turned to mourning.
Lamentations,5,16,"The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, for we have sinned!"
Lamentations,5,17,"Because of this our hearts are faint, because of these things our eyes grow dim"
Lamentations,5,18,"for Mount Zion, which lies desolate, with jackals prowling over it."
Lamentations,5,19,"You, LORD, reign forever; your throne endures from generation to generation."
Lamentations,5,20,Why do you always forget us? Why do you forsake us so long?
Lamentations,5,21,"Restore us to yourself, LORD, that we may return; renew our days as of old"
Lamentations,5,22,unless you have utterly rejected us and are angry with us beyond measure.
Ezekiel,1,1,"In my thirtieth year, in the fourth month on the fifth day, while I was among the exiles by the Kebar River, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God."
Ezekiel,1,2,On the fifth of the month—it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin—
Ezekiel,1,3,"the word of the LORD came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, by the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians. There the hand of the LORD was on him."
Ezekiel,1,4,"I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north—an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal,"
Ezekiel,1,5,"and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was human,"
Ezekiel,1,6,but each of them had four faces and four wings.
Ezekiel,1,7,Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze.
Ezekiel,1,8,"Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. All four of them had faces and wings,"
Ezekiel,1,9,and the wings of one touched the wings of another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved.
Ezekiel,1,10,"Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a human being, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle."
Ezekiel,1,11,"Such were their faces. They each had two wings spreading out upward, each wing touching that of the creature on either side; and each had two other wings covering its body."
Ezekiel,1,12,"Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went."
Ezekiel,1,13,"The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it."
Ezekiel,1,14,The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning.
Ezekiel,1,15,"As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces."
Ezekiel,1,16,"This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like topaz, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel."
Ezekiel,1,17,"As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not change direction as the creatures went."
Ezekiel,1,18,"Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around."
Ezekiel,1,19,"When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose."
Ezekiel,1,20,"Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels."
Ezekiel,1,21,"When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels."
Ezekiel,1,22,"Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked something like a vault, sparkling like crystal, and awesome."
Ezekiel,1,23,"Under the vault their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body."
Ezekiel,1,24,"When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty, like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings."
Ezekiel,1,25,Then there came a voice from above the vault over their heads as they stood with lowered wings.
Ezekiel,1,26,"Above the vault over their heads was what looked like a throne of lapis lazuli, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man."
Ezekiel,1,27,"I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him."
Ezekiel,1,28,"Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking."
Ezekiel,2,1,"He said to me, “Son of man, stand up on your feet and I will speak to you.”"
Ezekiel,2,2,"As he spoke, the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet, and I heard him speaking to me."
Ezekiel,2,3,"He said: “Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me; they and their ancestors have been in revolt against me to this very day."
Ezekiel,2,4,"The people to whom I am sending you are obstinate and stubborn. Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says.’"
Ezekiel,2,5,And whether they listen or fail to listen—for they are a rebellious people—they will know that a prophet has been among them.
Ezekiel,2,6,"And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words. Do not be afraid, though briers and thorns are all around you and you live among scorpions. Do not be afraid of what they say or be terrified by them, though they are a rebellious people."
Ezekiel,2,7,"You must speak my words to them, whether they listen or fail to listen, for they are rebellious."
Ezekiel,2,8,"But you, son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not rebel like that rebellious people; open your mouth and eat what I give you.”"
Ezekiel,2,9,"Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll,"
Ezekiel,2,10,which he unrolled before me. On both sides of it were written words of lament and mourning and woe.
Ezekiel,3,1,"And he said to me, “Son of man, eat what is before you, eat this scroll; then go and speak to the people of Israel.”"
Ezekiel,3,2,"So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat."
Ezekiel,3,3,"Then he said to me, “Son of man, eat this scroll I am giving you and fill your stomach with it.” So I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth."
Ezekiel,3,4,"He then said to me: “Son of man, go now to the people of Israel and speak my words to them."
Ezekiel,3,5,"You are not being sent to a people of obscure speech and strange language, but to the people of Israel—"
Ezekiel,3,6,"not to many peoples of obscure speech and strange language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely if I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you."
Ezekiel,3,7,"But the people of Israel are not willing to listen to you because they are not willing to listen to me, for all the Israelites are hardened and obstinate."
Ezekiel,3,8,But I will make you as unyielding and hardened as they are.
Ezekiel,3,9,"I will make your forehead like the hardest stone, harder than flint. Do not be afraid of them or terrified by them, though they are a rebellious people.”"
Ezekiel,3,10,"And he said to me, “Son of man, listen carefully and take to heart all the words I speak to you."
Ezekiel,3,11,"Go now to your people in exile and speak to them. Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says,’ whether they listen or fail to listen.”"
Ezekiel,3,12,"Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a loud rumbling sound as the glory of the LORD rose from the place where it was standing."
Ezekiel,3,13,"It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them, a loud rumbling sound."
Ezekiel,3,14,"The Spirit then lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit, with the strong hand of the LORD on me."
Ezekiel,3,15,"I came to the exiles who lived at Tel Aviv near the Kebar River. And there, where they were living, I sat among them for seven days—deeply distressed."
Ezekiel,3,16,At the end of seven days the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,3,17,"“Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the people of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me."
Ezekiel,3,18,"When I say to a wicked person, ‘You will surely die,’ and you do not warn them or speak out to dissuade them from their evil ways in order to save their life, that wicked person will die for their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood."
Ezekiel,3,19,"But if you do warn the wicked person and they do not turn from their wickedness or from their evil ways, they will die for their sin; but you will have saved yourself."
Ezekiel,3,20,"“Again, when a righteous person turns from their righteousness and does evil, and I put a stumbling block before them, they will die. Since you did not warn them, they will die for their sin. The righteous things that person did will not be remembered, and I will hold you accountable for their blood."
Ezekiel,3,21,"But if you do warn the righteous person not to sin and they do not sin, they will surely live because they took warning, and you will have saved yourself.”"
Ezekiel,3,22,"The hand of the LORD was on me there, and he said to me, “Get up and go out to the plain, and there I will speak to you.”"
Ezekiel,3,23,"So I got up and went out to the plain. And the glory of the LORD was standing there, like the glory I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell facedown."
Ezekiel,3,24,"Then the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet. He spoke to me and said: “Go, shut yourself inside your house."
Ezekiel,3,25,"And you, son of man, they will tie with ropes; you will be bound so that you cannot go out among the people."
Ezekiel,3,26,"I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be silent and unable to rebuke them, for they are a rebellious people."
Ezekiel,3,27,"But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth and you shall say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says.’ Whoever will listen let them listen, and whoever will refuse let them refuse; for they are a rebellious people."
Ezekiel,4,1,"“Now, son of man, take a block of clay, put it in front of you and draw the city of Jerusalem on it."
Ezekiel,4,2,"Then lay siege to it: Erect siege works against it, build a ramp up to it, set up camps against it and put battering rams around it."
Ezekiel,4,3,"Then take an iron pan, place it as an iron wall between you and the city and turn your face toward it. It will be under siege, and you shall besiege it. This will be a sign to the people of Israel."
Ezekiel,4,4,“Then lie on your left side and put the sin of the people of Israel upon yourself. You are to bear their sin for the number of days you lie on your side.
Ezekiel,4,5,I have assigned you the same number of days as the years of their sin. So for 390 days you will bear the sin of the people of Israel.
Ezekiel,4,6,"“After you have finished this, lie down again, this time on your right side, and bear the sin of the people of Judah. I have assigned you 40 days, a day for each year."
Ezekiel,4,7,Turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem and with bared arm prophesy against her.
Ezekiel,4,8,I will tie you up with ropes so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have finished the days of your siege.
Ezekiel,4,9,"“Take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and spelt; put them in a storage jar and use them to make bread for yourself. You are to eat it during the 390 days you lie on your side."
Ezekiel,4,10,Weigh out twenty shekels of food to eat each day and eat it at set times.
Ezekiel,4,11,Also measure out a sixth of a hin of water and drink it at set times.
Ezekiel,4,12,"Eat the food as you would a loaf of barley bread; bake it in the sight of the people, using human excrement for fuel.”"
Ezekiel,4,13,"The LORD said, “In this way the people of Israel will eat defiled food among the nations where I will drive them.”"
Ezekiel,4,14,"Then I said, “Not so, Sovereign LORD! I have never defiled myself. From my youth until now I have never eaten anything found dead or torn by wild animals. No impure meat has ever entered my mouth.”"
Ezekiel,4,15,"“Very well,” he said, “I will let you bake your bread over cow dung instead of human excrement.”"
Ezekiel,4,16,"He then said to me: “Son of man, I am about to cut off the food supply in Jerusalem. The people will eat rationed food in anxiety and drink rationed water in despair,"
Ezekiel,4,17,for food and water will be scarce. They will be appalled at the sight of each other and will waste away because of their sin.
Ezekiel,5,1,"“Now, son of man, take a sharp sword and use it as a barber’s razor to shave your head and your beard. Then take a set of scales and divide up the hair."
Ezekiel,5,2,"When the days of your siege come to an end, burn a third of the hair inside the city. Take a third and strike it with the sword all around the city. And scatter a third to the wind. For I will pursue them with drawn sword."
Ezekiel,5,3,But take a few hairs and tuck them away in the folds of your garment.
Ezekiel,5,4,"Again, take a few of these and throw them into the fire and burn them up. A fire will spread from there to all Israel."
Ezekiel,5,5,"“This is what the Sovereign LORD says: This is Jerusalem, which I have set in the center of the nations, with countries all around her."
Ezekiel,5,6,Yet in her wickedness she has rebelled against my laws and decrees more than the nations and countries around her. She has rejected my laws and has not followed my decrees.
Ezekiel,5,7,“Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: You have been more unruly than the nations around you and have not followed my decrees or kept my laws. You have not even conformed to the standards of the nations around you.
Ezekiel,5,8,"“Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I myself am against you, Jerusalem, and I will inflict punishment on you in the sight of the nations."
Ezekiel,5,9,"Because of all your detestable idols, I will do to you what I have never done before and will never do again."
Ezekiel,5,10,"Therefore in your midst parents will eat their children, and children will eat their parents. I will inflict punishment on you and will scatter all your survivors to the winds."
Ezekiel,5,11,"Therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your vile images and detestable practices, I myself will shave you; I will not look on you with pity or spare you."
Ezekiel,5,12,A third of your people will die of the plague or perish by famine inside you; a third will fall by the sword outside your walls; and a third I will scatter to the winds and pursue with drawn sword.
Ezekiel,5,13,"“Then my anger will cease and my wrath against them will subside, and I will be avenged. And when I have spent my wrath on them, they will know that I the LORD have spoken in my zeal."
Ezekiel,5,14,"“I will make you a ruin and a reproach among the nations around you, in the sight of all who pass by."
Ezekiel,5,15,"You will be a reproach and a taunt, a warning and an object of horror to the nations around you when I inflict punishment on you in anger and in wrath and with stinging rebuke. I the LORD have spoken."
Ezekiel,5,16,"When I shoot at you with my deadly and destructive arrows of famine, I will shoot to destroy you. I will bring more and more famine upon you and cut off your supply of food."
Ezekiel,5,17,"I will send famine and wild beasts against you, and they will leave you childless. Plague and bloodshed will sweep through you, and I will bring the sword against you. I the LORD have spoken.”"
Ezekiel,6,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,6,2,"“Son of man, set your face against the mountains of Israel; prophesy against them"
Ezekiel,6,3,"and say: ‘You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign LORD. This is what the Sovereign LORD says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys: I am about to bring a sword against you, and I will destroy your high places."
Ezekiel,6,4,Your altars will be demolished and your incense altars will be smashed; and I will slay your people in front of your idols.
Ezekiel,6,5,"I will lay the dead bodies of the Israelites in front of their idols, and I will scatter your bones around your altars."
Ezekiel,6,6,"Wherever you live, the towns will be laid waste and the high places demolished, so that your altars will be laid waste and devastated, your idols smashed and ruined, your incense altars broken down, and what you have made wiped out."
Ezekiel,6,7,"Your people will fall slain among you, and you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,6,8,"“‘But I will spare some, for some of you will escape the sword when you are scattered among the lands and nations."
Ezekiel,6,9,"Then in the nations where they have been carried captive, those who escape will remember me—how I have been grieved by their adulterous hearts, which have turned away from me, and by their eyes, which have lusted after their idols. They will loathe themselves for the evil they have done and for all their detestable practices."
Ezekiel,6,10,And they will know that I am the LORD; I did not threaten in vain to bring this calamity on them.
Ezekiel,6,11,"“‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Strike your hands together and stamp your feet and cry out “Alas!” because of all the wicked and detestable practices of the people of Israel, for they will fall by the sword, famine and plague."
Ezekiel,6,12,"One who is far away will die of the plague, and one who is near will fall by the sword, and anyone who survives and is spared will die of famine. So will I pour out my wrath on them."
Ezekiel,6,13,"And they will know that I am the LORD, when their people lie slain among their idols around their altars, on every high hill and on all the mountaintops, under every spreading tree and every leafy oak—places where they offered fragrant incense to all their idols."
Ezekiel,6,14,And I will stretch out my hand against them and make the land a desolate waste from the desert to Diblah—wherever they live. Then they will know that I am the LORD.’”
Ezekiel,7,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,7,2,"“Son of man, this is what the Sovereign LORD says to the land of Israel: “‘The end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land!"
Ezekiel,7,3,"The end is now upon you, and I will unleash my anger against you. I will judge you according to your conduct and repay you for all your detestable practices."
Ezekiel,7,4,I will not look on you with pity; I will not spare you. I will surely repay you for your conduct and for the detestable practices among you. “‘Then you will know that I am the LORD.’
Ezekiel,7,5,"“This is what the Sovereign LORD says: “‘Disaster! Unheard-of disaster! See, it comes!"
Ezekiel,7,6,"The end has come! The end has come! It has roused itself against you. See, it comes!"
Ezekiel,7,7,"Doom has come upon you, upon you who dwell in the land. The time has come! The day is near! There is panic, not joy, on the mountains."
Ezekiel,7,8,I am about to pour out my wrath on you and spend my anger against you. I will judge you according to your conduct and repay you for all your detestable practices.
Ezekiel,7,9,I will not look on you with pity; I will not spare you. I will repay you for your conduct and for the detestable practices among you. “‘Then you will know that it is I the LORD who strikes you.
Ezekiel,7,10,"“‘See, the day! See, it comes! Doom has burst forth, the rod has budded, arrogance has blossomed!"
Ezekiel,7,11,"Violence has arisen, a rod to punish the wicked. None of the people will be left, none of that crowd— none of their wealth, nothing of value."
Ezekiel,7,12,"The time has come! The day has arrived! Let not the buyer rejoice nor the seller grieve, for my wrath is on the whole crowd."
Ezekiel,7,13,"The seller will not recover the property that was sold— as long as both buyer and seller live. For the vision concerning the whole crowd will not be reversed. Because of their sins, not one of them will preserve their life."
Ezekiel,7,14,"“‘They have blown the trumpet, they have made all things ready, but no one will go into battle, for my wrath is on the whole crowd."
Ezekiel,7,15,Outside is the sword; inside are plague and famine. Those in the country will die by the sword; those in the city will be devoured by famine and plague.
Ezekiel,7,16,"The fugitives who escape will flee to the mountains. Like doves of the valleys, they will all moan, each for their own sins."
Ezekiel,7,17,Every hand will go limp; every leg will be wet with urine.
Ezekiel,7,18,"They will put on sackcloth and be clothed with terror. Every face will be covered with shame, and every head will be shaved."
Ezekiel,7,19,"“‘They will throw their silver into the streets, and their gold will be treated as a thing unclean. Their silver and gold will not be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD’s wrath. It will not satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs, for it has caused them to stumble into sin."
Ezekiel,7,20,They took pride in their beautiful jewelry and used it to make their detestable idols. They made it into vile images; therefore I will make it a thing unclean for them.
Ezekiel,7,21,"I will give their wealth as plunder to foreigners and as loot to the wicked of the earth, who will defile it."
Ezekiel,7,22,"I will turn my face away from the people, and robbers will desecrate the place I treasure. They will enter it and will defile it."
Ezekiel,7,23,"“‘Prepare chains! For the land is full of bloodshed, and the city is full of violence."
Ezekiel,7,24,"I will bring the most wicked of nations to take possession of their houses. I will put an end to the pride of the mighty, and their sanctuaries will be desecrated."
Ezekiel,7,25,"When terror comes, they will seek peace in vain."
Ezekiel,7,26,"Calamity upon calamity will come, and rumor upon rumor. They will go searching for a vision from the prophet, priestly instruction in the law will cease, the counsel of the elders will come to an end."
Ezekiel,7,27,"The king will mourn, the prince will be clothed with despair, and the hands of the people of the land will tremble. I will deal with them according to their conduct, and by their own standards I will judge them. “‘Then they will know that I am the LORD.’”"
Ezekiel,8,1,"In the sixth year, in the sixth month on the fifth day, while I was sitting in my house and the elders of Judah were sitting before me, the hand of the Sovereign LORD came on me there."
Ezekiel,8,2,"I looked, and I saw a figure like that of a man. From what appeared to be his waist down he was like fire, and from there up his appearance was as bright as glowing metal."
Ezekiel,8,3,"He stretched out what looked like a hand and took me by the hair of my head. The Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and in visions of God he took me to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court, where the idol that provokes to jealousy stood."
Ezekiel,8,4,"And there before me was the glory of the God of Israel, as in the vision I had seen in the plain."
Ezekiel,8,5,"Then he said to me, “Son of man, look toward the north.” So I looked, and in the entrance north of the gate of the altar I saw this idol of jealousy."
Ezekiel,8,6,"And he said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing—the utterly detestable things the Israelites are doing here, things that will drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see things that are even more detestable.”"
Ezekiel,8,7,"Then he brought me to the entrance to the court. I looked, and I saw a hole in the wall."
Ezekiel,8,8,"He said to me, “Son of man, now dig into the wall.” So I dug into the wall and saw a doorway there."
Ezekiel,8,9,"And he said to me, “Go in and see the wicked and detestable things they are doing here.”"
Ezekiel,8,10,"So I went in and looked, and I saw portrayed all over the walls all kinds of crawling things and unclean animals and all the idols of Israel."
Ezekiel,8,11,"In front of them stood seventy elders of Israel, and Jaazaniah son of Shaphan was standing among them. Each had a censer in his hand, and a fragrant cloud of incense was rising."
Ezekiel,8,12,"He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of Israel are doing in the darkness, each at the shrine of his own idol? They say, ‘The LORD does not see us; the LORD has forsaken the land.’”"
Ezekiel,8,13,"Again, he said, “You will see them doing things that are even more detestable.”"
Ezekiel,8,14,"Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the LORD, and I saw women sitting there, mourning the god Tammuz."
Ezekiel,8,15,"He said to me, “Do you see this, son of man? You will see things that are even more detestable than this.”"
Ezekiel,8,16,"He then brought me into the inner court of the house of the LORD, and there at the entrance to the temple, between the portico and the altar, were about twenty-five men. With their backs toward the temple of the LORD and their faces toward the east, they were bowing down to the sun in the east."
Ezekiel,8,17,"He said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? Is it a trivial matter for the people of Judah to do the detestable things they are doing here? Must they also fill the land with violence and continually arouse my anger? Look at them putting the branch to their nose!"
Ezekiel,8,18,"Therefore I will deal with them in anger; I will not look on them with pity or spare them. Although they shout in my ears, I will not listen to them.”"
Ezekiel,9,1,"Then I heard him call out in a loud voice, “Bring near those who are appointed to execute judgment on the city, each with a weapon in his hand.”"
Ezekiel,9,2,"And I saw six men coming from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with a deadly weapon in his hand. With them was a man clothed in linen who had a writing kit at his side. They came in and stood beside the bronze altar."
Ezekiel,9,3,"Now the glory of the God of Israel went up from above the cherubim, where it had been, and moved to the threshold of the temple. Then the LORD called to the man clothed in linen who had the writing kit at his side"
Ezekiel,9,4,"and said to him, “Go throughout the city of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the detestable things that are done in it.”"
Ezekiel,9,5,"As I listened, he said to the others, “Follow him through the city and kill, without showing pity or compassion."
Ezekiel,9,6,"Slaughter the old men, the young men and women, the mothers and children, but do not touch anyone who has the mark. Begin at my sanctuary.” So they began with the old men who were in front of the temple."
Ezekiel,9,7,"Then he said to them, “Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go!” So they went out and began killing throughout the city."
Ezekiel,9,8,"While they were killing and I was left alone, I fell facedown, crying out, “Alas, Sovereign LORD! Are you going to destroy the entire remnant of Israel in this outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem?”"
Ezekiel,9,9,"He answered me, “The sin of the people of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great; the land is full of bloodshed and the city is full of injustice. They say, ‘The LORD has forsaken the land; the LORD does not see.’"
Ezekiel,9,10,"So I will not look on them with pity or spare them, but I will bring down on their own heads what they have done.”"
Ezekiel,9,11,"Then the man in linen with the writing kit at his side brought back word, saying, “I have done as you commanded.”"
Ezekiel,10,1,"I looked, and I saw the likeness of a throne of lapis lazuli above the vault that was over the heads of the cherubim."
Ezekiel,10,2,"The LORD said to the man clothed in linen, “Go in among the wheels beneath the cherubim. Fill your hands with burning coals from among the cherubim and scatter them over the city.” And as I watched, he went in."
Ezekiel,10,3,"Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court."
Ezekiel,10,4,"Then the glory of the LORD rose from above the cherubim and moved to the threshold of the temple. The cloud filled the temple, and the court was full of the radiance of the glory of the LORD."
Ezekiel,10,5,"The sound of the wings of the cherubim could be heard as far away as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks."
Ezekiel,10,6,"When the LORD commanded the man in linen, “Take fire from among the wheels, from among the cherubim,” the man went in and stood beside a wheel."
Ezekiel,10,7,"Then one of the cherubim reached out his hand to the fire that was among them. He took up some of it and put it into the hands of the man in linen, who took it and went out."
Ezekiel,10,8,(Under the wings of the cherubim could be seen what looked like human hands.)
Ezekiel,10,9,"I looked, and I saw beside the cherubim four wheels, one beside each of the cherubim; the wheels sparkled like topaz."
Ezekiel,10,10,"As for their appearance, the four of them looked alike; each was like a wheel intersecting a wheel."
Ezekiel,10,11,"As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the cherubim faced; the wheels did not turn about as the cherubim went. The cherubim went in whatever direction the head faced, without turning as they went."
Ezekiel,10,12,"Their entire bodies, including their backs, their hands and their wings, were completely full of eyes, as were their four wheels."
Ezekiel,10,13,I heard the wheels being called “the whirling wheels.”
Ezekiel,10,14,"Each of the cherubim had four faces: One face was that of a cherub, the second the face of a human being, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle."
Ezekiel,10,15,Then the cherubim rose upward. These were the living creatures I had seen by the Kebar River.
Ezekiel,10,16,"When the cherubim moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the cherubim spread their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels did not leave their side."
Ezekiel,10,17,"When the cherubim stood still, they also stood still; and when the cherubim rose, they rose with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in them."
Ezekiel,10,18,Then the glory of the LORD departed from over the threshold of the temple and stopped above the cherubim.
Ezekiel,10,19,"While I watched, the cherubim spread their wings and rose from the ground, and as they went, the wheels went with them. They stopped at the entrance of the east gate of the LORD’s house, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them."
Ezekiel,10,20,"These were the living creatures I had seen beneath the God of Israel by the Kebar River, and I realized that they were cherubim."
Ezekiel,10,21,"Each had four faces and four wings, and under their wings was what looked like human hands."
Ezekiel,10,22,Their faces had the same appearance as those I had seen by the Kebar River. Each one went straight ahead.
Ezekiel,11,1,"Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the gate of the house of the LORD that faces east. There at the entrance of the gate were twenty-five men, and I saw among them Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people."
Ezekiel,11,2,"The LORD said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who are plotting evil and giving wicked advice in this city."
Ezekiel,11,3,"They say, ‘Haven’t our houses been recently rebuilt? This city is a pot, and we are the meat in it.’"
Ezekiel,11,4,"Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, son of man.”"
Ezekiel,11,5,"Then the Spirit of the LORD came on me, and he told me to say: “This is what the LORD says: That is what you are saying, you leaders in Israel, but I know what is going through your mind."
Ezekiel,11,6,You have killed many people in this city and filled its streets with the dead.
Ezekiel,11,7,"“Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: The bodies you have thrown there are the meat and this city is the pot, but I will drive you out of it."
Ezekiel,11,8,"You fear the sword, and the sword is what I will bring against you, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,11,9,I will drive you out of the city and deliver you into the hands of foreigners and inflict punishment on you.
Ezekiel,11,10,"You will fall by the sword, and I will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,11,11,"This city will not be a pot for you, nor will you be the meat in it; I will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel."
Ezekiel,11,12,"And you will know that I am the LORD, for you have not followed my decrees or kept my laws but have conformed to the standards of the nations around you.”"
Ezekiel,11,13,"Now as I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell facedown and cried out in a loud voice, “Alas, Sovereign LORD! Will you completely destroy the remnant of Israel?”"
Ezekiel,11,14,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,11,15,"“Son of man, the people of Jerusalem have said of your fellow exiles and all the other Israelites, ‘They are far away from the LORD; this land was given to us as our possession.’"
Ezekiel,11,16,"“Therefore say: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Although I sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries, yet for a little while I have been a sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone.’"
Ezekiel,11,17,"“Therefore say: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will gather you from the nations and bring you back from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you back the land of Israel again.’"
Ezekiel,11,18,“They will return to it and remove all its vile images and detestable idols.
Ezekiel,11,19,I will give them an undivided heart and put a new spirit in them; I will remove from them their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh.
Ezekiel,11,20,"Then they will follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. They will be my people, and I will be their God."
Ezekiel,11,21,"But as for those whose hearts are devoted to their vile images and detestable idols, I will bring down on their own heads what they have done, declares the Sovereign LORD.”"
Ezekiel,11,22,"Then the cherubim, with the wheels beside them, spread their wings, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them."
Ezekiel,11,23,The glory of the LORD went up from within the city and stopped above the mountain east of it.
Ezekiel,11,24,"The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the exiles in Babylonia in the vision given by the Spirit of God. Then the vision I had seen went up from me,"
Ezekiel,11,25,and I told the exiles everything the LORD had shown me.
Ezekiel,12,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,12,2,"“Son of man, you are living among a rebellious people. They have eyes to see but do not see and ears to hear but do not hear, for they are a rebellious people."
Ezekiel,12,3,"“Therefore, son of man, pack your belongings for exile and in the daytime, as they watch, set out and go from where you are to another place. Perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious people."
Ezekiel,12,4,"During the daytime, while they watch, bring out your belongings packed for exile. Then in the evening, while they are watching, go out like those who go into exile."
Ezekiel,12,5,"While they watch, dig through the wall and take your belongings out through it."
Ezekiel,12,6,"Put them on your shoulder as they are watching and carry them out at dusk. Cover your face so that you cannot see the land, for I have made you a sign to the Israelites.”"
Ezekiel,12,7,"So I did as I was commanded. During the day I brought out my things packed for exile. Then in the evening I dug through the wall with my hands. I took my belongings out at dusk, carrying them on my shoulders while they watched."
Ezekiel,12,8,In the morning the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,12,9,"“Son of man, did not the Israelites, that rebellious people, ask you, ‘What are you doing?’"
Ezekiel,12,10,"“Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: This prophecy concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the Israelites who are there.’"
Ezekiel,12,11,"Say to them, ‘I am a sign to you.’ “As I have done, so it will be done to them. They will go into exile as captives."
Ezekiel,12,12,"“The prince among them will put his things on his shoulder at dusk and leave, and a hole will be dug in the wall for him to go through. He will cover his face so that he cannot see the land."
Ezekiel,12,13,"I will spread my net for him, and he will be caught in my snare; I will bring him to Babylonia, the land of the Chaldeans, but he will not see it, and there he will die."
Ezekiel,12,14,I will scatter to the winds all those around him—his staff and all his troops—and I will pursue them with drawn sword.
Ezekiel,12,15,"“They will know that I am the LORD, when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries."
Ezekiel,12,16,"But I will spare a few of them from the sword, famine and plague, so that in the nations where they go they may acknowledge all their detestable practices. Then they will know that I am the LORD.”"
Ezekiel,12,17,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,12,18,"“Son of man, tremble as you eat your food, and shudder in fear as you drink your water."
Ezekiel,12,19,"Say to the people of the land: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says about those living in Jerusalem and in the land of Israel: They will eat their food in anxiety and drink their water in despair, for their land will be stripped of everything in it because of the violence of all who live there."
Ezekiel,12,20,The inhabited towns will be laid waste and the land will be desolate. Then you will know that I am the LORD.’”
Ezekiel,12,21,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,12,22,"“Son of man, what is this proverb you have in the land of Israel: ‘The days go by and every vision comes to nothing’?"
Ezekiel,12,23,"Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am going to put an end to this proverb, and they will no longer quote it in Israel.’ Say to them, ‘The days are near when every vision will be fulfilled."
Ezekiel,12,24,For there will be no more false visions or flattering divinations among the people of Israel.
Ezekiel,12,25,"But I the LORD will speak what I will, and it shall be fulfilled without delay. For in your days, you rebellious people, I will fulfill whatever I say, declares the Sovereign LORD.’”"
Ezekiel,12,26,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,12,27,"“Son of man, the Israelites are saying, ‘The vision he sees is for many years from now, and he prophesies about the distant future.’"
Ezekiel,12,28,"“Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: None of my words will be delayed any longer; whatever I say will be fulfilled, declares the Sovereign LORD.’”"
Ezekiel,13,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,13,2,"“Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who are now prophesying. Say to those who prophesy out of their own imagination: ‘Hear the word of the LORD!"
Ezekiel,13,3,This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing!
Ezekiel,13,4,"Your prophets, Israel, are like jackals among ruins."
Ezekiel,13,5,You have not gone up to the breaches in the wall to repair it for the people of Israel so that it will stand firm in the battle on the day of the LORD.
Ezekiel,13,6,"Their visions are false and their divinations a lie. Even though the LORD has not sent them, they say, “The LORD declares,” and expect him to fulfill their words."
Ezekiel,13,7,"Have you not seen false visions and uttered lying divinations when you say, “The LORD declares,” though I have not spoken?"
Ezekiel,13,8,"“‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because of your false words and lying visions, I am against you, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,13,9,"My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations. They will not belong to the council of my people or be listed in the records of Israel, nor will they enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,13,10,"“‘Because they lead my people astray, saying, “Peace,” when there is no peace, and because, when a flimsy wall is built, they cover it with whitewash,"
Ezekiel,13,11,"therefore tell those who cover it with whitewash that it is going to fall. Rain will come in torrents, and I will send hailstones hurtling down, and violent winds will burst forth."
Ezekiel,13,12,"When the wall collapses, will people not ask you, “Where is the whitewash you covered it with?”"
Ezekiel,13,13,"“‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: In my wrath I will unleash a violent wind, and in my anger hailstones and torrents of rain will fall with destructive fury."
Ezekiel,13,14,"I will tear down the wall you have covered with whitewash and will level it to the ground so that its foundation will be laid bare. When it falls, you will be destroyed in it; and you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,13,15,"So I will pour out my wrath against the wall and against those who covered it with whitewash. I will say to you, “The wall is gone and so are those who whitewashed it,"
Ezekiel,13,16,"those prophets of Israel who prophesied to Jerusalem and saw visions of peace for her when there was no peace, declares the Sovereign LORD.”’"
Ezekiel,13,17,"“Now, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people who prophesy out of their own imagination. Prophesy against them"
Ezekiel,13,18,"and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Woe to the women who sew magic charms on all their wrists and make veils of various lengths for their heads in order to ensnare people. Will you ensnare the lives of my people but preserve your own?"
Ezekiel,13,19,"You have profaned me among my people for a few handfuls of barley and scraps of bread. By lying to my people, who listen to lies, you have killed those who should not have died and have spared those who should not live."
Ezekiel,13,20,“‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against your magic charms with which you ensnare people like birds and I will tear them from your arms; I will set free the people that you ensnare like birds.
Ezekiel,13,21,"I will tear off your veils and save my people from your hands, and they will no longer fall prey to your power. Then you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,13,22,"Because you disheartened the righteous with your lies, when I had brought them no grief, and because you encouraged the wicked not to turn from their evil ways and so save their lives,"
Ezekiel,13,23,therefore you will no longer see false visions or practice divination. I will save my people from your hands. And then you will know that I am the LORD.’”
Ezekiel,14,1,Some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat down in front of me.
Ezekiel,14,2,Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,14,3,"“Son of man, these men have set up idols in their hearts and put wicked stumbling blocks before their faces. Should I let them inquire of me at all?"
Ezekiel,14,4,"Therefore speak to them and tell them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: When any of the Israelites set up idols in their hearts and put a wicked stumbling block before their faces and then go to a prophet, I the LORD will answer them myself in keeping with their great idolatry."
Ezekiel,14,5,"I will do this to recapture the hearts of the people of Israel, who have all deserted me for their idols.’"
Ezekiel,14,6,"“Therefore say to the people of Israel, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Repent! Turn from your idols and renounce all your detestable practices!"
Ezekiel,14,7,"“‘When any of the Israelites or any foreigner residing in Israel separate themselves from me and set up idols in their hearts and put a wicked stumbling block before their faces and then go to a prophet to inquire of me, I the LORD will answer them myself."
Ezekiel,14,8,I will set my face against them and make them an example and a byword. I will remove them from my people. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel,14,9,"“‘And if the prophet is enticed to utter a prophecy, I the LORD have enticed that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him and destroy him from among my people Israel."
Ezekiel,14,10,They will bear their guilt—the prophet will be as guilty as the one who consults him.
Ezekiel,14,11,"Then the people of Israel will no longer stray from me, nor will they defile themselves anymore with all their sins. They will be my people, and I will be their God, declares the Sovereign LORD.’”"
Ezekiel,14,12,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,14,13,"“Son of man, if a country sins against me by being unfaithful and I stretch out my hand against it to cut off its food supply and send famine upon it and kill its people and their animals,"
Ezekiel,14,14,"even if these three men—Noah, Daniel and Job—were in it, they could save only themselves by their righteousness, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,14,15,"“Or if I send wild beasts through that country and they leave it childless and it becomes desolate so that no one can pass through it because of the beasts,"
Ezekiel,14,16,"as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, even if these three men were in it, they could not save their own sons or daughters. They alone would be saved, but the land would be desolate."
Ezekiel,14,17,"“Or if I bring a sword against that country and say, ‘Let the sword pass throughout the land,’ and I kill its people and their animals,"
Ezekiel,14,18,"as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, even if these three men were in it, they could not save their own sons or daughters. They alone would be saved."
Ezekiel,14,19,"“Or if I send a plague into that land and pour out my wrath on it through bloodshed, killing its people and their animals,"
Ezekiel,14,20,"as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, even if Noah, Daniel and Job were in it, they could save neither son nor daughter. They would save only themselves by their righteousness."
Ezekiel,14,21,“For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: How much worse will it be when I send against Jerusalem my four dreadful judgments—sword and famine and wild beasts and plague—to kill its men and their animals!
Ezekiel,14,22,"Yet there will be some survivors—sons and daughters who will be brought out of it. They will come to you, and when you see their conduct and their actions, you will be consoled regarding the disaster I have brought on Jerusalem—every disaster I have brought on it."
Ezekiel,14,23,"You will be consoled when you see their conduct and their actions, for you will know that I have done nothing in it without cause, declares the Sovereign LORD.”"
Ezekiel,15,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,15,2,"“Son of man, how is the wood of a vine different from that of a branch from any of the trees in the forest?"
Ezekiel,15,3,Is wood ever taken from it to make anything useful? Do they make pegs from it to hang things on?
Ezekiel,15,4,"And after it is thrown on the fire as fuel and the fire burns both ends and chars the middle, is it then useful for anything?"
Ezekiel,15,5,"If it was not useful for anything when it was whole, how much less can it be made into something useful when the fire has burned it and it is charred?"
Ezekiel,15,6,"“Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: As I have given the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest as fuel for the fire, so will I treat the people living in Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,15,7,"I will set my face against them. Although they have come out of the fire, the fire will yet consume them. And when I set my face against them, you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,15,8,"I will make the land desolate because they have been unfaithful, declares the Sovereign LORD.”"
Ezekiel,16,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,16,2,"“Son of man, confront Jerusalem with her detestable practices"
Ezekiel,16,3,"and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says to Jerusalem: Your ancestry and birth were in the land of the Canaanites; your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite."
Ezekiel,16,4,"On the day you were born your cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water to make you clean, nor were you rubbed with salt or wrapped in cloths."
Ezekiel,16,5,"No one looked on you with pity or had compassion enough to do any of these things for you. Rather, you were thrown out into the open field, for on the day you were born you were despised."
Ezekiel,16,6,"“‘Then I passed by and saw you kicking about in your blood, and as you lay there in your blood I said to you, “Live!”"
Ezekiel,16,7,"I made you grow like a plant of the field. You grew and developed and entered puberty. Your breasts had formed and your hair had grown, yet you were stark naked."
Ezekiel,16,8,"“‘Later I passed by, and when I looked at you and saw that you were old enough for love, I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your naked body. I gave you my solemn oath and entered into a covenant with you, declares the Sovereign LORD, and you became mine."
Ezekiel,16,9,“‘I bathed you with water and washed the blood from you and put ointments on you.
Ezekiel,16,10,I clothed you with an embroidered dress and put sandals of fine leather on you. I dressed you in fine linen and covered you with costly garments.
Ezekiel,16,11,"I adorned you with jewelry: I put bracelets on your arms and a necklace around your neck,"
Ezekiel,16,12,"and I put a ring on your nose, earrings on your ears and a beautiful crown on your head."
Ezekiel,16,13,"So you were adorned with gold and silver; your clothes were of fine linen and costly fabric and embroidered cloth. Your food was honey, olive oil and the finest flour. You became very beautiful and rose to be a queen."
Ezekiel,16,14,"And your fame spread among the nations on account of your beauty, because the splendor I had given you made your beauty perfect, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,16,15,“‘But you trusted in your beauty and used your fame to become a prostitute. You lavished your favors on anyone who passed by and your beauty became his.
Ezekiel,16,16,"You took some of your garments to make gaudy high places, where you carried on your prostitution. You went to him, and he possessed your beauty."
Ezekiel,16,17,"You also took the fine jewelry I gave you, the jewelry made of my gold and silver, and you made for yourself male idols and engaged in prostitution with them."
Ezekiel,16,18,"And you took your embroidered clothes to put on them, and you offered my oil and incense before them."
Ezekiel,16,19,"Also the food I provided for you—the flour, olive oil and honey I gave you to eat—you offered as fragrant incense before them. That is what happened, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,16,20,“‘And you took your sons and daughters whom you bore to me and sacrificed them as food to the idols. Was your prostitution not enough?
Ezekiel,16,21,You slaughtered my children and sacrificed them to the idols.
Ezekiel,16,22,"In all your detestable practices and your prostitution you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, kicking about in your blood."
Ezekiel,16,23,"“‘Woe! Woe to you, declares the Sovereign LORD. In addition to all your other wickedness,"
Ezekiel,16,24,you built a mound for yourself and made a lofty shrine in every public square.
Ezekiel,16,25,"At every street corner you built your lofty shrines and degraded your beauty, spreading your legs with increasing promiscuity to anyone who passed by."
Ezekiel,16,26,"You engaged in prostitution with the Egyptians, your neighbors with large genitals, and aroused my anger with your increasing promiscuity."
Ezekiel,16,27,"So I stretched out my hand against you and reduced your territory; I gave you over to the greed of your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were shocked by your lewd conduct."
Ezekiel,16,28,"You engaged in prostitution with the Assyrians too, because you were insatiable; and even after that, you still were not satisfied."
Ezekiel,16,29,"Then you increased your promiscuity to include Babylonia, a land of merchants, but even with this you were not satisfied."
Ezekiel,16,30,"“‘I am filled with fury against you, declares the Sovereign LORD, when you do all these things, acting like a brazen prostitute!"
Ezekiel,16,31,"When you built your mounds at every street corner and made your lofty shrines in every public square, you were unlike a prostitute, because you scorned payment."
Ezekiel,16,32,“‘You adulterous wife! You prefer strangers to your own husband!
Ezekiel,16,33,"All prostitutes receive gifts, but you give gifts to all your lovers, bribing them to come to you from everywhere for your illicit favors."
Ezekiel,16,34,"So in your prostitution you are the opposite of others; no one runs after you for your favors. You are the very opposite, for you give payment and none is given to you."
Ezekiel,16,35,"“‘Therefore, you prostitute, hear the word of the LORD!"
Ezekiel,16,36,"This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because you poured out your lust and exposed your naked body in your promiscuity with your lovers, and because of all your detestable idols, and because you gave them your children’s blood,"
Ezekiel,16,37,"therefore I am going to gather all your lovers, with whom you found pleasure, those you loved as well as those you hated. I will gather them against you from all around and will strip you in front of them, and they will see you stark naked."
Ezekiel,16,38,I will sentence you to the punishment of women who commit adultery and who shed blood; I will bring on you the blood vengeance of my wrath and jealous anger.
Ezekiel,16,39,"Then I will deliver you into the hands of your lovers, and they will tear down your mounds and destroy your lofty shrines. They will strip you of your clothes and take your fine jewelry and leave you stark naked."
Ezekiel,16,40,"They will bring a mob against you, who will stone you and hack you to pieces with their swords."
Ezekiel,16,41,"They will burn down your houses and inflict punishment on you in the sight of many women. I will put a stop to your prostitution, and you will no longer pay your lovers."
Ezekiel,16,42,Then my wrath against you will subside and my jealous anger will turn away from you; I will be calm and no longer angry.
Ezekiel,16,43,"“‘Because you did not remember the days of your youth but enraged me with all these things, I will surely bring down on your head what you have done, declares the Sovereign LORD. Did you not add lewdness to all your other detestable practices?"
Ezekiel,16,44,"“‘Everyone who quotes proverbs will quote this proverb about you: “Like mother, like daughter.”"
Ezekiel,16,45,"You are a true daughter of your mother, who despised her husband and her children; and you are a true sister of your sisters, who despised their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite."
Ezekiel,16,46,"Your older sister was Samaria, who lived to the north of you with her daughters; and your younger sister, who lived to the south of you with her daughters, was Sodom."
Ezekiel,16,47,"You not only followed their ways and copied their detestable practices, but in all your ways you soon became more depraved than they."
Ezekiel,16,48,"As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, your sister Sodom and her daughters never did what you and your daughters have done."
Ezekiel,16,49,"“‘Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy."
Ezekiel,16,50,They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen.
Ezekiel,16,51,"Samaria did not commit half the sins you did. You have done more detestable things than they, and have made your sisters seem righteous by all these things you have done."
Ezekiel,16,52,"Bear your disgrace, for you have furnished some justification for your sisters. Because your sins were more vile than theirs, they appear more righteous than you. So then, be ashamed and bear your disgrace, for you have made your sisters appear righteous."
Ezekiel,16,53,"“‘However, I will restore the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters and of Samaria and her daughters, and your fortunes along with them,"
Ezekiel,16,54,so that you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all you have done in giving them comfort.
Ezekiel,16,55,"And your sisters, Sodom with her daughters and Samaria with her daughters, will return to what they were before; and you and your daughters will return to what you were before."
Ezekiel,16,56,"You would not even mention your sister Sodom in the day of your pride,"
Ezekiel,16,57,"before your wickedness was uncovered. Even so, you are now scorned by the daughters of Edom and all her neighbors and the daughters of the Philistines—all those around you who despise you."
Ezekiel,16,58,"You will bear the consequences of your lewdness and your detestable practices, declares the LORD."
Ezekiel,16,59,"“‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will deal with you as you deserve, because you have despised my oath by breaking the covenant."
Ezekiel,16,60,"Yet I will remember the covenant I made with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you."
Ezekiel,16,61,"Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, both those who are older than you and those who are younger. I will give them to you as daughters, but not on the basis of my covenant with you."
Ezekiel,16,62,"So I will establish my covenant with you, and you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,16,63,"Then, when I make atonement for you for all you have done, you will remember and be ashamed and never again open your mouth because of your humiliation, declares the Sovereign LORD.’”"
Ezekiel,17,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,17,2,"“Son of man, set forth an allegory and tell it to the Israelites as a parable."
Ezekiel,17,3,"Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: A great eagle with powerful wings, long feathers and full plumage of varied colors came to Lebanon. Taking hold of the top of a cedar,"
Ezekiel,17,4,"he broke off its topmost shoot and carried it away to a land of merchants, where he planted it in a city of traders."
Ezekiel,17,5,"“‘He took one of the seedlings of the land and put it in fertile soil. He planted it like a willow by abundant water,"
Ezekiel,17,6,"and it sprouted and became a low, spreading vine. Its branches turned toward him, but its roots remained under it. So it became a vine and produced branches and put out leafy boughs."
Ezekiel,17,7,“‘But there was another great eagle with powerful wings and full plumage. The vine now sent out its roots toward him from the plot where it was planted and stretched out its branches to him for water.
Ezekiel,17,8,"It had been planted in good soil by abundant water so that it would produce branches, bear fruit and become a splendid vine.’"
Ezekiel,17,9,"“Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Will it thrive? Will it not be uprooted and stripped of its fruit so that it withers? All its new growth will wither. It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it up by the roots."
Ezekiel,17,10,"It has been planted, but will it thrive? Will it not wither completely when the east wind strikes it—wither away in the plot where it grew?’”"
Ezekiel,17,11,Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,17,12,"“Say to this rebellious people, ‘Do you not know what these things mean?’ Say to them: ‘The king of Babylon went to Jerusalem and carried off her king and her nobles, bringing them back with him to Babylon."
Ezekiel,17,13,"Then he took a member of the royal family and made a treaty with him, putting him under oath. He also carried away the leading men of the land,"
Ezekiel,17,14,"so that the kingdom would be brought low, unable to rise again, surviving only by keeping his treaty."
Ezekiel,17,15,But the king rebelled against him by sending his envoys to Egypt to get horses and a large army. Will he succeed? Will he who does such things escape? Will he break the treaty and yet escape?
Ezekiel,17,16,"“‘As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, he shall die in Babylon, in the land of the king who put him on the throne, whose oath he despised and whose treaty he broke."
Ezekiel,17,17,"Pharaoh with his mighty army and great horde will be of no help to him in war, when ramps are built and siege works erected to destroy many lives."
Ezekiel,17,18,"He despised the oath by breaking the covenant. Because he had given his hand in pledge and yet did all these things, he shall not escape."
Ezekiel,17,19,"“‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: As surely as I live, I will repay him for despising my oath and breaking my covenant."
Ezekiel,17,20,"I will spread my net for him, and he will be caught in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon and execute judgment on him there because he was unfaithful to me."
Ezekiel,17,21,"All his choice troops will fall by the sword, and the survivors will be scattered to the winds. Then you will know that I the LORD have spoken."
Ezekiel,17,22,“‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I myself will take a shoot from the very top of a cedar and plant it; I will break off a tender sprig from its topmost shoots and plant it on a high and lofty mountain.
Ezekiel,17,23,On the mountain heights of Israel I will plant it; it will produce branches and bear fruit and become a splendid cedar. Birds of every kind will nest in it; they will find shelter in the shade of its branches.
Ezekiel,17,24,"All the trees of the forest will know that I the LORD bring down the tall tree and make the low tree grow tall. I dry up the green tree and make the dry tree flourish. “‘I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it.’”"
Ezekiel,18,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,18,2,"“What do you people mean by quoting this proverb about the land of Israel: “‘The parents eat sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge’?"
Ezekiel,18,3,"“As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, you will no longer quote this proverb in Israel."
Ezekiel,18,4,"For everyone belongs to me, the parent as well as the child—both alike belong to me. The one who sins is the one who will die."
Ezekiel,18,5,“Suppose there is a righteous man who does what is just and right.
Ezekiel,18,6,He does not eat at the mountain shrines or look to the idols of Israel. He does not defile his neighbor’s wife or have sexual relations with a woman during her period.
Ezekiel,18,7,"He does not oppress anyone, but returns what he took in pledge for a loan. He does not commit robbery but gives his food to the hungry and provides clothing for the naked."
Ezekiel,18,8,He does not lend to them at interest or take a profit from them. He withholds his hand from doing wrong and judges fairly between two parties.
Ezekiel,18,9,"He follows my decrees and faithfully keeps my laws. That man is righteous; he will surely live, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,18,10,"“Suppose he has a violent son, who sheds blood or does any of these other things"
Ezekiel,18,11,(though the father has done none of them): “He eats at the mountain shrines. He defiles his neighbor’s wife.
Ezekiel,18,12,He oppresses the poor and needy. He commits robbery. He does not return what he took in pledge. He looks to the idols. He does detestable things.
Ezekiel,18,13,"He lends at interest and takes a profit. Will such a man live? He will not! Because he has done all these detestable things, he is to be put to death; his blood will be on his own head."
Ezekiel,18,14,"“But suppose this son has a son who sees all the sins his father commits, and though he sees them, he does not do such things:"
Ezekiel,18,15,“He does not eat at the mountain shrines or look to the idols of Israel. He does not defile his neighbor’s wife.
Ezekiel,18,16,He does not oppress anyone or require a pledge for a loan. He does not commit robbery but gives his food to the hungry and provides clothing for the naked.
Ezekiel,18,17,He withholds his hand from mistreating the poor and takes no interest or profit from them. He keeps my laws and follows my decrees. He will not die for his father’s sin; he will surely live.
Ezekiel,18,18,"But his father will die for his own sin, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother and did what was wrong among his people."
Ezekiel,18,19,"“Yet you ask, ‘Why does the son not share the guilt of his father?’ Since the son has done what is just and right and has been careful to keep all my decrees, he will surely live."
Ezekiel,18,20,"The one who sins is the one who will die. The child will not share the guilt of the parent, nor will the parent share the guilt of the child. The righteousness of the righteous will be credited to them, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against them."
Ezekiel,18,21,"“But if a wicked person turns away from all the sins they have committed and keeps all my decrees and does what is just and right, that person will surely live; they will not die."
Ezekiel,18,22,"None of the offenses they have committed will be remembered against them. Because of the righteous things they have done, they will live."
Ezekiel,18,23,"Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked? declares the Sovereign LORD. Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live?"
Ezekiel,18,24,"“But if a righteous person turns from their righteousness and commits sin and does the same detestable things the wicked person does, will they live? None of the righteous things that person has done will be remembered. Because of the unfaithfulness they are guilty of and because of the sins they have committed, they will die."
Ezekiel,18,25,"“Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ Hear, you Israelites: Is my way unjust? Is it not your ways that are unjust?"
Ezekiel,18,26,"If a righteous person turns from their righteousness and commits sin, they will die for it; because of the sin they have committed they will die."
Ezekiel,18,27,"But if a wicked person turns away from the wickedness they have committed and does what is just and right, they will save their life."
Ezekiel,18,28,"Because they consider all the offenses they have committed and turn away from them, that person will surely live; they will not die."
Ezekiel,18,29,"Yet the Israelites say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ Are my ways unjust, people of Israel? Is it not your ways that are unjust?"
Ezekiel,18,30,"“Therefore, you Israelites, I will judge each of you according to your own ways, declares the Sovereign LORD. Repent! Turn away from all your offenses; then sin will not be your downfall."
Ezekiel,18,31,"Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committed, and get a new heart and a new spirit. Why will you die, people of Israel?"
Ezekiel,18,32,"For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign LORD. Repent and live!"
Ezekiel,19,1,“Take up a lament concerning the princes of Israel
Ezekiel,19,2,and say: “‘What a lioness was your mother among the lions! She lay down among them and reared her cubs.
Ezekiel,19,3,"She brought up one of her cubs, and he became a strong lion. He learned to tear the prey and he became a man-eater."
Ezekiel,19,4,"The nations heard about him, and he was trapped in their pit. They led him with hooks to the land of Egypt."
Ezekiel,19,5,"“‘When she saw her hope unfulfilled, her expectation gone, she took another of her cubs and made him a strong lion."
Ezekiel,19,6,"He prowled among the lions, for he was now a strong lion. He learned to tear the prey and he became a man-eater."
Ezekiel,19,7,He broke down their strongholds and devastated their towns. The land and all who were in it were terrified by his roaring.
Ezekiel,19,8,"Then the nations came against him, those from regions round about. They spread their net for him, and he was trapped in their pit."
Ezekiel,19,9,"With hooks they pulled him into a cage and brought him to the king of Babylon. They put him in prison, so his roar was heard no longer on the mountains of Israel."
Ezekiel,19,10,“‘Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard planted by the water; it was fruitful and full of branches because of abundant water.
Ezekiel,19,11,"Its branches were strong, fit for a ruler’s scepter. It towered high above the thick foliage, conspicuous for its height and for its many branches."
Ezekiel,19,12,"But it was uprooted in fury and thrown to the ground. The east wind made it shrivel, it was stripped of its fruit; its strong branches withered and fire consumed them."
Ezekiel,19,13,"Now it is planted in the desert, in a dry and thirsty land."
Ezekiel,19,14,Fire spread from one of its main branches and consumed its fruit. No strong branch is left on it fit for a ruler’s scepter.’ “This is a lament and is to be used as a lament.”
Ezekiel,20,1,"In the seventh year, in the fifth month on the tenth day, some of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and they sat down in front of me."
Ezekiel,20,2,Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,20,3,"“Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Have you come to inquire of me? As surely as I live, I will not let you inquire of me, declares the Sovereign LORD.’"
Ezekiel,20,4,"“Will you judge them? Will you judge them, son of man? Then confront them with the detestable practices of their ancestors"
Ezekiel,20,5,"and say to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: On the day I chose Israel, I swore with uplifted hand to the descendants of Jacob and revealed myself to them in Egypt. With uplifted hand I said to them, “I am the LORD your God.”"
Ezekiel,20,6,"On that day I swore to them that I would bring them out of Egypt into a land I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most beautiful of all lands."
Ezekiel,20,7,"And I said to them, “Each of you, get rid of the vile images you have set your eyes on, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.”"
Ezekiel,20,8,"“‘But they rebelled against me and would not listen to me; they did not get rid of the vile images they had set their eyes on, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. So I said I would pour out my wrath on them and spend my anger against them in Egypt."
Ezekiel,20,9,"But for the sake of my name, I brought them out of Egypt. I did it to keep my name from being profaned in the eyes of the nations among whom they lived and in whose sight I had revealed myself to the Israelites."
Ezekiel,20,10,Therefore I led them out of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.
Ezekiel,20,11,"I gave them my decrees and made known to them my laws, by which the person who obeys them will live."
Ezekiel,20,12,"Also I gave them my Sabbaths as a sign between us, so they would know that I the LORD made them holy."
Ezekiel,20,13,“‘Yet the people of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They did not follow my decrees but rejected my laws—by which the person who obeys them will live—and they utterly desecrated my Sabbaths. So I said I would pour out my wrath on them and destroy them in the wilderness.
Ezekiel,20,14,But for the sake of my name I did what would keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out.
Ezekiel,20,15,"Also with uplifted hand I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land I had given them—a land flowing with milk and honey, the most beautiful of all lands—"
Ezekiel,20,16,because they rejected my laws and did not follow my decrees and desecrated my Sabbaths. For their hearts were devoted to their idols.
Ezekiel,20,17,Yet I looked on them with pity and did not destroy them or put an end to them in the wilderness.
Ezekiel,20,18,"I said to their children in the wilderness, “Do not follow the statutes of your parents or keep their laws or defile yourselves with their idols."
Ezekiel,20,19,I am the LORD your God; follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.
Ezekiel,20,20,"Keep my Sabbaths holy, that they may be a sign between us. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God.”"
Ezekiel,20,21,"“‘But the children rebelled against me: They did not follow my decrees, they were not careful to keep my laws, of which I said, “The person who obeys them will live by them,” and they desecrated my Sabbaths. So I said I would pour out my wrath on them and spend my anger against them in the wilderness."
Ezekiel,20,22,"But I withheld my hand, and for the sake of my name I did what would keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out."
Ezekiel,20,23,"Also with uplifted hand I swore to them in the wilderness that I would disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries,"
Ezekiel,20,24,"because they had not obeyed my laws but had rejected my decrees and desecrated my Sabbaths, and their eyes lusted after their parents’ idols."
Ezekiel,20,25,So I gave them other statutes that were not good and laws through which they could not live;
Ezekiel,20,26,I defiled them through their gifts—the sacrifice of every firstborn—that I might fill them with horror so they would know that I am the LORD.’
Ezekiel,20,27,"“Therefore, son of man, speak to the people of Israel and say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: In this also your ancestors blasphemed me by being unfaithful to me:"
Ezekiel,20,28,"When I brought them into the land I had sworn to give them and they saw any high hill or any leafy tree, there they offered their sacrifices, made offerings that aroused my anger, presented their fragrant incense and poured out their drink offerings."
Ezekiel,20,29,Then I said to them: What is this high place you go to?’” (It is called Bamah to this day.)
Ezekiel,20,30,“Therefore say to the Israelites: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Will you defile yourselves the way your ancestors did and lust after their vile images?
Ezekiel,20,31,"When you offer your gifts—the sacrifice of your children in the fire—you continue to defile yourselves with all your idols to this day. Am I to let you inquire of me, you Israelites? As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I will not let you inquire of me."
Ezekiel,20,32,"“‘You say, “We want to be like the nations, like the peoples of the world, who serve wood and stone.” But what you have in mind will never happen."
Ezekiel,20,33,"As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I will reign over you with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with outpoured wrath."
Ezekiel,20,34,I will bring you from the nations and gather you from the countries where you have been scattered—with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with outpoured wrath.
Ezekiel,20,35,"I will bring you into the wilderness of the nations and there, face to face, I will execute judgment upon you."
Ezekiel,20,36,"As I judged your ancestors in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will judge you, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,20,37,"I will take note of you as you pass under my rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant."
Ezekiel,20,38,"I will purge you of those who revolt and rebel against me. Although I will bring them out of the land where they are living, yet they will not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,20,39,"“‘As for you, people of Israel, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Go and serve your idols, every one of you! But afterward you will surely listen to me and no longer profane my holy name with your gifts and idols."
Ezekiel,20,40,"For on my holy mountain, the high mountain of Israel, declares the Sovereign LORD, there in the land all the people of Israel will serve me, and there I will accept them. There I will require your offerings and your choice gifts, along with all your holy sacrifices."
Ezekiel,20,41,"I will accept you as fragrant incense when I bring you out from the nations and gather you from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will be proved holy through you in the sight of the nations."
Ezekiel,20,42,"Then you will know that I am the LORD, when I bring you into the land of Israel, the land I had sworn with uplifted hand to give to your ancestors."
Ezekiel,20,43,"There you will remember your conduct and all the actions by which you have defiled yourselves, and you will loathe yourselves for all the evil you have done."
Ezekiel,20,44,"You will know that I am the LORD, when I deal with you for my name’s sake and not according to your evil ways and your corrupt practices, you people of Israel, declares the Sovereign LORD.’”"
Ezekiel,20,45,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,20,46,"“Son of man, set your face toward the south; preach against the south and prophesy against the forest of the southland."
Ezekiel,20,47,"Say to the southern forest: ‘Hear the word of the LORD. This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am about to set fire to you, and it will consume all your trees, both green and dry. The blazing flame will not be quenched, and every face from south to north will be scorched by it."
Ezekiel,20,48,Everyone will see that I the LORD have kindled it; it will not be quenched.’”
Ezekiel,20,49,"Then I said, “Sovereign LORD, they are saying of me, ‘Isn’t he just telling parables?’”"
Ezekiel,21,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,21,2,"“Son of man, set your face against Jerusalem and preach against the sanctuary. Prophesy against the land of Israel"
Ezekiel,21,3,and say to her: ‘This is what the LORD says: I am against you. I will draw my sword from its sheath and cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked.
Ezekiel,21,4,"Because I am going to cut off the righteous and the wicked, my sword will be unsheathed against everyone from south to north."
Ezekiel,21,5,Then all people will know that I the LORD have drawn my sword from its sheath; it will not return again.’
Ezekiel,21,6,"“Therefore groan, son of man! Groan before them with broken heart and bitter grief."
Ezekiel,21,7,"And when they ask you, ‘Why are you groaning?’ you shall say, ‘Because of the news that is coming. Every heart will melt with fear and every hand go limp; every spirit will become faint and every leg will be wet with urine.’ It is coming! It will surely take place, declares the Sovereign LORD.”"
Ezekiel,21,8,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,21,9,"“Son of man, prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Lord says: “‘A sword, a sword, sharpened and polished—"
Ezekiel,21,10,"sharpened for the slaughter, polished to flash like lightning! “‘Shall we rejoice in the scepter of my royal son? The sword despises every such stick."
Ezekiel,21,11,"“‘The sword is appointed to be polished, to be grasped with the hand; it is sharpened and polished, made ready for the hand of the slayer."
Ezekiel,21,12,"Cry out and wail, son of man, for it is against my people; it is against all the princes of Israel. They are thrown to the sword along with my people. Therefore beat your breast."
Ezekiel,21,13,"“‘Testing will surely come. And what if even the scepter, which the sword despises, does not continue? declares the Sovereign LORD.’"
Ezekiel,21,14,"“So then, son of man, prophesy and strike your hands together. Let the sword strike twice, even three times. It is a sword for slaughter— a sword for great slaughter, closing in on them from every side."
Ezekiel,21,15,"So that hearts may melt with fear and the fallen be many, I have stationed the sword for slaughter at all their gates. Look! It is forged to strike like lightning, it is grasped for slaughter."
Ezekiel,21,16,"Slash to the right, you sword, then to the left, wherever your blade is turned."
Ezekiel,21,17,"I too will strike my hands together, and my wrath will subside. I the LORD have spoken.”"
Ezekiel,21,18,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,21,19,"“Son of man, mark out two roads for the sword of the king of Babylon to take, both starting from the same country. Make a signpost where the road branches off to the city."
Ezekiel,21,20,Mark out one road for the sword to come against Rabbah of the Ammonites and another against Judah and fortified Jerusalem.
Ezekiel,21,21,"For the king of Babylon will stop at the fork in the road, at the junction of the two roads, to seek an omen: He will cast lots with arrows, he will consult his idols, he will examine the liver."
Ezekiel,21,22,"Into his right hand will come the lot for Jerusalem, where he is to set up battering rams, to give the command to slaughter, to sound the battle cry, to set battering rams against the gates, to build a ramp and to erect siege works."
Ezekiel,21,23,"It will seem like a false omen to those who have sworn allegiance to him, but he will remind them of their guilt and take them captive."
Ezekiel,21,24,"“Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: ‘Because you people have brought to mind your guilt by your open rebellion, revealing your sins in all that you do—because you have done this, you will be taken captive."
Ezekiel,21,25,"“‘You profane and wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come, whose time of punishment has reached its climax,"
Ezekiel,21,26,"this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Take off the turban, remove the crown. It will not be as it was: The lowly will be exalted and the exalted will be brought low."
Ezekiel,21,27,A ruin! A ruin! I will make it a ruin! The crown will not be restored until he to whom it rightfully belongs shall come; to him I will give it.’
Ezekiel,21,28,"“And you, son of man, prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says about the Ammonites and their insults: “‘A sword, a sword, drawn for the slaughter, polished to consume and to flash like lightning!"
Ezekiel,21,29,"Despite false visions concerning you and lying divinations about you, it will be laid on the necks of the wicked who are to be slain, whose day has come, whose time of punishment has reached its climax."
Ezekiel,21,30,"“‘Let the sword return to its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your ancestry, I will judge you."
Ezekiel,21,31,"I will pour out my wrath on you and breathe out my fiery anger against you; I will deliver you into the hands of brutal men, men skilled in destruction."
Ezekiel,21,32,"You will be fuel for the fire, your blood will be shed in your land, you will be remembered no more; for I the LORD have spoken.’”"
Ezekiel,22,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,22,2,"“Son of man, will you judge her? Will you judge this city of bloodshed? Then confront her with all her detestable practices"
Ezekiel,22,3,"and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: You city that brings on herself doom by shedding blood in her midst and defiles herself by making idols,"
Ezekiel,22,4,"you have become guilty because of the blood you have shed and have become defiled by the idols you have made. You have brought your days to a close, and the end of your years has come. Therefore I will make you an object of scorn to the nations and a laughingstock to all the countries."
Ezekiel,22,5,"Those who are near and those who are far away will mock you, you infamous city, full of turmoil."
Ezekiel,22,6,“‘See how each of the princes of Israel who are in you uses his power to shed blood.
Ezekiel,22,7,In you they have treated father and mother with contempt; in you they have oppressed the foreigner and mistreated the fatherless and the widow.
Ezekiel,22,8,You have despised my holy things and desecrated my Sabbaths.
Ezekiel,22,9,In you are slanderers who are bent on shedding blood; in you are those who eat at the mountain shrines and commit lewd acts.
Ezekiel,22,10,"In you are those who dishonor their father’s bed; in you are those who violate women during their period, when they are ceremonially unclean."
Ezekiel,22,11,"In you one man commits a detestable offense with his neighbor’s wife, another shamefully defiles his daughter-in-law, and another violates his sister, his own father’s daughter."
Ezekiel,22,12,"In you are people who accept bribes to shed blood; you take interest and make a profit from the poor. You extort unjust gain from your neighbors. And you have forgotten me, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,22,13,“‘I will surely strike my hands together at the unjust gain you have made and at the blood you have shed in your midst.
Ezekiel,22,14,"Will your courage endure or your hands be strong in the day I deal with you? I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it."
Ezekiel,22,15,I will disperse you among the nations and scatter you through the countries; and I will put an end to your uncleanness.
Ezekiel,22,16,"When you have been defiled in the eyes of the nations, you will know that I am the LORD.’”"
Ezekiel,22,17,Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,22,18,"“Son of man, the people of Israel have become dross to me; all of them are the copper, tin, iron and lead left inside a furnace. They are but the dross of silver."
Ezekiel,22,19,"Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: ‘Because you have all become dross, I will gather you into Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,22,20,"As silver, copper, iron, lead and tin are gathered into a furnace to be melted with a fiery blast, so will I gather you in my anger and my wrath and put you inside the city and melt you."
Ezekiel,22,21,"I will gather you and I will blow on you with my fiery wrath, and you will be melted inside her."
Ezekiel,22,22,"As silver is melted in a furnace, so you will be melted inside her, and you will know that I the LORD have poured out my wrath on you.’”"
Ezekiel,22,23,Again the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,22,24,"“Son of man, say to the land, ‘You are a land that has not been cleansed or rained on in the day of wrath.’"
Ezekiel,22,25,"There is a conspiracy of her princes within her like a roaring lion tearing its prey; they devour people, take treasures and precious things and make many widows within her."
Ezekiel,22,26,"Her priests do violence to my law and profane my holy things; they do not distinguish between the holy and the common; they teach that there is no difference between the unclean and the clean; and they shut their eyes to the keeping of my Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them."
Ezekiel,22,27,Her officials within her are like wolves tearing their prey; they shed blood and kill people to make unjust gain.
Ezekiel,22,28,"Her prophets whitewash these deeds for them by false visions and lying divinations. They say, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says’—when the LORD has not spoken."
Ezekiel,22,29,"The people of the land practice extortion and commit robbery; they oppress the poor and needy and mistreat the foreigner, denying them justice."
Ezekiel,22,30,"“I looked for someone among them who would build up the wall and stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land so I would not have to destroy it, but I found no one."
Ezekiel,22,31,"So I will pour out my wrath on them and consume them with my fiery anger, bringing down on their own heads all they have done, declares the Sovereign LORD.”"
Ezekiel,23,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,23,2,"“Son of man, there were two women, daughters of the same mother."
Ezekiel,23,3,"They became prostitutes in Egypt, engaging in prostitution from their youth. In that land their breasts were fondled and their virgin bosoms caressed."
Ezekiel,23,4,"The older was named Oholah, and her sister was Oholibah. They were mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,23,5,"“Oholah engaged in prostitution while she was still mine; and she lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians—warriors"
Ezekiel,23,6,"clothed in blue, governors and commanders, all of them handsome young men, and mounted horsemen."
Ezekiel,23,7,She gave herself as a prostitute to all the elite of the Assyrians and defiled herself with all the idols of everyone she lusted after.
Ezekiel,23,8,"She did not give up the prostitution she began in Egypt, when during her youth men slept with her, caressed her virgin bosom and poured out their lust on her."
Ezekiel,23,9,"“Therefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, the Assyrians, for whom she lusted."
Ezekiel,23,10,"They stripped her naked, took away her sons and daughters and killed her with the sword. She became a byword among women, and punishment was inflicted on her."
Ezekiel,23,11,"“Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet in her lust and prostitution she was more depraved than her sister."
Ezekiel,23,12,"She too lusted after the Assyrians—governors and commanders, warriors in full dress, mounted horsemen, all handsome young men."
Ezekiel,23,13,I saw that she too defiled herself; both of them went the same way.
Ezekiel,23,14,"“But she carried her prostitution still further. She saw men portrayed on a wall, figures of Chaldeans portrayed in red,"
Ezekiel,23,15,"with belts around their waists and flowing turbans on their heads; all of them looked like Babylonian chariot officers, natives of Chaldea."
Ezekiel,23,16,"As soon as she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea."
Ezekiel,23,17,"Then the Babylonians came to her, to the bed of love, and in their lust they defiled her. After she had been defiled by them, she turned away from them in disgust."
Ezekiel,23,18,"When she carried on her prostitution openly and exposed her naked body, I turned away from her in disgust, just as I had turned away from her sister."
Ezekiel,23,19,"Yet she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of her youth, when she was a prostitute in Egypt."
Ezekiel,23,20,"There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses."
Ezekiel,23,21,"So you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when in Egypt your bosom was caressed and your young breasts fondled."
Ezekiel,23,22,"“Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will stir up your lovers against you, those you turned away from in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side—"
Ezekiel,23,23,"the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, the men of Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, handsome young men, all of them governors and commanders, chariot officers and men of high rank, all mounted on horses."
Ezekiel,23,24,"They will come against you with weapons, chariots and wagons and with a throng of people; they will take up positions against you on every side with large and small shields and with helmets. I will turn you over to them for punishment, and they will punish you according to their standards."
Ezekiel,23,25,"I will direct my jealous anger against you, and they will deal with you in fury. They will cut off your noses and your ears, and those of you who are left will fall by the sword. They will take away your sons and daughters, and those of you who are left will be consumed by fire."
Ezekiel,23,26,They will also strip you of your clothes and take your fine jewelry.
Ezekiel,23,27,So I will put a stop to the lewdness and prostitution you began in Egypt. You will not look on these things with longing or remember Egypt anymore.
Ezekiel,23,28,"“For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am about to deliver you into the hands of those you hate, to those you turned away from in disgust."
Ezekiel,23,29,"They will deal with you in hatred and take away everything you have worked for. They will leave you stark naked, and the shame of your prostitution will be exposed. Your lewdness and promiscuity"
Ezekiel,23,30,"have brought this on you, because you lusted after the nations and defiled yourself with their idols."
Ezekiel,23,31,You have gone the way of your sister; so I will put her cup into your hand.
Ezekiel,23,32,"“This is what the Sovereign LORD says: “You will drink your sister’s cup, a cup large and deep; it will bring scorn and derision, for it holds so much."
Ezekiel,23,33,"You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, the cup of ruin and desolation, the cup of your sister Samaria."
Ezekiel,23,34,"You will drink it and drain it dry and chew on its pieces— and you will tear your breasts. I have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,23,35,"“Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Since you have forgotten me and turned your back on me, you must bear the consequences of your lewdness and prostitution.”"
Ezekiel,23,36,"The LORD said to me: “Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then confront them with their detestable practices,"
Ezekiel,23,37,"for they have committed adultery and blood is on their hands. They committed adultery with their idols; they even sacrificed their children, whom they bore to me, as food for them."
Ezekiel,23,38,They have also done this to me: At that same time they defiled my sanctuary and desecrated my Sabbaths.
Ezekiel,23,39,"On the very day they sacrificed their children to their idols, they entered my sanctuary and desecrated it. That is what they did in my house."
Ezekiel,23,40,"“They even sent messengers for men who came from far away, and when they arrived you bathed yourself for them, applied eye makeup and put on your jewelry."
Ezekiel,23,41,"You sat on an elegant couch, with a table spread before it on which you had placed the incense and olive oil that belonged to me."
Ezekiel,23,42,"“The noise of a carefree crowd was around her; drunkards were brought from the desert along with men from the rabble, and they put bracelets on the wrists of the woman and her sister and beautiful crowns on their heads."
Ezekiel,23,43,"Then I said about the one worn out by adultery, ‘Now let them use her as a prostitute, for that is all she is.’"
Ezekiel,23,44,"And they slept with her. As men sleep with a prostitute, so they slept with those lewd women, Oholah and Oholibah."
Ezekiel,23,45,"But righteous judges will sentence them to the punishment of women who commit adultery and shed blood, because they are adulterous and blood is on their hands."
Ezekiel,23,46,“This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Bring a mob against them and give them over to terror and plunder.
Ezekiel,23,47,The mob will stone them and cut them down with their swords; they will kill their sons and daughters and burn down their houses.
Ezekiel,23,48,"“So I will put an end to lewdness in the land, that all women may take warning and not imitate you."
Ezekiel,23,49,You will suffer the penalty for your lewdness and bear the consequences of your sins of idolatry. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign LORD.”
Ezekiel,24,1,"In the ninth year, in the tenth month on the tenth day, the word of the LORD came to me:"
Ezekiel,24,2,"“Son of man, record this date, this very date, because the king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day."
Ezekiel,24,3,Tell this rebellious people a parable and say to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: “‘Put on the cooking pot; put it on and pour water into it.
Ezekiel,24,4,"Put into it the pieces of meat, all the choice pieces—the leg and the shoulder. Fill it with the best of these bones;"
Ezekiel,24,5,take the pick of the flock. Pile wood beneath it for the bones; bring it to a boil and cook the bones in it.
Ezekiel,24,6,"“‘For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: “‘Woe to the city of bloodshed, to the pot now encrusted, whose deposit will not go away! Take the meat out piece by piece in whatever order it comes."
Ezekiel,24,7,"“‘For the blood she shed is in her midst: She poured it on the bare rock; she did not pour it on the ground, where the dust would cover it."
Ezekiel,24,8,"To stir up wrath and take revenge I put her blood on the bare rock, so that it would not be covered."
Ezekiel,24,9,"“‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: “‘Woe to the city of bloodshed! I, too, will pile the wood high."
Ezekiel,24,10,"So heap on the wood and kindle the fire. Cook the meat well, mixing in the spices; and let the bones be charred."
Ezekiel,24,11,"Then set the empty pot on the coals till it becomes hot and its copper glows, so that its impurities may be melted and its deposit burned away."
Ezekiel,24,12,"It has frustrated all efforts; its heavy deposit has not been removed, not even by fire."
Ezekiel,24,13,"“‘Now your impurity is lewdness. Because I tried to cleanse you but you would not be cleansed from your impurity, you will not be clean again until my wrath against you has subsided."
Ezekiel,24,14,"“‘I the LORD have spoken. The time has come for me to act. I will not hold back; I will not have pity, nor will I relent. You will be judged according to your conduct and your actions, declares the Sovereign LORD.’”"
Ezekiel,24,15,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,24,16,"“Son of man, with one blow I am about to take away from you the delight of your eyes. Yet do not lament or weep or shed any tears."
Ezekiel,24,17,Groan quietly; do not mourn for the dead. Keep your turban fastened and your sandals on your feet; do not cover your mustache and beard or eat the customary food of mourners.”
Ezekiel,24,18,"So I spoke to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died. The next morning I did as I had been commanded."
Ezekiel,24,19,"Then the people asked me, “Won’t you tell us what these things have to do with us? Why are you acting like this?”"
Ezekiel,24,20,"So I said to them, “The word of the LORD came to me:"
Ezekiel,24,21,"Say to the people of Israel, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am about to desecrate my sanctuary—the stronghold in which you take pride, the delight of your eyes, the object of your affection. The sons and daughters you left behind will fall by the sword."
Ezekiel,24,22,And you will do as I have done. You will not cover your mustache and beard or eat the customary food of mourners.
Ezekiel,24,23,You will keep your turbans on your heads and your sandals on your feet. You will not mourn or weep but will waste away because of your sins and groan among yourselves.
Ezekiel,24,24,"Ezekiel will be a sign to you; you will do just as he has done. When this happens, you will know that I am the Sovereign LORD.’"
Ezekiel,24,25,"“And you, son of man, on the day I take away their stronghold, their joy and glory, the delight of their eyes, their heart’s desire, and their sons and daughters as well—"
Ezekiel,24,26,on that day a fugitive will come to tell you the news.
Ezekiel,24,27,"At that time your mouth will be opened; you will speak with him and will no longer be silent. So you will be a sign to them, and they will know that I am the LORD.”"
Ezekiel,25,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,25,2,"“Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites and prophesy against them."
Ezekiel,25,3,"Say to them, ‘Hear the word of the Sovereign LORD. This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because you said “Aha!” over my sanctuary when it was desecrated and over the land of Israel when it was laid waste and over the people of Judah when they went into exile,"
Ezekiel,25,4,therefore I am going to give you to the people of the East as a possession. They will set up their camps and pitch their tents among you; they will eat your fruit and drink your milk.
Ezekiel,25,5,I will turn Rabbah into a pasture for camels and Ammon into a resting place for sheep. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel,25,6,"For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because you have clapped your hands and stamped your feet, rejoicing with all the malice of your heart against the land of Israel,"
Ezekiel,25,7,"therefore I will stretch out my hand against you and give you as plunder to the nations. I will wipe you out from among the nations and exterminate you from the countries. I will destroy you, and you will know that I am the LORD.’”"
Ezekiel,25,8,"“This is what the Sovereign LORD says: ‘Because Moab and Seir said, “Look, Judah has become like all the other nations,”"
Ezekiel,25,9,"therefore I will expose the flank of Moab, beginning at its frontier towns—Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon and Kiriathaim—the glory of that land."
Ezekiel,25,10,"I will give Moab along with the Ammonites to the people of the East as a possession, so that the Ammonites will not be remembered among the nations;"
Ezekiel,25,11,and I will inflict punishment on Moab. Then they will know that I am the LORD.’”
Ezekiel,25,12,"“This is what the Sovereign LORD says: ‘Because Edom took revenge on Judah and became very guilty by doing so,"
Ezekiel,25,13,"therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will stretch out my hand against Edom and kill both man and beast. I will lay it waste, and from Teman to Dedan they will fall by the sword."
Ezekiel,25,14,"I will take vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel, and they will deal with Edom in accordance with my anger and my wrath; they will know my vengeance, declares the Sovereign LORD.’”"
Ezekiel,25,15,"“This is what the Sovereign LORD says: ‘Because the Philistines acted in vengeance and took revenge with malice in their hearts, and with ancient hostility sought to destroy Judah,"
Ezekiel,25,16,"therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am about to stretch out my hand against the Philistines, and I will wipe out the Kerethites and destroy those remaining along the coast."
Ezekiel,25,17,"I will carry out great vengeance on them and punish them in my wrath. Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I take vengeance on them.’”"
Ezekiel,26,1,"In the eleventh month of the twelfth year, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:"
Ezekiel,26,2,"“Son of man, because Tyre has said of Jerusalem, ‘Aha! The gate to the nations is broken, and its doors have swung open to me; now that she lies in ruins I will prosper,’"
Ezekiel,26,3,"therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against you, Tyre, and I will bring many nations against you, like the sea casting up its waves."
Ezekiel,26,4,They will destroy the walls of Tyre and pull down her towers; I will scrape away her rubble and make her a bare rock.
Ezekiel,26,5,"Out in the sea she will become a place to spread fishnets, for I have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD. She will become plunder for the nations,"
Ezekiel,26,6,and her settlements on the mainland will be ravaged by the sword. Then they will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel,26,7,"“For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: From the north I am going to bring against Tyre Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses and chariots, with horsemen and a great army."
Ezekiel,26,8,"He will ravage your settlements on the mainland with the sword; he will set up siege works against you, build a ramp up to your walls and raise his shields against you."
Ezekiel,26,9,He will direct the blows of his battering rams against your walls and demolish your towers with his weapons.
Ezekiel,26,10,"His horses will be so many that they will cover you with dust. Your walls will tremble at the noise of the warhorses, wagons and chariots when he enters your gates as men enter a city whose walls have been broken through."
Ezekiel,26,11,"The hooves of his horses will trample all your streets; he will kill your people with the sword, and your strong pillars will fall to the ground."
Ezekiel,26,12,"They will plunder your wealth and loot your merchandise; they will break down your walls and demolish your fine houses and throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea."
Ezekiel,26,13,"I will put an end to your noisy songs, and the music of your harps will be heard no more."
Ezekiel,26,14,"I will make you a bare rock, and you will become a place to spread fishnets. You will never be rebuilt, for I the LORD have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,26,15,"“This is what the Sovereign LORD says to Tyre: Will not the coastlands tremble at the sound of your fall, when the wounded groan and the slaughter takes place in you?"
Ezekiel,26,16,"Then all the princes of the coast will step down from their thrones and lay aside their robes and take off their embroidered garments. Clothed with terror, they will sit on the ground, trembling every moment, appalled at you."
Ezekiel,26,17,"Then they will take up a lament concerning you and say to you: “‘How you are destroyed, city of renown, peopled by men of the sea! You were a power on the seas, you and your citizens; you put your terror on all who lived there."
Ezekiel,26,18,Now the coastlands tremble on the day of your fall; the islands in the sea are terrified at your collapse.’
Ezekiel,26,19,"“This is what the Sovereign LORD says: When I make you a desolate city, like cities no longer inhabited, and when I bring the ocean depths over you and its vast waters cover you,"
Ezekiel,26,20,"then I will bring you down with those who go down to the pit, to the people of long ago. I will make you dwell in the earth below, as in ancient ruins, with those who go down to the pit, and you will not return or take your place in the land of the living."
Ezekiel,26,21,"I will bring you to a horrible end and you will be no more. You will be sought, but you will never again be found, declares the Sovereign LORD.”"
Ezekiel,27,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,27,2,"“Son of man, take up a lament concerning Tyre."
Ezekiel,27,3,"Say to Tyre, situated at the gateway to the sea, merchant of peoples on many coasts, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: “‘You say, Tyre, “I am perfect in beauty.”"
Ezekiel,27,4,Your domain was on the high seas; your builders brought your beauty to perfection.
Ezekiel,27,5,They made all your timbers of juniper from Senir; they took a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you.
Ezekiel,27,6,"Of oaks from Bashan they made your oars; of cypress wood from the coasts of Cyprus they made your deck, adorned with ivory."
Ezekiel,27,7,Fine embroidered linen from Egypt was your sail and served as your banner; your awnings were of blue and purple from the coasts of Elishah.
Ezekiel,27,8,"Men of Sidon and Arvad were your oarsmen; your skilled men, Tyre, were aboard as your sailors."
Ezekiel,27,9,Veteran craftsmen of Byblos were on board as shipwrights to caulk your seams. All the ships of the sea and their sailors came alongside to trade for your wares.
Ezekiel,27,10,"“‘Men of Persia, Lydia and Put served as soldiers in your army. They hung their shields and helmets on your walls, bringing you splendor."
Ezekiel,27,11,Men of Arvad and Helek guarded your walls on every side; men of Gammad were in your towers. They hung their shields around your walls; they brought your beauty to perfection.
Ezekiel,27,12,"“‘Tarshish did business with you because of your great wealth of goods; they exchanged silver, iron, tin and lead for your merchandise."

Ezekiel,27,18,"“‘Damascus did business with you because of your many products and great wealth of goods. They offered wine from Helbon, wool from Zahar"

Ezekiel,27,24,"In your marketplace they traded with you beautiful garments, blue fabric, embroidered work and multicolored rugs with cords twisted and tightly knotted."
Ezekiel,27,25,“‘The ships of Tarshish serve as carriers for your wares. You are filled with heavy cargo as you sail the sea.
Ezekiel,27,26,Your oarsmen take you out to the high seas. But the east wind will break you to pieces far out at sea.
Ezekiel,27,27,"Your wealth, merchandise and wares, your mariners, sailors and shipwrights, your merchants and all your soldiers, and everyone else on board will sink into the heart of the sea on the day of your shipwreck."
Ezekiel,27,28,The shorelands will quake when your sailors cry out.
Ezekiel,27,29,All who handle the oars will abandon their ships; the mariners and all the sailors will stand on the shore.
Ezekiel,27,30,They will raise their voice and cry bitterly over you; they will sprinkle dust on their heads and roll in ashes.
Ezekiel,27,31,They will shave their heads because of you and will put on sackcloth. They will weep over you with anguish of soul and with bitter mourning.
Ezekiel,27,32,"As they wail and mourn over you, they will take up a lament concerning you: “Who was ever silenced like Tyre, surrounded by the sea?”"
Ezekiel,27,33,"When your merchandise went out on the seas, you satisfied many nations; with your great wealth and your wares you enriched the kings of the earth."
Ezekiel,27,34,Now you are shattered by the sea in the depths of the waters; your wares and all your company have gone down with you.
Ezekiel,27,35,All who live in the coastlands are appalled at you; their kings shudder with horror and their faces are distorted with fear.
Ezekiel,27,36,The merchants among the nations scoff at you; you have come to a horrible end and will be no more.’”
Ezekiel,28,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,28,2,"“Son of man, say to the ruler of Tyre, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: “‘In the pride of your heart you say, “I am a god; I sit on the throne of a god in the heart of the seas.” But you are a mere mortal and not a god, though you think you are as wise as a god."
Ezekiel,28,3,Are you wiser than Daniel? Is no secret hidden from you?
Ezekiel,28,4,By your wisdom and understanding you have gained wealth for yourself and amassed gold and silver in your treasuries.
Ezekiel,28,5,"By your great skill in trading you have increased your wealth, and because of your wealth your heart has grown proud."
Ezekiel,28,6,"“‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: “‘Because you think you are wise, as wise as a god,"
Ezekiel,28,7,"I am going to bring foreigners against you, the most ruthless of nations; they will draw their swords against your beauty and wisdom and pierce your shining splendor."
Ezekiel,28,8,"They will bring you down to the pit, and you will die a violent death in the heart of the seas."
Ezekiel,28,9,"Will you then say, “I am a god,” in the presence of those who kill you? You will be but a mortal, not a god, in the hands of those who slay you."
Ezekiel,28,10,"You will die the death of the uncircumcised at the hands of foreigners. I have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD.’”"
Ezekiel,28,11,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,28,12,"“Son of man, take up a lament concerning the king of Tyre and say to him: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: “‘You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty."
Ezekiel,28,13,"You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone adorned you: carnelian, chrysolite and emerald, topaz, onyx and jasper, lapis lazuli, turquoise and beryl. Your settings and mountings were made of gold; on the day you were created they were prepared."
Ezekiel,28,14,"You were anointed as a guardian cherub, for so I ordained you. You were on the holy mount of God; you walked among the fiery stones."
Ezekiel,28,15,You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created till wickedness was found in you.
Ezekiel,28,16,"Through your widespread trade you were filled with violence, and you sinned. So I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God, and I expelled you, guardian cherub, from among the fiery stones."
Ezekiel,28,17,"Your heart became proud on account of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. So I threw you to the earth; I made a spectacle of you before kings."
Ezekiel,28,18,"By your many sins and dishonest trade you have desecrated your sanctuaries. So I made a fire come out from you, and it consumed you, and I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the sight of all who were watching."
Ezekiel,28,19,All the nations who knew you are appalled at you; you have come to a horrible end and will be no more.’”
Ezekiel,28,20,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,28,21,"“Son of man, set your face against Sidon; prophesy against her"
Ezekiel,28,22,"and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: “‘I am against you, Sidon, and among you I will display my glory. You will know that I am the LORD, when I inflict punishment on you and within you am proved to be holy."

Ezekiel,29,1,"Judgment on Pharaoh In the tenth year, in the tenth month on the twelfth day, the word of the LORD came to me:"
Ezekiel,29,2,"“Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against him and against all Egypt."
Ezekiel,29,3,"Speak to him and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: “‘I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, you great monster lying among your streams. You say, “The Nile belongs to me; I made it for myself.”"
Ezekiel,29,4,"But I will put hooks in your jaws and make the fish of your streams stick to your scales. I will pull you out from among your streams, with all the fish sticking to your scales."
Ezekiel,29,5,"I will leave you in the desert, you and all the fish of your streams. You will fall on the open field and not be gathered or picked up. I will give you as food to the beasts of the earth and the birds of the sky."
Ezekiel,29,6,Then all who live in Egypt will know that I am the LORD. “‘You have been a staff of reed for the people of Israel.

Ezekiel,29,9,"Egypt will become a desolate wasteland. Then they will know that I am the LORD. “‘Because you said, “The Nile is mine; I made it,”"
Ezekiel,29,10,"therefore I am against you and against your streams, and I will make the land of Egypt a ruin and a desolate waste from Migdol to Aswan, as far as the border of Cush."
Ezekiel,29,11,The foot of neither man nor beast will pass through it; no one will live there for forty years.
Ezekiel,29,12,"I will make the land of Egypt desolate among devastated lands, and her cities will lie desolate forty years among ruined cities. And I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them through the countries."
Ezekiel,29,13,“‘Yet this is what the Sovereign LORD says: At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the nations where they were scattered.
Ezekiel,29,14,"I will bring them back from captivity and return them to Upper Egypt, the land of their ancestry. There they will be a lowly kingdom."
Ezekiel,29,15,It will be the lowliest of kingdoms and will never again exalt itself above the other nations. I will make it so weak that it will never again rule over the nations.
Ezekiel,29,16,Egypt will no longer be a source of confidence for the people of Israel but will be a reminder of their sin in turning to her for help. Then they will know that I am the Sovereign LORD.’”

Ezekiel,30,15,"I will pour out my wrath on Pelusium, the stronghold of Egypt, and wipe out the hordes of Thebes."
Ezekiel,30,16,I will set fire to Egypt; Pelusium will writhe in agony. Thebes will be taken by storm; Memphis will be in constant distress.
Ezekiel,30,17,"The young men of Heliopolis and Bubastis will fall by the sword, and the cities themselves will go into captivity."
Ezekiel,30,18,"Dark will be the day at Tahpanhes when I break the yoke of Egypt; there her proud strength will come to an end. She will be covered with clouds, and her villages will go into captivity."

Ezekiel,30,21,"“Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt. It has not been bound up to be healed or put in a splint so that it may become strong enough to hold a sword."
Ezekiel,30,22,"Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt. I will break both his arms, the good arm as well as the broken one, and make the sword fall from his hand."
Ezekiel,30,23,I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them through the countries.

Ezekiel,31,1,"Pharaoh as a Felled Cedar of Lebanon In the eleventh year, in the third month on the first day, the word of the LORD came to me:"
Ezekiel,31,2,"“Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his hordes: “‘Who can be compared with you in majesty?"
Ezekiel,31,3,"Consider Assyria, once a cedar in Lebanon, with beautiful branches overshadowing the forest; it towered on high, its top above the thick foliage."
Ezekiel,31,4,"The waters nourished it, deep springs made it grow tall; their streams flowed all around its base and sent their channels to all the trees of the field."
Ezekiel,31,5,"So it towered higher than all the trees of the field; its boughs increased and its branches grew long, spreading because of abundant waters."
Ezekiel,31,6,"All the birds of the sky nested in its boughs, all the animals of the wild gave birth under its branches; all the great nations lived in its shade."
Ezekiel,31,7,"It was majestic in beauty, with its spreading boughs, for its roots went down to abundant waters."
Ezekiel,31,8,"The cedars in the garden of God could not rival it, nor could the junipers equal its boughs, nor could the plane trees compare with its branches— no tree in the garden of God could match its beauty."
Ezekiel,31,9,"I made it beautiful with abundant branches, the envy of all the trees of Eden in the garden of God."
Ezekiel,31,10,"“‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because the great cedar towered over the thick foliage, and because it was proud of its height,"
Ezekiel,31,11,"I gave it into the hands of the ruler of the nations, for him to deal with according to its wickedness. I cast it aside,"
Ezekiel,31,12,and the most ruthless of foreign nations cut it down and left it. Its boughs fell on the mountains and in all the valleys; its branches lay broken in all the ravines of the land. All the nations of the earth came out from under its shade and left it.
Ezekiel,31,13,"All the birds settled on the fallen tree, and all the wild animals lived among its branches."
Ezekiel,31,14,"Therefore no other trees by the waters are ever to tower proudly on high, lifting their tops above the thick foliage. No other trees so well-watered are ever to reach such a height; they are all destined for death, for the earth below, among mortals who go down to the realm of the dead."
Ezekiel,31,15,"“‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: On the day it was brought down to the realm of the dead I covered the deep springs with mourning for it; I held back its streams, and its abundant waters were restrained. Because of it I clothed Lebanon with gloom, and all the trees of the field withered away."
Ezekiel,31,16,"I made the nations tremble at the sound of its fall when I brought it down to the realm of the dead to be with those who go down to the pit. Then all the trees of Eden, the choicest and best of Lebanon, the well-watered trees, were consoled in the earth below."
Ezekiel,31,17,"They too, like the great cedar, had gone down to the realm of the dead, to those killed by the sword, along with the armed men who lived in its shade among the nations."
Ezekiel,31,18,"“‘Which of the trees of Eden can be compared with you in splendor and majesty? Yet you, too, will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the earth below; you will lie among the uncircumcised, with those killed by the sword. “‘This is Pharaoh and all his hordes, declares the Sovereign LORD.’”"
Ezekiel,32,1,"A Lament Over Pharaoh In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month on the first day, the word of the LORD came to me:"
Ezekiel,32,2,"“Son of man, take up a lament concerning Pharaoh king of Egypt and say to him: “‘You are like a lion among the nations; you are like a monster in the seas thrashing about in your streams, churning the water with your feet and muddying the streams."
Ezekiel,32,3,"“‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: “‘With a great throng of people I will cast my net over you, and they will haul you up in my net."
Ezekiel,32,4,I will throw you on the land and hurl you on the open field. I will let all the birds of the sky settle on you and all the animals of the wild gorge themselves on you.
Ezekiel,32,5,I will spread your flesh on the mountains and fill the valleys with your remains.
Ezekiel,32,6,"I will drench the land with your flowing blood all the way to the mountains, and the ravines will be filled with your flesh."
Ezekiel,32,7,"When I snuff you out, I will cover the heavens and darken their stars; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon will not give its light."
Ezekiel,32,8,"All the shining lights in the heavens I will darken over you; I will bring darkness over your land, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,32,9,"I will trouble the hearts of many peoples when I bring about your destruction among the nations, among lands you have not known."
Ezekiel,32,10,"I will cause many peoples to be appalled at you, and their kings will shudder with horror because of you when I brandish my sword before them. On the day of your downfall each of them will tremble every moment for his life."
Ezekiel,32,11,“‘For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: “‘The sword of the king of Babylon will come against you.
Ezekiel,32,12,"I will cause your hordes to fall by the swords of mighty men— the most ruthless of all nations. They will shatter the pride of Egypt, and all her hordes will be overthrown."
Ezekiel,32,13,I will destroy all her cattle from beside abundant waters no longer to be stirred by the foot of man or muddied by the hooves of cattle.
Ezekiel,32,14,"Then I will let her waters settle and make her streams flow like oil, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,32,15,"When I make Egypt desolate and strip the land of everything in it, when I strike down all who live there, then they will know that I am the LORD.’"
Ezekiel,32,16,"“This is the lament they will chant for her. The daughters of the nations will chant it; for Egypt and all her hordes they will chant it, declares the Sovereign LORD.”"
Ezekiel,32,17,"Egypt’s Descent Into the Realm of the Dead In the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:"
Ezekiel,32,18,"“Son of man, wail for the hordes of Egypt and consign to the earth below both her and the daughters of mighty nations, along with those who go down to the pit."
Ezekiel,32,19,"Say to them, ‘Are you more favored than others? Go down and be laid among the uncircumcised.’"
Ezekiel,32,20,They will fall among those killed by the sword. The sword is drawn; let her be dragged off with all her hordes.
Ezekiel,32,21,"From within the realm of the dead the mighty leaders will say of Egypt and her allies, ‘They have come down and they lie with the uncircumcised, with those killed by the sword.’"
Ezekiel,32,22,"“Assyria is there with her whole army; she is surrounded by the graves of all her slain, all who have fallen by the sword."
Ezekiel,32,23,"Their graves are in the depths of the pit and her army lies around her grave. All who had spread terror in the land of the living are slain, fallen by the sword."
Ezekiel,32,24,"“Elam is there, with all her hordes around her grave. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword. All who had spread terror in the land of the living went down uncircumcised to the earth below. They bear their shame with those who go down to the pit."
Ezekiel,32,25,"A bed is made for her among the slain, with all her hordes around her grave. All of them are uncircumcised, killed by the sword. Because their terror had spread in the land of the living, they bear their shame with those who go down to the pit; they are laid among the slain."
Ezekiel,32,26,"“Meshek and Tubal are there, with all their hordes around their graves. All of them are uncircumcised, killed by the sword because they spread their terror in the land of the living."
Ezekiel,32,27,"But they do not lie with the fallen warriors of old, who went down to the realm of the dead with their weapons of war—their swords placed under their heads and their shields resting on their bones—though these warriors also had terrorized the land of the living."
Ezekiel,32,28,"“You too, Pharaoh, will be broken and will lie among the uncircumcised, with those killed by the sword."
Ezekiel,32,29,"“Edom is there, her kings and all her princes; despite their power, they are laid with those killed by the sword. They lie with the uncircumcised, with those who go down to the pit."
Ezekiel,32,30,“All the princes of the north and all the Sidonians are there; they went down with the slain in disgrace despite the terror caused by their power. They lie uncircumcised with those killed by the sword and bear their shame with those who go down to the pit.
Ezekiel,32,31,"“Pharaoh—he and all his army—will see them and he will be consoled for all his hordes that were killed by the sword, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,32,32,"Although I had him spread terror in the land of the living, Pharaoh and all his hordes will be laid among the uncircumcised, with those killed by the sword, declares the Sovereign LORD.”"
Ezekiel,33,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,33,2,"“Son of man, speak to your people and say to them: ‘When I bring the sword against a land, and the people of the land choose one of their men and make him their watchman,"
Ezekiel,33,3,"and he sees the sword coming against the land and blows the trumpet to warn the people,"
Ezekiel,33,4,"then if anyone hears the trumpet but does not heed the warning and the sword comes and takes their life, their blood will be on their own head."
Ezekiel,33,5,"Since they heard the sound of the trumpet but did not heed the warning, their blood will be on their own head. If they had heeded the warning, they would have saved themselves."
Ezekiel,33,6,"But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet to warn the people and the sword comes and takes someone’s life, that person’s life will be taken because of their sin, but I will hold the watchman accountable for their blood.’"
Ezekiel,33,7,"“Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the people of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me."
Ezekiel,33,8,"When I say to the wicked, ‘You wicked person, you will surely die,’ and you do not speak out to dissuade them from their ways, that wicked person will die for their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood."
Ezekiel,33,9,"But if you do warn the wicked person to turn from their ways and they do not do so, they will die for their sin, though you yourself will be saved."
Ezekiel,33,10,"“Son of man, say to the Israelites, ‘This is what you are saying: “Our offenses and sins weigh us down, and we are wasting away because of them. How then can we live?”’"
Ezekiel,33,11,"Say to them, ‘As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, people of Israel?’"
Ezekiel,33,12,"“Therefore, son of man, say to your people, ‘If someone who is righteous disobeys, that person’s former righteousness will count for nothing. And if someone who is wicked repents, that person’s former wickedness will not bring condemnation. The righteous person who sins will not be allowed to live even though they were formerly righteous.’"
Ezekiel,33,13,"If I tell a righteous person that they will surely live, but then they trust in their righteousness and do evil, none of the righteous things that person has done will be remembered; they will die for the evil they have done."
Ezekiel,33,14,"And if I say to a wicked person, ‘You will surely die,’ but they then turn away from their sin and do what is just and right—"
Ezekiel,33,15,"if they give back what they took in pledge for a loan, return what they have stolen, follow the decrees that give life, and do no evil—that person will surely live; they will not die."
Ezekiel,33,16,None of the sins that person has committed will be remembered against them. They have done what is just and right; they will surely live.
Ezekiel,33,17,"“Yet your people say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ But it is their way that is not just."
Ezekiel,33,18,"If a righteous person turns from their righteousness and does evil, they will die for it."
Ezekiel,33,19,"And if a wicked person turns away from their wickedness and does what is just and right, they will live by doing so."
Ezekiel,33,20,"Yet you Israelites say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ But I will judge each of you according to your own ways.”"
Ezekiel,33,21,"In the twelfth year of our exile, in the tenth month on the fifth day, a man who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said, “The city has fallen!”"
Ezekiel,33,22,"Now the evening before the man arrived, the hand of the LORD was on me, and he opened my mouth before the man came to me in the morning. So my mouth was opened and I was no longer silent."
Ezekiel,33,23,Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,33,24,"“Son of man, the people living in those ruins in the land of Israel are saying, ‘Abraham was only one man, yet he possessed the land. But we are many; surely the land has been given to us as our possession.’"
Ezekiel,33,25,"Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Since you eat meat with the blood still in it and look to your idols and shed blood, should you then possess the land?"
Ezekiel,33,26,"You rely on your sword, you do detestable things, and each of you defiles his neighbor’s wife. Should you then possess the land?’"
Ezekiel,33,27,"“Say this to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: As surely as I live, those who are left in the ruins will fall by the sword, those out in the country I will give to the wild animals to be devoured, and those in strongholds and caves will die of a plague."
Ezekiel,33,28,"I will make the land a desolate waste, and her proud strength will come to an end, and the mountains of Israel will become desolate so that no one will cross them."
Ezekiel,33,29,"Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I have made the land a desolate waste because of all the detestable things they have done.’"
Ezekiel,33,30,"“As for you, son of man, your people are talking together about you by the walls and at the doors of the houses, saying to each other, ‘Come and hear the message that has come from the LORD.’"
Ezekiel,33,31,"My people come to you, as they usually do, and sit before you to hear your words, but they do not put them into practice. Their mouths speak of love, but their hearts are greedy for unjust gain."
Ezekiel,33,32,"Indeed, to them you are nothing more than one who sings love songs with a beautiful voice and plays an instrument well, for they hear your words but do not put them into practice."
Ezekiel,33,33,“When all this comes true—and it surely will—then they will know that a prophet has been among them.”
Ezekiel,34,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,34,2,"“Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy and say to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Woe to you shepherds of Israel who only take care of yourselves! Should not shepherds take care of the flock?"
Ezekiel,34,3,"You eat the curds, clothe yourselves with the wool and slaughter the choice animals, but you do not take care of the flock."
Ezekiel,34,4,You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured. You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost. You have ruled them harshly and brutally.
Ezekiel,34,5,"So they were scattered because there was no shepherd, and when they were scattered they became food for all the wild animals."
Ezekiel,34,6,"My sheep wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. They were scattered over the whole earth, and no one searched or looked for them."
Ezekiel,34,7,"“‘Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:"
Ezekiel,34,8,"As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, because my flock lacks a shepherd and so has been plundered and has become food for all the wild animals, and because my shepherds did not search for my flock but cared for themselves rather than for my flock,"
Ezekiel,34,9,"therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:"
Ezekiel,34,10,"This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against the shepherds and will hold them accountable for my flock. I will remove them from tending the flock so that the shepherds can no longer feed themselves. I will rescue my flock from their mouths, and it will no longer be food for them."
Ezekiel,34,11,“‘For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I myself will search for my sheep and look after them.
Ezekiel,34,12,"As a shepherd looks after his scattered flock when he is with them, so will I look after my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness."
Ezekiel,34,13,"I will bring them out from the nations and gather them from the countries, and I will bring them into their own land. I will pasture them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines and in all the settlements in the land."
Ezekiel,34,14,"I will tend them in a good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel will be their grazing land. There they will lie down in good grazing land, and there they will feed in a rich pasture on the mountains of Israel."
Ezekiel,34,15,"I myself will tend my sheep and have them lie down, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,34,16,"I will search for the lost and bring back the strays. I will bind up the injured and strengthen the weak, but the sleek and the strong I will destroy. I will shepherd the flock with justice."
Ezekiel,34,17,"“‘As for you, my flock, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will judge between one sheep and another, and between rams and goats."
Ezekiel,34,18,Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture? Must you also trample the rest of your pasture with your feet? Is it not enough for you to drink clear water? Must you also muddy the rest with your feet?
Ezekiel,34,19,Must my flock feed on what you have trampled and drink what you have muddied with your feet?
Ezekiel,34,20,"“‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says to them: See, I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep."
Ezekiel,34,21,"Because you shove with flank and shoulder, butting all the weak sheep with your horns until you have driven them away,"
Ezekiel,34,22,"I will save my flock, and they will no longer be plundered. I will judge between one sheep and another."
Ezekiel,34,23,"I will place over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he will tend them; he will tend them and be their shepherd."
Ezekiel,34,24,"I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David will be prince among them. I the LORD have spoken."
Ezekiel,34,25,“‘I will make a covenant of peace with them and rid the land of savage beasts so that they may live in the wilderness and sleep in the forests in safety.
Ezekiel,34,26,I will make them and the places surrounding my hill a blessing. I will send down showers in season; there will be showers of blessing.
Ezekiel,34,27,"The trees will yield their fruit and the ground will yield its crops; the people will be secure in their land. They will know that I am the LORD, when I break the bars of their yoke and rescue them from the hands of those who enslaved them."
Ezekiel,34,28,"They will no longer be plundered by the nations, nor will wild animals devour them. They will live in safety, and no one will make them afraid."
Ezekiel,34,29,"I will provide for them a land renowned for its crops, and they will no longer be victims of famine in the land or bear the scorn of the nations."
Ezekiel,34,30,"Then they will know that I, the LORD their God, am with them and that they, the Israelites, are my people, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,34,31,"You are my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, and I am your God, declares the Sovereign LORD.’”"
Ezekiel,35,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,35,2,"“Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir; prophesy against it"
Ezekiel,35,3,"and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you and make you a desolate waste."
Ezekiel,35,4,I will turn your towns into ruins and you will be desolate. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel,35,5,"“‘Because you harbored an ancient hostility and delivered the Israelites over to the sword at the time of their calamity, the time their punishment reached its climax,"
Ezekiel,35,6,"therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I will give you over to bloodshed and it will pursue you. Since you did not hate bloodshed, bloodshed will pursue you."
Ezekiel,35,7,I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste and cut off from it all who come and go.
Ezekiel,35,8,I will fill your mountains with the slain; those killed by the sword will fall on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines.
Ezekiel,35,9,I will make you desolate forever; your towns will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel,35,10,"“‘Because you have said, “These two nations and countries will be ours and we will take possession of them,” even though I the LORD was there,"
Ezekiel,35,11,"therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I will treat you in accordance with the anger and jealousy you showed in your hatred of them and I will make myself known among them when I judge you."
Ezekiel,35,12,"Then you will know that I the LORD have heard all the contemptible things you have said against the mountains of Israel. You said, “They have been laid waste and have been given over to us to devour.”"
Ezekiel,35,13,"You boasted against me and spoke against me without restraint, and I heard it."
Ezekiel,35,14,"This is what the Sovereign LORD says: While the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate."
Ezekiel,35,15,"Because you rejoiced when the inheritance of Israel became desolate, that is how I will treat you. You will be desolate, Mount Seir, you and all of Edom. Then they will know that I am the LORD.’”"
Ezekiel,36,1,"“Son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say, ‘Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD."
Ezekiel,36,2,"This is what the Sovereign LORD says: The enemy said of you, “Aha! The ancient heights have become our possession.”’"
Ezekiel,36,3,"Therefore prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because they ravaged and crushed you from every side so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations and the object of people’s malicious talk and slander,"
Ezekiel,36,4,"therefore, mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign LORD: This is what the Sovereign LORD says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, to the desolate ruins and the deserted towns that have been plundered and ridiculed by the rest of the nations around you—"
Ezekiel,36,5,"this is what the Sovereign LORD says: In my burning zeal I have spoken against the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, for with glee and with malice in their hearts they made my land their own possession so that they might plunder its pastureland.’"
Ezekiel,36,6,"Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel and say to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I speak in my jealous wrath because you have suffered the scorn of the nations."
Ezekiel,36,7,Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I swear with uplifted hand that the nations around you will also suffer scorn.
Ezekiel,36,8,"“‘But you, mountains of Israel, will produce branches and fruit for my people Israel, for they will soon come home."
Ezekiel,36,9,"I am concerned for you and will look on you with favor; you will be plowed and sown,"
Ezekiel,36,10,"and I will cause many people to live on you—yes, all of Israel. The towns will be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt."
Ezekiel,36,11,"I will increase the number of people and animals living on you, and they will be fruitful and become numerous. I will settle people on you as in the past and will make you prosper more than before. Then you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,36,12,"I will cause people, my people Israel, to live on you. They will possess you, and you will be their inheritance; you will never again deprive them of their children."
Ezekiel,36,13,"“‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because some say to you, “You devour people and deprive your nation of its children,”"
Ezekiel,36,14,"therefore you will no longer devour people or make your nation childless, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,36,15,"No longer will I make you hear the taunts of the nations, and no longer will you suffer the scorn of the peoples or cause your nation to fall, declares the Sovereign LORD.’”"
Ezekiel,36,16,Again the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,36,17,"“Son of man, when the people of Israel were living in their own land, they defiled it by their conduct and their actions. Their conduct was like a woman’s monthly uncleanness in my sight."
Ezekiel,36,18,So I poured out my wrath on them because they had shed blood in the land and because they had defiled it with their idols.
Ezekiel,36,19,"I dispersed them among the nations, and they were scattered through the countries; I judged them according to their conduct and their actions."
Ezekiel,36,20,"And wherever they went among the nations they profaned my holy name, for it was said of them, ‘These are the LORD’s people, and yet they had to leave his land.’"
Ezekiel,36,21,"I had concern for my holy name, which the people of Israel profaned among the nations where they had gone."
Ezekiel,36,22,"“Therefore say to the Israelites, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: It is not for your sake, people of Israel, that I am going to do these things, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you have gone."
Ezekiel,36,23,"I will show the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, the name you have profaned among them. Then the nations will know that I am the LORD, declares the Sovereign LORD, when I am proved holy through you before their eyes."
Ezekiel,36,24,“‘For I will take you out of the nations; I will gather you from all the countries and bring you back into your own land.
Ezekiel,36,25,"I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols."
Ezekiel,36,26,I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.
Ezekiel,36,27,And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.
Ezekiel,36,28,"Then you will live in the land I gave your ancestors; you will be my people, and I will be your God."
Ezekiel,36,29,I will save you from all your uncleanness. I will call for the grain and make it plentiful and will not bring famine upon you.
Ezekiel,36,30,"I will increase the fruit of the trees and the crops of the field, so that you will no longer suffer disgrace among the nations because of famine."
Ezekiel,36,31,"Then you will remember your evil ways and wicked deeds, and you will loathe yourselves for your sins and detestable practices."
Ezekiel,36,32,"I want you to know that I am not doing this for your sake, declares the Sovereign LORD. Be ashamed and disgraced for your conduct, people of Israel!"
Ezekiel,36,33,"“‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: On the day I cleanse you from all your sins, I will resettle your towns, and the ruins will be rebuilt."
Ezekiel,36,34,The desolate land will be cultivated instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass through it.
Ezekiel,36,35,"They will say, “This land that was laid waste has become like the garden of Eden; the cities that were lying in ruins, desolate and destroyed, are now fortified and inhabited.”"
Ezekiel,36,36,"Then the nations around you that remain will know that I the LORD have rebuilt what was destroyed and have replanted what was desolate. I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it.’"
Ezekiel,36,37,"“This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Once again I will yield to Israel’s plea and do this for them: I will make their people as numerous as sheep,"
Ezekiel,36,38,as numerous as the flocks for offerings at Jerusalem during her appointed festivals. So will the ruined cities be filled with flocks of people. Then they will know that I am the LORD.”
Ezekiel,37,1,"The hand of the LORD was on me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the LORD and set me in the middle of a valley; it was full of bones."
Ezekiel,37,2,"He led me back and forth among them, and I saw a great many bones on the floor of the valley, bones that were very dry."
Ezekiel,37,3,"He asked me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” I said, “Sovereign LORD, you alone know.”"
Ezekiel,37,4,"Then he said to me, “Prophesy to these bones and say to them, ‘Dry bones, hear the word of the LORD!"
Ezekiel,37,5,"This is what the Sovereign LORD says to these bones: I will make breath enter you, and you will come to life."
Ezekiel,37,6,"I will attach tendons to you and make flesh come upon you and cover you with skin; I will put breath in you, and you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the LORD.’”"
Ezekiel,37,7,"So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I was prophesying, there was a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bone to bone."
Ezekiel,37,8,"I looked, and tendons and flesh appeared on them and skin covered them, but there was no breath in them."
Ezekiel,37,9,"Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and say to it, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Come, breath, from the four winds and breathe into these slain, that they may live.’”"
Ezekiel,37,10,"So I prophesied as he commanded me, and breath entered them; they came to life and stood up on their feet—a vast army."
Ezekiel,37,11,"Then he said to me: “Son of man, these bones are the people of Israel. They say, ‘Our bones are dried up and our hope is gone; we are cut off.’"
Ezekiel,37,12,"Therefore prophesy and say to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: My people, I am going to open your graves and bring you up from them; I will bring you back to the land of Israel."
Ezekiel,37,13,"Then you, my people, will know that I am the LORD, when I open your graves and bring you up from them."
Ezekiel,37,14,"I will put my Spirit in you and you will live, and I will settle you in your own land. Then you will know that I the LORD have spoken, and I have done it, declares the LORD.’”"
Ezekiel,37,15,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,37,16,"“Son of man, take a stick of wood and write on it, ‘Belonging to Judah and the Israelites associated with him.’ Then take another stick of wood, and write on it, ‘Belonging to Joseph (that is, to Ephraim) and all the Israelites associated with him.’"
Ezekiel,37,17,Join them together into one stick so that they will become one in your hand.
Ezekiel,37,18,"“When your people ask you, ‘Won’t you tell us what you mean by this?’"
Ezekiel,37,19,"say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am going to take the stick of Joseph—which is in Ephraim’s hand—and of the Israelite tribes associated with him, and join it to Judah’s stick. I will make them into a single stick of wood, and they will become one in my hand.’"
Ezekiel,37,20,Hold before their eyes the sticks you have written on
Ezekiel,37,21,"and say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will take the Israelites out of the nations where they have gone. I will gather them from all around and bring them back into their own land."
Ezekiel,37,22,"I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel. There will be one king over all of them and they will never again be two nations or be divided into two kingdoms."
Ezekiel,37,23,"They will no longer defile themselves with their idols and vile images or with any of their offenses, for I will save them from all their sinful backsliding, and I will cleanse them. They will be my people, and I will be their God."
Ezekiel,37,24,"“‘My servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one shepherd. They will follow my laws and be careful to keep my decrees."
Ezekiel,37,25,"They will live in the land I gave to my servant Jacob, the land where your ancestors lived. They and their children and their children’s children will live there forever, and David my servant will be their prince forever."
Ezekiel,37,26,"I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant. I will establish them and increase their numbers, and I will put my sanctuary among them forever."
Ezekiel,37,27,"My dwelling place will be with them; I will be their God, and they will be my people."
Ezekiel,37,28,"Then the nations will know that I the LORD make Israel holy, when my sanctuary is among them forever.’”"
Ezekiel,38,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,38,2,"“Son of man, set your face against Gog, of the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshek and Tubal; prophesy against him"
Ezekiel,38,3,"and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against you, Gog, chief prince of Meshek and Tubal."
Ezekiel,38,4,"I will turn you around, put hooks in your jaws and bring you out with your whole army—your horses, your horsemen fully armed, and a great horde with large and small shields, all of them brandishing their swords."
Ezekiel,38,5,"Persia, Cush and Put will be with them, all with shields and helmets,"
Ezekiel,38,6,"also Gomer with all its troops, and Beth Togarmah from the far north with all its troops—the many nations with you."
Ezekiel,38,7,"“‘Get ready; be prepared, you and all the hordes gathered about you, and take command of them."
Ezekiel,38,8,"After many days you will be called to arms. In future years you will invade a land that has recovered from war, whose people were gathered from many nations to the mountains of Israel, which had long been desolate. They had been brought out from the nations, and now all of them live in safety."
Ezekiel,38,9,"You and all your troops and the many nations with you will go up, advancing like a storm; you will be like a cloud covering the land."
Ezekiel,38,10,“‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: On that day thoughts will come into your mind and you will devise an evil scheme.
Ezekiel,38,11,"You will say, “I will invade a land of unwalled villages; I will attack a peaceful and unsuspecting people—all of them living without walls and without gates and bars."
Ezekiel,38,12,"I will plunder and loot and turn my hand against the resettled ruins and the people gathered from the nations, rich in livestock and goods, living at the center of the land.”"
Ezekiel,38,13,"Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish and all her villages will say to you, “Have you come to plunder? Have you gathered your hordes to loot, to carry off silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods and to seize much plunder?”’"
Ezekiel,38,14,"“Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: In that day, when my people Israel are living in safety, will you not take notice of it?"
Ezekiel,38,15,"You will come from your place in the far north, you and many nations with you, all of them riding on horses, a great horde, a mighty army."
Ezekiel,38,16,"You will advance against my people Israel like a cloud that covers the land. In days to come, Gog, I will bring you against my land, so that the nations may know me when I am proved holy through you before their eyes."
Ezekiel,38,17,“‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: You are the one I spoke of in former days by my servants the prophets of Israel. At that time they prophesied for years that I would bring you against them.
Ezekiel,38,18,"This is what will happen in that day: When Gog attacks the land of Israel, my hot anger will be aroused, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,38,19,In my zeal and fiery wrath I declare that at that time there shall be a great earthquake in the land of Israel.
Ezekiel,38,20,"The fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the beasts of the field, every creature that moves along the ground, and all the people on the face of the earth will tremble at my presence. The mountains will be overturned, the cliffs will crumble and every wall will fall to the ground."
Ezekiel,38,21,"I will summon a sword against Gog on all my mountains, declares the Sovereign LORD. Every man’s sword will be against his brother."
Ezekiel,38,22,"I will execute judgment on him with plague and bloodshed; I will pour down torrents of rain, hailstones and burning sulfur on him and on his troops and on the many nations with him."
Ezekiel,38,23,"And so I will show my greatness and my holiness, and I will make myself known in the sight of many nations. Then they will know that I am the LORD.’"
Ezekiel,39,1,"“Son of man, prophesy against Gog and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against you, Gog, chief prince of Meshek and Tubal."
Ezekiel,39,2,I will turn you around and drag you along. I will bring you from the far north and send you against the mountains of Israel.
Ezekiel,39,3,Then I will strike your bow from your left hand and make your arrows drop from your right hand.
Ezekiel,39,4,"On the mountains of Israel you will fall, you and all your troops and the nations with you. I will give you as food to all kinds of carrion birds and to the wild animals."
Ezekiel,39,5,"You will fall in the open field, for I have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,39,6,"I will send fire on Magog and on those who live in safety in the coastlands, and they will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,39,7,"“‘I will make known my holy name among my people Israel. I will no longer let my holy name be profaned, and the nations will know that I the LORD am the Holy One in Israel."
Ezekiel,39,8,"It is coming! It will surely take place, declares the Sovereign LORD. This is the day I have spoken of."
Ezekiel,39,9,"“‘Then those who live in the towns of Israel will go out and use the weapons for fuel and burn them up—the small and large shields, the bows and arrows, the war clubs and spears. For seven years they will use them for fuel."
Ezekiel,39,10,"They will not need to gather wood from the fields or cut it from the forests, because they will use the weapons for fuel. And they will plunder those who plundered them and loot those who looted them, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,39,11,"“‘On that day I will give Gog a burial place in Israel, in the valley of those who travel east of the Sea. It will block the way of travelers, because Gog and all his hordes will be buried there. So it will be called the Valley of Hamon Gog."
Ezekiel,39,12,“‘For seven months the Israelites will be burying them in order to cleanse the land.
Ezekiel,39,13,"All the people of the land will bury them, and the day I display my glory will be a memorable day for them, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,39,14,"People will be continually employed in cleansing the land. They will spread out across the land and, along with others, they will bury any bodies that are lying on the ground. “‘After the seven months they will carry out a more detailed search."
Ezekiel,39,15,"As they go through the land, anyone who sees a human bone will leave a marker beside it until the gravediggers bury it in the Valley of Hamon Gog,"
Ezekiel,39,16,near a town called Hamonah. And so they will cleanse the land.’
Ezekiel,39,17,"“Son of man, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Call out to every kind of bird and all the wild animals: ‘Assemble and come together from all around to the sacrifice I am preparing for you, the great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel. There you will eat flesh and drink blood."
Ezekiel,39,18,"You will eat the flesh of mighty men and drink the blood of the princes of the earth as if they were rams and lambs, goats and bulls—all of them fattened animals from Bashan."
Ezekiel,39,19,"At the sacrifice I am preparing for you, you will eat fat till you are glutted and drink blood till you are drunk."
Ezekiel,39,20,"At my table you will eat your fill of horses and riders, mighty men and soldiers of every kind,’ declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,39,21,"“I will display my glory among the nations, and all the nations will see the punishment I inflict and the hand I lay on them."
Ezekiel,39,22,From that day forward the people of Israel will know that I am the LORD their God.
Ezekiel,39,23,"And the nations will know that the people of Israel went into exile for their sin, because they were unfaithful to me. So I hid my face from them and handed them over to their enemies, and they all fell by the sword."
Ezekiel,39,24,"I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and their offenses, and I hid my face from them."
Ezekiel,39,25,"“Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will now restore the fortunes of Jacob and will have compassion on all the people of Israel, and I will be zealous for my holy name."
Ezekiel,39,26,They will forget their shame and all the unfaithfulness they showed toward me when they lived in safety in their land with no one to make them afraid.
Ezekiel,39,27,"When I have brought them back from the nations and have gathered them from the countries of their enemies, I will be proved holy through them in the sight of many nations."
Ezekiel,39,28,"Then they will know that I am the LORD their God, for though I sent them into exile among the nations, I will gather them to their own land, not leaving any behind."
Ezekiel,39,29,"I will no longer hide my face from them, for I will pour out my Spirit on the people of Israel, declares the Sovereign LORD.”"
Ezekiel,40,1,"In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after the fall of the city—on that very day the hand of the LORD was on me and he took me there."
Ezekiel,40,2,"In visions of God he took me to the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain, on whose south side were some buildings that looked like a city."
Ezekiel,40,3,"He took me there, and I saw a man whose appearance was like bronze; he was standing in the gateway with a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand."
Ezekiel,40,4,"The man said to me, “Son of man, look carefully and listen closely and pay attention to everything I am going to show you, for that is why you have been brought here. Tell the people of Israel everything you see.”"
Ezekiel,40,5,"The East Gate to the Outer Court I saw a wall completely surrounding the temple area. The length of the measuring rod in the man’s hand was six long cubits, each of which was a cubit and a handbreadth. He measured the wall; it was one measuring rod thick and one rod high."
Ezekiel,40,6,Then he went to the east gate. He climbed its steps and measured the threshold of the gate; it was one rod deep.
Ezekiel,40,7,"The alcoves for the guards were one rod long and one rod wide, and the projecting walls between the alcoves were five cubits thick. And the threshold of the gate next to the portico facing the temple was one rod deep."
Ezekiel,40,8,Then he measured the portico of the gateway;
Ezekiel,40,9,it was eight cubits deep and its jambs were two cubits thick. The portico of the gateway faced the temple.
Ezekiel,40,10,"Inside the east gate were three alcoves on each side; the three had the same measurements, and the faces of the projecting walls on each side had the same measurements."
Ezekiel,40,11,Then he measured the width of the entrance of the gateway; it was ten cubits and its length was thirteen cubits.
Ezekiel,40,12,"In front of each alcove was a wall one cubit high, and the alcoves were six cubits square."
Ezekiel,40,13,Then he measured the gateway from the top of the rear wall of one alcove to the top of the opposite one; the distance was twenty-five cubits from one parapet opening to the opposite one.
Ezekiel,40,14,He measured along the faces of the projecting walls all around the inside of the gateway—sixty cubits. The measurement was up to the portico facing the courtyard.
Ezekiel,40,15,The distance from the entrance of the gateway to the far end of its portico was fifty cubits.
Ezekiel,40,16,"The alcoves and the projecting walls inside the gateway were surmounted by narrow parapet openings all around, as was the portico; the openings all around faced inward. The faces of the projecting walls were decorated with palm trees."
Ezekiel,40,17,The Outer Court Then he brought me into the outer court. There I saw some rooms and a pavement that had been constructed all around the court; there were thirty rooms along the pavement.
Ezekiel,40,18,It abutted the sides of the gateways and was as wide as they were long; this was the lower pavement.
Ezekiel,40,19,Then he measured the distance from the inside of the lower gateway to the outside of the inner court; it was a hundred cubits on the east side as well as on the north.
Ezekiel,40,20,"The North Gate Then he measured the length and width of the north gate, leading into the outer court."
Ezekiel,40,21,Its alcoves—three on each side—its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as those of the first gateway. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.
Ezekiel,40,22,"Its openings, its portico and its palm tree decorations had the same measurements as those of the gate facing east. Seven steps led up to it, with its portico opposite them."
Ezekiel,40,23,"There was a gate to the inner court facing the north gate, just as there was on the east. He measured from one gate to the opposite one; it was a hundred cubits."
Ezekiel,40,24,"The South Gate Then he led me to the south side and I saw the south gate. He measured its jambs and its portico, and they had the same measurements as the others."
Ezekiel,40,25,"The gateway and its portico had narrow openings all around, like the openings of the others. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide."
Ezekiel,40,26,"Seven steps led up to it, with its portico opposite them; it had palm tree decorations on the faces of the projecting walls on each side."
Ezekiel,40,27,"The inner court also had a gate facing south, and he measured from this gate to the outer gate on the south side; it was a hundred cubits."
Ezekiel,40,28,"The Gates to the Inner Court Then he brought me into the inner court through the south gate, and he measured the south gate; it had the same measurements as the others."
Ezekiel,40,29,"Its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as the others. The gateway and its portico had openings all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide."
Ezekiel,40,30,(The porticoes of the gateways around the inner court were twenty-five cubits wide and five cubits deep.)
Ezekiel,40,31,"Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated its jambs, and eight steps led up to it."
Ezekiel,40,32,"Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured the gateway; it had the same measurements as the others."
Ezekiel,40,33,"Its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as the others. The gateway and its portico had openings all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide."
Ezekiel,40,34,"Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated the jambs on either side, and eight steps led up to it."
Ezekiel,40,35,"Then he brought me to the north gate and measured it. It had the same measurements as the others,"
Ezekiel,40,36,"as did its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico, and it had openings all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide."
Ezekiel,40,37,"Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated the jambs on either side, and eight steps led up to it."
Ezekiel,40,38,"The Rooms for Preparing Sacrifices A room with a doorway was by the portico in each of the inner gateways, where the burnt offerings were washed."
Ezekiel,40,39,"In the portico of the gateway were two tables on each side, on which the burnt offerings, sin offerings and guilt offerings were slaughtered."
Ezekiel,40,40,"By the outside wall of the portico of the gateway, near the steps at the entrance of the north gateway were two tables, and on the other side of the steps were two tables."
Ezekiel,40,41,So there were four tables on one side of the gateway and four on the other—eight tables in all—on which the sacrifices were slaughtered.
Ezekiel,40,42,"There were also four tables of dressed stone for the burnt offerings, each a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide and a cubit high. On them were placed the utensils for slaughtering the burnt offerings and the other sacrifices."
Ezekiel,40,43,"And double-pronged hooks, each a handbreadth long, were attached to the wall all around. The tables were for the flesh of the offerings."
Ezekiel,40,44,"The Rooms for the Priests Outside the inner gate, within the inner court, were two rooms, one at the side of the north gate and facing south, and another at the side of the south gate and facing north."
Ezekiel,40,45,"He said to me, “The room facing south is for the priests who guard the temple,"
Ezekiel,40,46,"and the room facing north is for the priests who guard the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who are the only Levites who may draw near to the LORD to minister before him.”"
Ezekiel,40,47,Then he measured the court: It was square—a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide. And the altar was in front of the temple.
Ezekiel,40,48,He brought me to the portico of the temple and measured the jambs of the portico; they were five cubits wide on either side. The width of the entrance was fourteen cubits and its projecting walls were three cubits wide on either side.
Ezekiel,40,49,"The portico was twenty cubits wide, and twelve cubits from front to back. It was reached by a flight of stairs, and there were pillars on each side of the jambs."
Ezekiel,41,1,Then the man brought me to the main hall and measured the jambs; the width of the jambs was six cubits on each side.
Ezekiel,41,2,"The entrance was ten cubits wide, and the projecting walls on each side of it were five cubits wide. He also measured the main hall; it was forty cubits long and twenty cubits wide."
Ezekiel,41,3,"Then he went into the inner sanctuary and measured the jambs of the entrance; each was two cubits wide. The entrance was six cubits wide, and the projecting walls on each side of it were seven cubits wide."
Ezekiel,41,4,"And he measured the length of the inner sanctuary; it was twenty cubits, and its width was twenty cubits across the end of the main hall. He said to me, “This is the Most Holy Place.”"
Ezekiel,41,5,"Then he measured the wall of the temple; it was six cubits thick, and each side room around the temple was four cubits wide."
Ezekiel,41,6,"The side rooms were on three levels, one above another, thirty on each level. There were ledges all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for the side rooms, so that the supports were not inserted into the wall of the temple."
Ezekiel,41,7,"The side rooms all around the temple were wider at each successive level. The structure surrounding the temple was built in ascending stages, so that the rooms widened as one went upward. A stairway went up from the lowest floor to the top floor through the middle floor."
Ezekiel,41,8,"I saw that the temple had a raised base all around it, forming the foundation of the side rooms. It was the length of the rod, six long cubits."
Ezekiel,41,9,The outer wall of the side rooms was five cubits thick. The open area between the side rooms of the temple
Ezekiel,41,10,and the priests’ rooms was twenty cubits wide all around the temple.
Ezekiel,41,11,"There were entrances to the side rooms from the open area, one on the north and another on the south; and the base adjoining the open area was five cubits wide all around."
Ezekiel,41,12,"The building facing the temple courtyard on the west side was seventy cubits wide. The wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length was ninety cubits."
Ezekiel,41,13,"Then he measured the temple; it was a hundred cubits long, and the temple courtyard and the building with its walls were also a hundred cubits long."
Ezekiel,41,14,"The width of the temple courtyard on the east, including the front of the temple, was a hundred cubits."
Ezekiel,41,15,"Then he measured the length of the building facing the courtyard at the rear of the temple, including its galleries on each side; it was a hundred cubits. The main hall, the inner sanctuary and the portico facing the court,"
Ezekiel,41,16,"as well as the thresholds and the narrow windows and galleries around the three of them—everything beyond and including the threshold was covered with wood. The floor, the wall up to the windows, and the windows were covered."
Ezekiel,41,17,In the space above the outside of the entrance to the inner sanctuary and on the walls at regular intervals all around the inner and outer sanctuary
Ezekiel,41,18,were carved cherubim and palm trees. Palm trees alternated with cherubim. Each cherub had two faces:
Ezekiel,41,19,the face of a human being toward the palm tree on one side and the face of a lion toward the palm tree on the other. They were carved all around the whole temple.
Ezekiel,41,20,"From the floor to the area above the entrance, cherubim and palm trees were carved on the wall of the main hall."
Ezekiel,41,21,"The main hall had a rectangular doorframe, and the one at the front of the Most Holy Place was similar."
Ezekiel,41,22,"There was a wooden altar three cubits high and two cubits square; its corners, its base and its sides were of wood. The man said to me, “This is the table that is before the LORD.”"
Ezekiel,41,23,Both the main hall and the Most Holy Place had double doors.
Ezekiel,41,24,Each door had two leaves—two hinged leaves for each door.
Ezekiel,41,25,"And on the doors of the main hall were carved cherubim and palm trees like those carved on the walls, and there was a wooden overhang on the front of the portico."
Ezekiel,41,26,On the sidewalls of the portico were narrow windows with palm trees carved on each side. The side rooms of the temple also had overhangs.
Ezekiel,42,1,Then the man led me northward into the outer court and brought me to the rooms opposite the temple courtyard and opposite the outer wall on the north side.
Ezekiel,42,2,The building whose door faced north was a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide.
Ezekiel,42,3,"Both in the section twenty cubits from the inner court and in the section opposite the pavement of the outer court, gallery faced gallery at the three levels."
Ezekiel,42,4,In front of the rooms was an inner passageway ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits long. Their doors were on the north.
Ezekiel,42,5,"Now the upper rooms were narrower, for the galleries took more space from them than from the rooms on the lower and middle floors of the building."
Ezekiel,42,6,"The rooms on the top floor had no pillars, as the courts had; so they were smaller in floor space than those on the lower and middle floors."
Ezekiel,42,7,There was an outer wall parallel to the rooms and the outer court; it extended in front of the rooms for fifty cubits.
Ezekiel,42,8,"While the row of rooms on the side next to the outer court was fifty cubits long, the row on the side nearest the sanctuary was a hundred cubits long."
Ezekiel,42,9,The lower rooms had an entrance on the east side as one enters them from the outer court.
Ezekiel,42,10,"On the south side along the length of the wall of the outer court, adjoining the temple courtyard and opposite the outer wall, were rooms"
Ezekiel,42,11,"with a passageway in front of them. These were like the rooms on the north; they had the same length and width, with similar exits and dimensions. Similar to the doorways on the north"
Ezekiel,42,12,"were the doorways of the rooms on the south. There was a doorway at the beginning of the passageway that was parallel to the corresponding wall extending eastward, by which one enters the rooms."
Ezekiel,42,13,"Then he said to me, “The north and south rooms facing the temple courtyard are the priests’ rooms, where the priests who approach the LORD will eat the most holy offerings. There they will put the most holy offerings—the grain offerings, the sin offerings and the guilt offerings—for the place is holy."
Ezekiel,42,14,"Once the priests enter the holy precincts, they are not to go into the outer court until they leave behind the garments in which they minister, for these are holy. They are to put on other clothes before they go near the places that are for the people.”"
Ezekiel,42,15,"When he had finished measuring what was inside the temple area, he led me out by the east gate and measured the area all around:"
Ezekiel,42,16,He measured the east side with the measuring rod; it was five hundred cubits.
Ezekiel,42,17,He measured the north side; it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.
Ezekiel,42,18,He measured the south side; it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.
Ezekiel,42,19,Then he turned to the west side and measured; it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.
Ezekiel,42,20,"So he measured the area on all four sides. It had a wall around it, five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits wide, to separate the holy from the common."
Ezekiel,43,1,"Then the man brought me to the gate facing east,"
Ezekiel,43,2,"and I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east. His voice was like the roar of rushing waters, and the land was radiant with his glory."
Ezekiel,43,3,"The vision I saw was like the vision I had seen when he came to destroy the city and like the visions I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell facedown."
Ezekiel,43,4,The glory of the LORD entered the temple through the gate facing east.
Ezekiel,43,5,"Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court, and the glory of the LORD filled the temple."
Ezekiel,43,6,"While the man was standing beside me, I heard someone speaking to me from inside the temple."
Ezekiel,43,7,"He said: “Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet. This is where I will live among the Israelites forever. The people of Israel will never again defile my holy name—neither they nor their kings—by their prostitution and the funeral offerings for their kings at their death."
Ezekiel,43,8,"When they placed their threshold next to my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them, they defiled my holy name by their detestable practices. So I destroyed them in my anger."
Ezekiel,43,9,"Now let them put away from me their prostitution and the funeral offerings for their kings, and I will live among them forever."
Ezekiel,43,10,"“Son of man, describe the temple to the people of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their sins. Let them consider its perfection,"
Ezekiel,43,11,"and if they are ashamed of all they have done, make known to them the design of the temple—its arrangement, its exits and entrances—its whole design and all its regulations and laws. Write these down before them so that they may be faithful to its design and follow all its regulations."
Ezekiel,43,12,“This is the law of the temple: All the surrounding area on top of the mountain will be most holy. Such is the law of the temple.
Ezekiel,43,13,"“These are the measurements of the altar in long cubits, that cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth: Its gutter is a cubit deep and a cubit wide, with a rim of one span around the edge. And this is the height of the altar:"
Ezekiel,43,14,"From the gutter on the ground up to the lower ledge that goes around the altar it is two cubits high, and the ledge is a cubit wide. From this lower ledge to the upper ledge that goes around the altar it is four cubits high, and that ledge is also a cubit wide."
Ezekiel,43,15,"Above that, the altar hearth is four cubits high, and four horns project upward from the hearth."
Ezekiel,43,16,"The altar hearth is square, twelve cubits long and twelve cubits wide."
Ezekiel,43,17,"The upper ledge also is square, fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits wide. All around the altar is a gutter of one cubit with a rim of half a cubit. The steps of the altar face east.”"
Ezekiel,43,18,"Then he said to me, “Son of man, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: These will be the regulations for sacrificing burnt offerings and splashing blood against the altar when it is built:"
Ezekiel,43,19,"You are to give a young bull as a sin offering to the Levitical priests of the family of Zadok, who come near to minister before me, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,43,20,"You are to take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar and on the four corners of the upper ledge and all around the rim, and so purify the altar and make atonement for it."
Ezekiel,43,21,You are to take the bull for the sin offering and burn it in the designated part of the temple area outside the sanctuary.
Ezekiel,43,22,"“On the second day you are to offer a male goat without defect for a sin offering, and the altar is to be purified as it was purified with the bull."
Ezekiel,43,23,"When you have finished purifying it, you are to offer a young bull and a ram from the flock, both without defect."
Ezekiel,43,24,"You are to offer them before the LORD, and the priests are to sprinkle salt on them and sacrifice them as a burnt offering to the LORD."
Ezekiel,43,25,"“For seven days you are to provide a male goat daily for a sin offering; you are also to provide a young bull and a ram from the flock, both without defect."
Ezekiel,43,26,For seven days they are to make atonement for the altar and cleanse it; thus they will dedicate it.
Ezekiel,43,27,"At the end of these days, from the eighth day on, the priests are to present your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar. Then I will accept you, declares the Sovereign LORD.”"
Ezekiel,44,1,"Then the man brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary, the one facing east, and it was shut."
Ezekiel,44,2,"The LORD said to me, “This gate is to remain shut. It must not be opened; no one may enter through it. It is to remain shut because the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered through it."
Ezekiel,44,3,The prince himself is the only one who may sit inside the gateway to eat in the presence of the LORD. He is to enter by way of the portico of the gateway and go out the same way.”
Ezekiel,44,4,"Then the man brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple. I looked and saw the glory of the LORD filling the temple of the LORD, and I fell facedown."
Ezekiel,44,5,"The LORD said to me, “Son of man, look carefully, listen closely and give attention to everything I tell you concerning all the regulations and instructions regarding the temple of the LORD. Give attention to the entrance to the temple and all the exits of the sanctuary."
Ezekiel,44,6,"Say to rebellious Israel, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Enough of your detestable practices, people of Israel!"
Ezekiel,44,7,"In addition to all your other detestable practices, you brought foreigners uncircumcised in heart and flesh into my sanctuary, desecrating my temple while you offered me food, fat and blood, and you broke my covenant."
Ezekiel,44,8,"Instead of carrying out your duty in regard to my holy things, you put others in charge of my sanctuary."
Ezekiel,44,9,"This is what the Sovereign LORD says: No foreigner uncircumcised in heart and flesh is to enter my sanctuary, not even the foreigners who live among the Israelites."
Ezekiel,44,10,“‘The Levites who went far from me when Israel went astray and who wandered from me after their idols must bear the consequences of their sin.
Ezekiel,44,11,"They may serve in my sanctuary, having charge of the gates of the temple and serving in it; they may slaughter the burnt offerings and sacrifices for the people and stand before the people and serve them."
Ezekiel,44,12,"But because they served them in the presence of their idols and made the people of Israel fall into sin, therefore I have sworn with uplifted hand that they must bear the consequences of their sin, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,44,13,They are not to come near to serve me as priests or come near any of my holy things or my most holy offerings; they must bear the shame of their detestable practices.
Ezekiel,44,14,And I will appoint them to guard the temple for all the work that is to be done in it.
Ezekiel,44,15,"“‘But the Levitical priests, who are descendants of Zadok and who guarded my sanctuary when the Israelites went astray from me, are to come near to minister before me; they are to stand before me to offer sacrifices of fat and blood, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,44,16,They alone are to enter my sanctuary; they alone are to come near my table to minister before me and serve me as guards.
Ezekiel,44,17,"“‘When they enter the gates of the inner court, they are to wear linen clothes; they must not wear any woolen garment while ministering at the gates of the inner court or inside the temple."
Ezekiel,44,18,They are to wear linen turbans on their heads and linen undergarments around their waists. They must not wear anything that makes them perspire.
Ezekiel,44,19,"When they go out into the outer court where the people are, they are to take off the clothes they have been ministering in and are to leave them in the sacred rooms, and put on other clothes, so that the people are not consecrated through contact with their garments."
Ezekiel,44,20,"“‘They must not shave their heads or let their hair grow long, but they are to keep the hair of their heads trimmed."
Ezekiel,44,21,No priest is to drink wine when he enters the inner court.
Ezekiel,44,22,They must not marry widows or divorced women; they may marry only virgins of Israelite descent or widows of priests.
Ezekiel,44,23,They are to teach my people the difference between the holy and the common and show them how to distinguish between the unclean and the clean.
Ezekiel,44,24,"“‘In any dispute, the priests are to serve as judges and decide it according to my ordinances. They are to keep my laws and my decrees for all my appointed festivals, and they are to keep my Sabbaths holy."
Ezekiel,44,25,"“‘A priest must not defile himself by going near a dead person; however, if the dead person was his father or mother, son or daughter, brother or unmarried sister, then he may defile himself."
Ezekiel,44,26,"After he is cleansed, he must wait seven days."
Ezekiel,44,27,"On the day he goes into the inner court of the sanctuary to minister in the sanctuary, he is to offer a sin offering for himself, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,44,28,“‘I am to be the only inheritance the priests have. You are to give them no possession in Israel; I will be their possession.
Ezekiel,44,29,"They will eat the grain offerings, the sin offerings and the guilt offerings; and everything in Israel devoted to the LORD will belong to them."
Ezekiel,44,30,The best of all the firstfruits and of all your special gifts will belong to the priests. You are to give them the first portion of your ground meal so that a blessing may rest on your household.
Ezekiel,44,31,"The priests must not eat anything, whether bird or animal, found dead or torn by wild animals."
Ezekiel,45,1,"“‘When you allot the land as an inheritance, you are to present to the LORD a portion of the land as a sacred district, 25,000 cubits long and 20,000 cubits wide; the entire area will be holy."
Ezekiel,45,2,"Of this, a section 500 cubits square is to be for the sanctuary, with 50 cubits around it for open land."
Ezekiel,45,3,"In the sacred district, measure off a section 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide. In it will be the sanctuary, the Most Holy Place."
Ezekiel,45,4,"It will be the sacred portion of the land for the priests, who minister in the sanctuary and who draw near to minister before the LORD. It will be a place for their houses as well as a holy place for the sanctuary."
Ezekiel,45,5,"An area 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide will belong to the Levites, who serve in the temple, as their possession for towns to live in."
Ezekiel,45,6,"“‘You are to give the city as its property an area 5,000 cubits wide and 25,000 cubits long, adjoining the sacred portion; it will belong to all Israel."
Ezekiel,45,7,"“‘The prince will have the land bordering each side of the area formed by the sacred district and the property of the city. It will extend westward from the west side and eastward from the east side, running lengthwise from the western to the eastern border parallel to one of the tribal portions."
Ezekiel,45,8,This land will be his possession in Israel. And my princes will no longer oppress my people but will allow the people of Israel to possess the land according to their tribes.
Ezekiel,45,9,"“‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: You have gone far enough, princes of Israel! Give up your violence and oppression and do what is just and right. Stop dispossessing my people, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,45,10,"You are to use accurate scales, an accurate ephah and an accurate bath."
Ezekiel,45,11,"The ephah and the bath are to be the same size, the bath containing a tenth of a homer and the ephah a tenth of a homer; the homer is to be the standard measure for both."
Ezekiel,45,12,The shekel is to consist of twenty gerahs. Twenty shekels plus twenty-five shekels plus fifteen shekels equal one mina.
Ezekiel,45,13,“‘This is the special gift you are to offer: a sixth of an ephah from each homer of wheat and a sixth of an ephah from each homer of barley.
Ezekiel,45,14,"The prescribed portion of olive oil, measured by the bath, is a tenth of a bath from each cor (which consists of ten baths or one homer, for ten baths are equivalent to a homer)."
Ezekiel,45,15,"Also one sheep is to be taken from every flock of two hundred from the well-watered pastures of Israel. These will be used for the grain offerings, burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to make atonement for the people, declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,45,16,All the people of the land will be required to give this special offering to the prince in Israel.
Ezekiel,45,17,"It will be the duty of the prince to provide the burnt offerings, grain offerings and drink offerings at the festivals, the New Moons and the Sabbaths—at all the appointed festivals of Israel. He will provide the sin offerings, grain offerings, burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to make atonement for the Israelites."
Ezekiel,45,18,“‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: In the first month on the first day you are to take a young bull without defect and purify the sanctuary.
Ezekiel,45,19,"The priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the temple, on the four corners of the upper ledge of the altar and on the gateposts of the inner court."
Ezekiel,45,20,You are to do the same on the seventh day of the month for anyone who sins unintentionally or through ignorance; so you are to make atonement for the temple.
Ezekiel,45,21,"“‘In the first month on the fourteenth day you are to observe the Passover, a festival lasting seven days, during which you shall eat bread made without yeast."
Ezekiel,45,22,On that day the prince is to provide a bull as a sin offering for himself and for all the people of the land.
Ezekiel,45,23,"Every day during the seven days of the festival he is to provide seven bulls and seven rams without defect as a burnt offering to the LORD, and a male goat for a sin offering."
Ezekiel,45,24,"He is to provide as a grain offering an ephah for each bull and an ephah for each ram, along with a hin of olive oil for each ephah."
Ezekiel,45,25,"“‘During the seven days of the festival, which begins in the seventh month on the fifteenth day, he is to make the same provision for sin offerings, burnt offerings, grain offerings and oil."
Ezekiel,46,1,"“‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: The gate of the inner court facing east is to be shut on the six working days, but on the Sabbath day and on the day of the New Moon it is to be opened."
Ezekiel,46,2,"The prince is to enter from the outside through the portico of the gateway and stand by the gatepost. The priests are to sacrifice his burnt offering and his fellowship offerings. He is to bow down in worship at the threshold of the gateway and then go out, but the gate will not be shut until evening."
Ezekiel,46,3,On the Sabbaths and New Moons the people of the land are to worship in the presence of the LORD at the entrance of that gateway.
Ezekiel,46,4,"The burnt offering the prince brings to the LORD on the Sabbath day is to be six male lambs and a ram, all without defect."
Ezekiel,46,5,"The grain offering given with the ram is to be an ephah, and the grain offering with the lambs is to be as much as he pleases, along with a hin of olive oil for each ephah."
Ezekiel,46,6,"On the day of the New Moon he is to offer a young bull, six lambs and a ram, all without defect."
Ezekiel,46,7,"He is to provide as a grain offering one ephah with the bull, one ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he wants to give, along with a hin of oil for each ephah."
Ezekiel,46,8,"When the prince enters, he is to go in through the portico of the gateway, and he is to come out the same way."
Ezekiel,46,9,"“‘When the people of the land come before the LORD at the appointed festivals, whoever enters by the north gate to worship is to go out the south gate; and whoever enters by the south gate is to go out the north gate. No one is to return through the gate by which they entered, but each is to go out the opposite gate."
Ezekiel,46,10,"The prince is to be among them, going in when they go in and going out when they go out."
Ezekiel,46,11,"At the feasts and the appointed festivals, the grain offering is to be an ephah with a bull, an ephah with a ram, and with the lambs as much as he pleases, along with a hin of oil for each ephah."
Ezekiel,46,12,"“‘When the prince provides a freewill offering to the LORD—whether a burnt offering or fellowship offerings—the gate facing east is to be opened for him. He shall offer his burnt offering or his fellowship offerings as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and after he has gone out, the gate will be shut."
Ezekiel,46,13,“‘Every day you are to provide a year-old lamb without defect for a burnt offering to the LORD; morning by morning you shall provide it.
Ezekiel,46,14,"You are also to provide with it morning by morning a grain offering, consisting of a sixth of an ephah with a third of a hin of oil to moisten the flour. The presenting of this grain offering to the LORD is a lasting ordinance."
Ezekiel,46,15,So the lamb and the grain offering and the oil shall be provided morning by morning for a regular burnt offering.
Ezekiel,46,16,"“‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: If the prince makes a gift from his inheritance to one of his sons, it will also belong to his descendants; it is to be their property by inheritance."
Ezekiel,46,17,"If, however, he makes a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, the servant may keep it until the year of freedom; then it will revert to the prince. His inheritance belongs to his sons only; it is theirs."
Ezekiel,46,18,"The prince must not take any of the inheritance of the people, driving them off their property. He is to give his sons their inheritance out of his own property, so that not one of my people will be separated from their property.’”"
Ezekiel,46,19,"Then the man brought me through the entrance at the side of the gate to the sacred rooms facing north, which belonged to the priests, and showed me a place at the western end."
Ezekiel,46,20,"He said to me, “This is the place where the priests are to cook the guilt offering and the sin offering and bake the grain offering, to avoid bringing them into the outer court and consecrating the people.”"
Ezekiel,46,21,"He then brought me to the outer court and led me around to its four corners, and I saw in each corner another court."
Ezekiel,46,22,"In the four corners of the outer court were enclosed courts, forty cubits long and thirty cubits wide; each of the courts in the four corners was the same size."
Ezekiel,46,23,"Around the inside of each of the four courts was a ledge of stone, with places for fire built all around under the ledge."
Ezekiel,46,24,"He said to me, “These are the kitchens where those who minister at the temple are to cook the sacrifices of the people.”"
Ezekiel,47,1,"The man brought me back to the entrance to the temple, and I saw water coming out from under the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east). The water was coming down from under the south side of the temple, south of the altar."
Ezekiel,47,2,"He then brought me out through the north gate and led me around the outside to the outer gate facing east, and the water was trickling from the south side."
Ezekiel,47,3,"As the man went eastward with a measuring line in his hand, he measured off a thousand cubits and then led me through water that was ankle-deep."
Ezekiel,47,4,He measured off another thousand cubits and led me through water that was knee-deep. He measured off another thousand and led me through water that was up to the waist.
Ezekiel,47,5,"He measured off another thousand, but now it was a river that I could not cross, because the water had risen and was deep enough to swim in—a river that no one could cross."
Ezekiel,47,6,"He asked me, “Son of man, do you see this?” Then he led me back to the bank of the river."
Ezekiel,47,7,"When I arrived there, I saw a great number of trees on each side of the river."
Ezekiel,47,8,"He said to me, “This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah, where it enters the Dead Sea. When it empties into the sea, the salty water there becomes fresh."
Ezekiel,47,9,"Swarms of living creatures will live wherever the river flows. There will be large numbers of fish, because this water flows there and makes the salt water fresh; so where the river flows everything will live."
Ezekiel,47,10,Fishermen will stand along the shore; from En Gedi to En Eglaim there will be places for spreading nets. The fish will be of many kinds—like the fish of the Mediterranean Sea.
Ezekiel,47,11,But the swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they will be left for salt.
Ezekiel,47,12,"Fruit trees of all kinds will grow on both banks of the river. Their leaves will not wither, nor will their fruit fail. Every month they will bear fruit, because the water from the sanctuary flows to them. Their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing.”"
Ezekiel,47,13,"This is what the Sovereign LORD says: “These are the boundaries of the land that you will divide among the twelve tribes of Israel as their inheritance, with two portions for Joseph."
Ezekiel,47,14,"You are to divide it equally among them. Because I swore with uplifted hand to give it to your ancestors, this land will become your inheritance."
Ezekiel,47,15,"“This is to be the boundary of the land: “On the north side it will run from the Mediterranean Sea by the Hethlon road past Lebo Hamath to Zedad,"
Ezekiel,47,16,"Berothah and Sibraim (which lies on the border between Damascus and Hamath), as far as Hazer Hattikon, which is on the border of Hauran."
Ezekiel,47,17,"The boundary will extend from the sea to Hazar Enan, along the northern border of Damascus, with the border of Hamath to the north. This will be the northern boundary."
Ezekiel,47,18,"“On the east side the boundary will run between Hauran and Damascus, along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel, to the Dead Sea and as far as Tamar. This will be the eastern boundary."
Ezekiel,47,19,"“On the south side it will run from Tamar as far as the waters of Meribah Kadesh, then along the Wadi of Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea. This will be the southern boundary."
Ezekiel,47,20,"“On the west side, the Mediterranean Sea will be the boundary to a point opposite Lebo Hamath. This will be the western boundary."
Ezekiel,47,21,“You are to distribute this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.
Ezekiel,47,22,You are to allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the foreigners residing among you and who have children. You are to consider them as native-born Israelites; along with you they are to be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
Ezekiel,47,23,"In whatever tribe a foreigner resides, there you are to give them their inheritance,” declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,48,1,"“These are the tribes, listed by name: At the northern frontier, Dan will have one portion; it will follow the Hethlon road to Lebo Hamath; Hazar Enan and the northern border of Damascus next to Hamath will be part of its border from the east side to the west side."
Ezekiel,48,2,“Asher will have one portion; it will border the territory of Dan from east to west.
Ezekiel,48,3,“Naphtali will have one portion; it will border the territory of Asher from east to west.
Ezekiel,48,4,“Manasseh will have one portion; it will border the territory of Naphtali from east to west.
Ezekiel,48,5,“Ephraim will have one portion; it will border the territory of Manasseh from east to west.
Ezekiel,48,6,“Reuben will have one portion; it will border the territory of Ephraim from east to west.
Ezekiel,48,7,“Judah will have one portion; it will border the territory of Reuben from east to west.
Ezekiel,48,8,"“Bordering the territory of Judah from east to west will be the portion you are to present as a special gift. It will be 25,000 cubits wide, and its length from east to west will equal one of the tribal portions; the sanctuary will be in the center of it."
Ezekiel,48,9,"“The special portion you are to offer to the LORD will be 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide."
Ezekiel,48,10,"This will be the sacred portion for the priests. It will be 25,000 cubits long on the north side, 10,000 cubits wide on the west side, 10,000 cubits wide on the east side and 25,000 cubits long on the south side. In the center of it will be the sanctuary of the LORD."
Ezekiel,48,11,"This will be for the consecrated priests, the Zadokites, who were faithful in serving me and did not go astray as the Levites did when the Israelites went astray."
Ezekiel,48,12,"It will be a special gift to them from the sacred portion of the land, a most holy portion, bordering the territory of the Levites."
Ezekiel,48,13,"“Alongside the territory of the priests, the Levites will have an allotment 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide. Its total length will be 25,000 cubits and its width 10,000 cubits."
Ezekiel,48,14,"They must not sell or exchange any of it. This is the best of the land and must not pass into other hands, because it is holy to the LORD."
Ezekiel,48,15,"“The remaining area, 5,000 cubits wide and 25,000 cubits long, will be for the common use of the city, for houses and for pastureland. The city will be in the center of it"
Ezekiel,48,16,"and will have these measurements: the north side 4,500 cubits, the south side 4,500 cubits, the east side 4,500 cubits, and the west side 4,500 cubits."
Ezekiel,48,17,"The pastureland for the city will be 250 cubits on the north, 250 cubits on the south, 250 cubits on the east, and 250 cubits on the west."
Ezekiel,48,18,"What remains of the area, bordering on the sacred portion and running the length of it, will be 10,000 cubits on the east side and 10,000 cubits on the west side. Its produce will supply food for the workers of the city."
Ezekiel,48,19,The workers from the city who farm it will come from all the tribes of Israel.
Ezekiel,48,20,"The entire portion will be a square, 25,000 cubits on each side. As a special gift you will set aside the sacred portion, along with the property of the city."
Ezekiel,48,21,"“What remains on both sides of the area formed by the sacred portion and the property of the city will belong to the prince. It will extend eastward from the 25,000 cubits of the sacred portion to the eastern border, and westward from the 25,000 cubits to the western border. Both these areas running the length of the tribal portions will belong to the prince, and the sacred portion with the temple sanctuary will be in the center of them."
Ezekiel,48,22,So the property of the Levites and the property of the city will lie in the center of the area that belongs to the prince. The area belonging to the prince will lie between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin.
Ezekiel,48,23,“As for the rest of the tribes: Benjamin will have one portion; it will extend from the east side to the west side.
Ezekiel,48,24,“Simeon will have one portion; it will border the territory of Benjamin from east to west.
Ezekiel,48,25,“Issachar will have one portion; it will border the territory of Simeon from east to west.
Ezekiel,48,26,“Zebulun will have one portion; it will border the territory of Issachar from east to west.
Ezekiel,48,27,“Gad will have one portion; it will border the territory of Zebulun from east to west.
Ezekiel,48,28,"“The southern boundary of Gad will run south from Tamar to the waters of Meribah Kadesh, then along the Wadi of Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea."
Ezekiel,48,29,"“This is the land you are to allot as an inheritance to the tribes of Israel, and these will be their portions,” declares the Sovereign LORD."
Ezekiel,48,30,"“These will be the exits of the city: Beginning on the north side, which is 4,500 cubits long,"
Ezekiel,48,31,"the gates of the city will be named after the tribes of Israel. The three gates on the north side will be the gate of Reuben, the gate of Judah and the gate of Levi."
Ezekiel,48,32,"“On the east side, which is 4,500 cubits long, will be three gates: the gate of Joseph, the gate of Benjamin and the gate of Dan."
Ezekiel,48,33,"“On the south side, which measures 4,500 cubits, will be three gates: the gate of Simeon, the gate of Issachar and the gate of Zebulun."
Ezekiel,48,34,"“On the west side, which is 4,500 cubits long, will be three gates: the gate of Gad, the gate of Asher and the gate of Naphtali."
Ezekiel,48,35,"“The distance all around will be 18,000 cubits. “And the name of the city from that time on will be: THE LORD IS THERE.”"
Daniel,1,1,"In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it."
Daniel,1,2,"And the Lord delivered Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, along with some of the articles from the temple of God. These he carried off to the temple of his god in Babylonia and put in the treasure house of his god."
Daniel,1,3,"Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, chief of his court officials, to bring into the king’s service some of the Israelites from the royal family and the nobility—"
Daniel,1,4,"young men without any physical defect, handsome, showing aptitude for every kind of learning, well informed, quick to understand, and qualified to serve in the king’s palace. He was to teach them the language and literature of the Babylonians."
Daniel,1,5,"The king assigned them a daily amount of food and wine from the king’s table. They were to be trained for three years, and after that they were to enter the king’s service."
Daniel,1,6,"Among those who were chosen were some from Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah."
Daniel,1,7,"The chief official gave them new names: to Daniel, the name Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego."
Daniel,1,8,"But Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the royal food and wine, and he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself this way."
Daniel,1,9,"Now God had caused the official to show favor and compassion to Daniel,"
Daniel,1,10,"but the official told Daniel, “I am afraid of my lord the king, who has assigned your food and drink. Why should he see you looking worse than the other young men your age? The king would then have my head because of you.”"
Daniel,1,11,"Daniel then said to the guard whom the chief official had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah,"
Daniel,1,12,“Please test your servants for ten days: Give us nothing but vegetables to eat and water to drink.
Daniel,1,13,"Then compare our appearance with that of the young men who eat the royal food, and treat your servants in accordance with what you see.”"
Daniel,1,14,So he agreed to this and tested them for ten days.
Daniel,1,15,At the end of the ten days they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food.
Daniel,1,16,So the guard took away their choice food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables instead.
Daniel,1,17,To these four young men God gave knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning. And Daniel could understand visions and dreams of all kinds.
Daniel,1,18,"At the end of the time set by the king to bring them into his service, the chief official presented them to Nebuchadnezzar."
Daniel,1,19,"The king talked with them, and he found none equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah; so they entered the king’s service."
Daniel,1,20,"In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom."
Daniel,1,21,And Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.
Daniel,2,1,"In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; his mind was troubled and he could not sleep."
Daniel,2,2,"So the king summoned the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers and astrologers to tell him what he had dreamed. When they came in and stood before the king,"
Daniel,2,3,"he said to them, “I have had a dream that troubles me and I want to know what it means.”"
Daniel,2,4,"Then the astrologers answered the king, “May the king live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will interpret it.”"
Daniel,2,5,"The king replied to the astrologers, “This is what I have firmly decided: If you do not tell me what my dream was and interpret it, I will have you cut into pieces and your houses turned into piles of rubble."
Daniel,2,6,"But if you tell me the dream and explain it, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. So tell me the dream and interpret it for me.”"
Daniel,2,7,"Once more they replied, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will interpret it.”"
Daniel,2,8,"Then the king answered, “I am certain that you are trying to gain time, because you realize that this is what I have firmly decided:"
Daniel,2,9,"If you do not tell me the dream, there is only one penalty for you. You have conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things, hoping the situation will change. So then, tell me the dream, and I will know that you can interpret it for me.”"
Daniel,2,10,"The astrologers answered the king, “There is no one on earth who can do what the king asks! No king, however great and mighty, has ever asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or astrologer."
Daniel,2,11,"What the king asks is too difficult. No one can reveal it to the king except the gods, and they do not live among humans.”"
Daniel,2,12,This made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon.
Daniel,2,13,"So the decree was issued to put the wise men to death, and men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to put them to death."
Daniel,2,14,"When Arioch, the commander of the king’s guard, had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon, Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and tact."
Daniel,2,15,"He asked the king’s officer, “Why did the king issue such a harsh decree?” Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel."
Daniel,2,16,"At this, Daniel went in to the king and asked for time, so that he might interpret the dream for him."
Daniel,2,17,"Then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah."
Daniel,2,18,"He urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon."
Daniel,2,19,During the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven
Daniel,2,20,and said: “Praise be to the name of God for ever and ever; wisdom and power are his.
Daniel,2,21,He changes times and seasons; he deposes kings and raises up others. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning.
Daniel,2,22,"He reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what lies in darkness, and light dwells with him."
Daniel,2,23,"I thank and praise you, God of my ancestors: You have given me wisdom and power, you have made known to me what we asked of you, you have made known to us the dream of the king.”"
Daniel,2,24,"Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, “Do not execute the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will interpret his dream for him.”"
Daniel,2,25,"Arioch took Daniel to the king at once and said, “I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can tell the king what his dream means.”"
Daniel,2,26,"The king asked Daniel (also called Belteshazzar), “Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream and interpret it?”"
Daniel,2,27,"Daniel replied, “No wise man, enchanter, magician or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about,"
Daniel,2,28,but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come. Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you were lying in bed are these:
Daniel,2,29,"“As Your Majesty was lying there, your mind turned to things to come, and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen."
Daniel,2,30,"As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have greater wisdom than anyone else alive, but so that Your Majesty may know the interpretation and that you may understand what went through your mind."
Daniel,2,31,"“Your Majesty looked, and there before you stood a large statue—an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance."
Daniel,2,32,"The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze,"
Daniel,2,33,"its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay."
Daniel,2,34,"While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them."
Daniel,2,35,"Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were all broken to pieces and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth."
Daniel,2,36,"“This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king."
Daniel,2,37,"Your Majesty, you are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory;"
Daniel,2,38,"in your hands he has placed all mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds in the sky. Wherever they live, he has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold."
Daniel,2,39,"“After you, another kingdom will arise, inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth."
Daniel,2,40,"Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron—for iron breaks and smashes everything—and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others."
Daniel,2,41,"Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay."
Daniel,2,42,"As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle."
Daniel,2,43,"And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay."
Daniel,2,44,"“In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever."
Daniel,2,45,"This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands—a rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces. “The great God has shown the king what will take place in the future. The dream is true and its interpretation is trustworthy.”"
Daniel,2,46,Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel and paid him honor and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him.
Daniel,2,47,"The king said to Daniel, “Surely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery.”"
Daniel,2,48,Then the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts on him. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men.
Daniel,2,49,"Moreover, at Daniel’s request the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego administrators over the province of Babylon, while Daniel himself remained at the royal court."
Daniel,3,1,"King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, sixty cubits high and six cubits wide, and set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon."
Daniel,3,2,"He then summoned the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials to come to the dedication of the image he had set up."
Daniel,3,3,"So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials assembled for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up, and they stood before it."
Daniel,3,4,"Then the herald loudly proclaimed, “Nations and peoples of every language, this is what you are commanded to do:"
Daniel,3,5,"As soon as you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up."
Daniel,3,6,Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace.”
Daniel,3,7,"Therefore, as soon as they heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp and all kinds of music, all the nations and peoples of every language fell down and worshiped the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up."
Daniel,3,8,At this time some astrologers came forward and denounced the Jews.
Daniel,3,9,"They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “May the king live forever!"
Daniel,3,10,"Your Majesty has issued a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe and all kinds of music must fall down and worship the image of gold,"
Daniel,3,11,and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a blazing furnace.
Daniel,3,12,"But there are some Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon—Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego—who pay no attention to you, Your Majesty. They neither serve your gods nor worship the image of gold you have set up.”"
Daniel,3,13,"Furious with rage, Nebuchadnezzar summoned Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. So these men were brought before the king,"
Daniel,3,14,"and Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the image of gold I have set up?"
Daniel,3,15,"Now when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe and all kinds of music, if you are ready to fall down and worship the image I made, very good. But if you do not worship it, you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace. Then what god will be able to rescue you from my hand?”"
Daniel,3,16,"Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied to him, “King Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter."
Daniel,3,17,"If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to deliver us from it, and he will deliver us from Your Majesty’s hand."
Daniel,3,18,"But even if he does not, we want you to know, Your Majesty, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up.”"
Daniel,3,19,"Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, and his attitude toward them changed. He ordered the furnace heated seven times hotter than usual"
Daniel,3,20,"and commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace."
Daniel,3,21,"So these men, wearing their robes, trousers, turbans and other clothes, were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace."
Daniel,3,22,"The king’s command was so urgent and the furnace so hot that the flames of the fire killed the soldiers who took up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego,"
Daniel,3,23,"and these three men, firmly tied, fell into the blazing furnace."
Daniel,3,24,"Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement and asked his advisers, “Weren’t there three men that we tied up and threw into the fire?” They replied, “Certainly, Your Majesty.”"
Daniel,3,25,"He said, “Look! I see four men walking around in the fire, unbound and unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods.”"
Daniel,3,26,"Nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening of the blazing furnace and shouted, “Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!” So Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego came out of the fire,"
Daniel,3,27,"and the satraps, prefects, governors and royal advisers crowded around them. They saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies, nor was a hair of their heads singed; their robes were not scorched, and there was no smell of fire on them."
Daniel,3,28,"Then Nebuchadnezzar said, “Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who has sent his angel and rescued his servants! They trusted in him and defied the king’s command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God."
Daniel,3,29,"Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego be cut into pieces and their houses be turned into piles of rubble, for no other god can save in this way.”"
Daniel,3,30,"Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon."
Daniel,4,1,"King Nebuchadnezzar, To the nations and peoples of every language, who live in all the earth: May you prosper greatly!"
Daniel,4,2,It is my pleasure to tell you about the miraculous signs and wonders that the Most High God has performed for me.
Daniel,4,3,"How great are his signs, how mighty his wonders! His kingdom is an eternal kingdom; his dominion endures from generation to generation."
Daniel,4,4,"I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at home in my palace, contented and prosperous."
Daniel,4,5,"I had a dream that made me afraid. As I was lying in bed, the images and visions that passed through my mind terrified me."
Daniel,4,6,So I commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be brought before me to interpret the dream for me.
Daniel,4,7,"When the magicians, enchanters, astrologers and diviners came, I told them the dream, but they could not interpret it for me."
Daniel,4,8,"Finally, Daniel came into my presence and I told him the dream. (He is called Belteshazzar, after the name of my god, and the spirit of the holy gods is in him.)"
Daniel,4,9,"I said, “Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no mystery is too difficult for you. Here is my dream; interpret it for me."
Daniel,4,10,"These are the visions I saw while lying in bed: I looked, and there before me stood a tree in the middle of the land. Its height was enormous."
Daniel,4,11,The tree grew large and strong and its top touched the sky; it was visible to the ends of the earth.
Daniel,4,12,"Its leaves were beautiful, its fruit abundant, and on it was food for all. Under it the wild animals found shelter, and the birds lived in its branches; from it every creature was fed."
Daniel,4,13,"“In the visions I saw while lying in bed, I looked, and there before me was a holy one, a messenger, coming down from heaven."
Daniel,4,14,He called in a loud voice: ‘Cut down the tree and trim off its branches; strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the animals flee from under it and the birds from its branches.
Daniel,4,15,"But let the stump and its roots, bound with iron and bronze, remain in the ground, in the grass of the field. “‘Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, and let him live with the animals among the plants of the earth."
Daniel,4,16,"Let his mind be changed from that of a man and let him be given the mind of an animal, till seven times pass by for him."
Daniel,4,17,"“‘The decision is announced by messengers, the holy ones declare the verdict, so that the living may know that the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and gives them to anyone he wishes and sets over them the lowliest of people.’"
Daniel,4,18,"“This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had. Now, Belteshazzar, tell me what it means, for none of the wise men in my kingdom can interpret it for me. But you can, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.”"
Daniel,4,19,"Then Daniel (also called Belteshazzar) was greatly perplexed for a time, and his thoughts terrified him. So the king said, “Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its meaning alarm you.” Belteshazzar answered, “My lord, if only the dream applied to your enemies and its meaning to your adversaries!"
Daniel,4,20,"The tree you saw, which grew large and strong, with its top touching the sky, visible to the whole earth,"
Daniel,4,21,"with beautiful leaves and abundant fruit, providing food for all, giving shelter to the wild animals, and having nesting places in its branches for the birds—"
Daniel,4,22,"Your Majesty, you are that tree! You have become great and strong; your greatness has grown until it reaches the sky, and your dominion extends to distant parts of the earth."
Daniel,4,23,"“Your Majesty saw a holy one, a messenger, coming down from heaven and saying, ‘Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump, bound with iron and bronze, in the grass of the field, while its roots remain in the ground. Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven; let him live with the wild animals, until seven times pass by for him.’"
Daniel,4,24,"“This is the interpretation, Your Majesty, and this is the decree the Most High has issued against my lord the king:"
Daniel,4,25,You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like the ox and be drenched with the dew of heaven. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and gives them to anyone he wishes.
Daniel,4,26,The command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots means that your kingdom will be restored to you when you acknowledge that Heaven rules.
Daniel,4,27,"Therefore, Your Majesty, be pleased to accept my advice: Renounce your sins by doing what is right, and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed. It may be that then your prosperity will continue.”"
Daniel,4,28,All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.
Daniel,4,29,"Twelve months later, as the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon,"
Daniel,4,30,"he said, “Is not this the great Babylon I have built as the royal residence, by my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty?”"
Daniel,4,31,"Even as the words were on his lips, a voice came from heaven, “This is what is decreed for you, King Nebuchadnezzar: Your royal authority has been taken from you."
Daniel,4,32,You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like the ox. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and gives them to anyone he wishes.”
Daniel,4,33,Immediately what had been said about Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was driven away from people and ate grass like the ox. His body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and his nails like the claws of a bird.
Daniel,4,34,"At the end of that time, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven, and my sanity was restored. Then I praised the Most High; I honored and glorified him who lives forever. His dominion is an eternal dominion; his kingdom endures from generation to generation."
Daniel,4,35,All the peoples of the earth are regarded as nothing. He does as he pleases with the powers of heaven and the peoples of the earth. No one can hold back his hand or say to him: “What have you done?”
Daniel,4,36,"At the same time that my sanity was restored, my honor and splendor were returned to me for the glory of my kingdom. My advisers and nobles sought me out, and I was restored to my throne and became even greater than before."
Daniel,4,37,"Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven, because everything he does is right and all his ways are just. And those who walk in pride he is able to humble."
Daniel,5,1,King Belshazzar gave a great banquet for a thousand of his nobles and drank wine with them.
Daniel,5,2,"While Belshazzar was drinking his wine, he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver goblets that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, so that the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines might drink from them."
Daniel,5,3,"So they brought in the gold goblets that had been taken from the temple of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines drank from them."
Daniel,5,4,"As they drank the wine, they praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood and stone."
Daniel,5,5,"Suddenly the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in the royal palace. The king watched the hand as it wrote."
Daniel,5,6,His face turned pale and he was so frightened that his legs became weak and his knees were knocking.
Daniel,5,7,"The king summoned the enchanters, astrologers and diviners. Then he said to these wise men of Babylon, “Whoever reads this writing and tells me what it means will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around his neck, and he will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.”"
Daniel,5,8,"Then all the king’s wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or tell the king what it meant."
Daniel,5,9,So King Belshazzar became even more terrified and his face grew more pale. His nobles were baffled.
Daniel,5,10,"The queen, hearing the voices of the king and his nobles, came into the banquet hall. “May the king live forever!” she said. “Don’t be alarmed! Don’t look so pale!"
Daniel,5,11,"There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. In the time of your father he was found to have insight and intelligence and wisdom like that of the gods. Your father, King Nebuchadnezzar, appointed him chief of the magicians, enchanters, astrologers and diviners."
Daniel,5,12,"He did this because Daniel, whom the king called Belteshazzar, was found to have a keen mind and knowledge and understanding, and also the ability to interpret dreams, explain riddles and solve difficult problems. Call for Daniel, and he will tell you what the writing means.”"
Daniel,5,13,"So Daniel was brought before the king, and the king said to him, “Are you Daniel, one of the exiles my father the king brought from Judah?"
Daniel,5,14,"I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you and that you have insight, intelligence and outstanding wisdom."
Daniel,5,15,"The wise men and enchanters were brought before me to read this writing and tell me what it means, but they could not explain it."
Daniel,5,16,"Now I have heard that you are able to give interpretations and to solve difficult problems. If you can read this writing and tell me what it means, you will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around your neck, and you will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.”"
Daniel,5,17,"Then Daniel answered the king, “You may keep your gifts for yourself and give your rewards to someone else. Nevertheless, I will read the writing for the king and tell him what it means."
Daniel,5,18,"“Your Majesty, the Most High God gave your father Nebuchadnezzar sovereignty and greatness and glory and splendor."
Daniel,5,19,"Because of the high position he gave him, all the nations and peoples of every language dreaded and feared him. Those the king wanted to put to death, he put to death; those he wanted to spare, he spared; those he wanted to promote, he promoted; and those he wanted to humble, he humbled."
Daniel,5,20,"But when his heart became arrogant and hardened with pride, he was deposed from his royal throne and stripped of his glory."
Daniel,5,21,"He was driven away from people and given the mind of an animal; he lived with the wild donkeys and ate grass like the ox; and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven, until he acknowledged that the Most High God is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and sets over them anyone he wishes."
Daniel,5,22,"“But you, Belshazzar, his son, have not humbled yourself, though you knew all this."
Daniel,5,23,"Instead, you have set yourself up against the Lord of heaven. You had the goblets from his temple brought to you, and you and your nobles, your wives and your concubines drank wine from them. You praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or understand. But you did not honor the God who holds in his hand your life and all your ways."
Daniel,5,24,Therefore he sent the hand that wrote the inscription.
Daniel,5,25,"“This is the inscription that was written: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, PARSIN"
Daniel,5,26,“Here is what these words mean: Mene: God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end.
Daniel,5,27,Tekel: You have been weighed on the scales and found wanting.
Daniel,5,28,Peres: Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.”
Daniel,5,29,"Then at Belshazzar’s command, Daniel was clothed in purple, a gold chain was placed around his neck, and he was proclaimed the third highest ruler in the kingdom."
Daniel,5,30,"That very night Belshazzar, king of the Babylonians, was slain,"
Daniel,5,31,"and Darius the Mede took over the kingdom, at the age of sixty-two."
Daniel,6,1,"It pleased Darius to appoint 120 satraps to rule throughout the kingdom,"
Daniel,6,2,"with three administrators over them, one of whom was Daniel. The satraps were made accountable to them so that the king might not suffer loss."
Daniel,6,3,Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom.
Daniel,6,4,"At this, the administrators and the satraps tried to find grounds for charges against Daniel in his conduct of government affairs, but they were unable to do so. They could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent."
Daniel,6,5,"Finally these men said, “We will never find any basis for charges against this man Daniel unless it has something to do with the law of his God.”"
Daniel,6,6,So these administrators and satraps went as a group to the king and said: “May King Darius live forever!
Daniel,6,7,"The royal administrators, prefects, satraps, advisers and governors have all agreed that the king should issue an edict and enforce the decree that anyone who prays to any god or human being during the next thirty days, except to you, Your Majesty, shall be thrown into the lions’ den."
Daniel,6,8,"Now, Your Majesty, issue the decree and put it in writing so that it cannot be altered—in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.”"
Daniel,6,9,So King Darius put the decree in writing.
Daniel,6,10,"Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published, he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward Jerusalem. Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed, giving thanks to his God, just as he had done before."
Daniel,6,11,Then these men went as a group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help.
Daniel,6,12,"So they went to the king and spoke to him about his royal decree: “Did you not publish a decree that during the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or human being except to you, Your Majesty, would be thrown into the lions’ den?” The king answered, “The decree stands—in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.”"
Daniel,6,13,"Then they said to the king, “Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, Your Majesty, or to the decree you put in writing. He still prays three times a day.”"
Daniel,6,14,"When the king heard this, he was greatly distressed; he was determined to rescue Daniel and made every effort until sundown to save him."
Daniel,6,15,"Then the men went as a group to King Darius and said to him, “Remember, Your Majesty, that according to the law of the Medes and Persians no decree or edict that the king issues can be changed.”"
Daniel,6,16,"So the king gave the order, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the lions’ den. The king said to Daniel, “May your God, whom you serve continually, rescue you!”"
Daniel,6,17,"A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the rings of his nobles, so that Daniel’s situation might not be changed."
Daniel,6,18,Then the king returned to his palace and spent the night without eating and without any entertainment being brought to him. And he could not sleep.
Daniel,6,19,"At the first light of dawn, the king got up and hurried to the lions’ den."
Daniel,6,20,"When he came near the den, he called to Daniel in an anguished voice, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to rescue you from the lions?”"
Daniel,6,21,"Daniel answered, “May the king live forever!"
Daniel,6,22,"My God sent his angel, and he shut the mouths of the lions. They have not hurt me, because I was found innocent in his sight. Nor have I ever done any wrong before you, Your Majesty.”"
Daniel,6,23,"The king was overjoyed and gave orders to lift Daniel out of the den. And when Daniel was lifted from the den, no wound was found on him, because he had trusted in his God."
Daniel,6,24,"At the king’s command, the men who had falsely accused Daniel were brought in and thrown into the lions’ den, along with their wives and children. And before they reached the floor of the den, the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones."
Daniel,6,25,Then King Darius wrote to all the nations and peoples of every language in all the earth: “May you prosper greatly!
Daniel,6,26,"“I issue a decree that in every part of my kingdom people must fear and reverence the God of Daniel. “For he is the living God and he endures forever; his kingdom will not be destroyed, his dominion will never end."
Daniel,6,27,He rescues and he saves; he performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth. He has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions.”
Daniel,6,28,So Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
Daniel,7,1,"In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions passed through his mind as he was lying in bed. He wrote down the substance of his dream."
Daniel,7,2,"Daniel said: “In my vision at night I looked, and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea."
Daniel,7,3,"Four great beasts, each different from the others, came up out of the sea."
Daniel,7,4,"“The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a human being, and the mind of a human was given to it."
Daniel,7,5,"“And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, ‘Get up and eat your fill of flesh!’"
Daniel,7,6,"“After that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard. And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule."
Daniel,7,7,"“After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast—terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns."
Daniel,7,8,"“While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a human being and a mouth that spoke boastfully."
Daniel,7,9,"“As I looked, “thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was as white as snow; the hair of his head was white like wool. His throne was flaming with fire, and its wheels were all ablaze."
Daniel,7,10,"A river of fire was flowing, coming out from before him. Thousands upon thousands attended him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The court was seated, and the books were opened."
Daniel,7,11,“Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire.
Daniel,7,12,"(The other beasts had been stripped of their authority, but were allowed to live for a period of time.)"
Daniel,7,13,"“In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence."
Daniel,7,14,"He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all nations and peoples of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed."
Daniel,7,15,"“I, Daniel, was troubled in spirit, and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me."
Daniel,7,16,I approached one of those standing there and asked him the meaning of all this. “So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things:
Daniel,7,17,‘The four great beasts are four kings that will rise from the earth.
Daniel,7,18,"But the holy people of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever—yes, for ever and ever.’"
Daniel,7,19,"“Then I wanted to know the meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws—the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left."
Daniel,7,20,"I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell—the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully."
Daniel,7,21,"As I watched, this horn was waging war against the holy people and defeating them,"
Daniel,7,22,"until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the holy people of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom."
Daniel,7,23,"“He gave me this explanation: ‘The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it."
Daniel,7,24,"The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings."
Daniel,7,25,"He will speak against the Most High and oppress his holy people and try to change the set times and the laws. The holy people will be delivered into his hands for a time, times and half a time."
Daniel,7,26,"“‘But the court will sit, and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed forever."
Daniel,7,27,"Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of all the kingdoms under heaven will be handed over to the holy people of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey him.’"
Daniel,7,28,"“This is the end of the matter. I, Daniel, was deeply troubled by my thoughts, and my face turned pale, but I kept the matter to myself.”"
Daniel,8,1,"In the third year of King Belshazzar’s reign, I, Daniel, had a vision, after the one that had already appeared to me."
Daniel,8,2,In my vision I saw myself in the citadel of Susa in the province of Elam; in the vision I was beside the Ulai Canal.
Daniel,8,3,"I looked up, and there before me was a ram with two horns, standing beside the canal, and the horns were long. One of the horns was longer than the other but grew up later."
Daniel,8,4,"I watched the ram as it charged toward the west and the north and the south. No animal could stand against it, and none could rescue from its power. It did as it pleased and became great."
Daniel,8,5,"As I was thinking about this, suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between its eyes came from the west, crossing the whole earth without touching the ground."
Daniel,8,6,It came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and charged at it in great rage.
Daniel,8,7,"I saw it attack the ram furiously, striking the ram and shattering its two horns. The ram was powerless to stand against it; the goat knocked it to the ground and trampled on it, and none could rescue the ram from its power."
Daniel,8,8,"The goat became very great, but at the height of its power the large horn was broken off, and in its place four prominent horns grew up toward the four winds of heaven."
Daniel,8,9,"Out of one of them came another horn, which started small but grew in power to the south and to the east and toward the Beautiful Land."
Daniel,8,10,"It grew until it reached the host of the heavens, and it threw some of the starry host down to the earth and trampled on them."
Daniel,8,11,"It set itself up to be as great as the commander of the army of the LORD; it took away the daily sacrifice from the LORD, and his sanctuary was thrown down."
Daniel,8,12,"Because of rebellion, the LORD’s people and the daily sacrifice were given over to it. It prospered in everything it did, and truth was thrown to the ground."
Daniel,8,13,"Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to him, “How long will it take for the vision to be fulfilled—the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, the rebellion that causes desolation, the surrender of the sanctuary and the trampling underfoot of the LORD’s people?”"
Daniel,8,14,"He said to me, “It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be reconsecrated.”"
Daniel,8,15,"While I, Daniel, was watching the vision and trying to understand it, there before me stood one who looked like a man."
Daniel,8,16,"And I heard a man’s voice from the Ulai calling, “Gabriel, tell this man the meaning of the vision.”"
Daniel,8,17,"As he came near the place where I was standing, I was terrified and fell prostrate. “Son of man,” he said to me, “understand that the vision concerns the time of the end.”"
Daniel,8,18,"While he was speaking to me, I was in a deep sleep, with my face to the ground. Then he touched me and raised me to my feet."
Daniel,8,19,"He said: “I am going to tell you what will happen later in the time of wrath, because the vision concerns the appointed time of the end."
Daniel,8,20,The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia.
Daniel,8,21,"The shaggy goat is the king of Greece, and the large horn between its eyes is the first king."
Daniel,8,22,The four horns that replaced the one that was broken off represent four kingdoms that will emerge from his nation but will not have the same power.
Daniel,8,23,"“In the latter part of their reign, when rebels have become completely wicked, a fierce-looking king, a master of intrigue, will arise."
Daniel,8,24,"He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy those who are mighty, the holy people."
Daniel,8,25,"He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. When they feel secure, he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power."
Daniel,8,26,"“The vision of the evenings and mornings that has been given you is true, but seal up the vision, for it concerns the distant future.”"
Daniel,8,27,"I, Daniel, was worn out. I lay exhausted for several days. Then I got up and went about the king’s business. I was appalled by the vision; it was beyond understanding."
Daniel,9,1,"In the first year of Darius son of Xerxes (a Mede by descent), who was made ruler over the Babylonian kingdom—"
Daniel,9,2,"in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood from the Scriptures, according to the word of the LORD given to Jeremiah the prophet, that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy years."
Daniel,9,3,"So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with him in prayer and petition, in fasting, and in sackcloth and ashes."
Daniel,9,4,"I prayed to the LORD my God and confessed: “Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and keep his commandments,"
Daniel,9,5,we have sinned and done wrong. We have been wicked and have rebelled; we have turned away from your commands and laws.
Daniel,9,6,"We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes and our ancestors, and to all the people of the land."
Daniel,9,7,"“Lord, you are righteous, but this day we are covered with shame—the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel, both near and far, in all the countries where you have scattered us because of our unfaithfulness to you."
Daniel,9,8,"We and our kings, our princes and our ancestors are covered with shame, LORD, because we have sinned against you."
Daniel,9,9,"The Lord our God is merciful and forgiving, even though we have rebelled against him;"
Daniel,9,10,we have not obeyed the LORD our God or kept the laws he gave us through his servants the prophets.
Daniel,9,11,"All Israel has transgressed your law and turned away, refusing to obey you. “Therefore the curses and sworn judgments written in the Law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured out on us, because we have sinned against you."
Daniel,9,12,You have fulfilled the words spoken against us and against our rulers by bringing on us great disaster. Under the whole heaven nothing has ever been done like what has been done to Jerusalem.
Daniel,9,13,"Just as it is written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come on us, yet we have not sought the favor of the LORD our God by turning from our sins and giving attention to your truth."
Daniel,9,14,"The LORD did not hesitate to bring the disaster on us, for the LORD our God is righteous in everything he does; yet we have not obeyed him."
Daniel,9,15,"“Now, Lord our God, who brought your people out of Egypt with a mighty hand and who made for yourself a name that endures to this day, we have sinned, we have done wrong."
Daniel,9,16,"Lord, in keeping with all your righteous acts, turn away your anger and your wrath from Jerusalem, your city, your holy hill. Our sins and the iniquities of our ancestors have made Jerusalem and your people an object of scorn to all those around us."
Daniel,9,17,"“Now, our God, hear the prayers and petitions of your servant. For your sake, Lord, look with favor on your desolate sanctuary."
Daniel,9,18,"Give ear, our God, and hear; open your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears your Name. We do not make requests of you because we are righteous, but because of your great mercy."
Daniel,9,19,"Lord, listen! Lord, forgive! Lord, hear and act! For your sake, my God, do not delay, because your city and your people bear your Name.”"
Daniel,9,20,"While I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and making my request to the LORD my God for his holy hill—"
Daniel,9,21,"while I was still in prayer, Gabriel, the man I had seen in the earlier vision, came to me in swift flight about the time of the evening sacrifice."
Daniel,9,22,"He instructed me and said to me, “Daniel, I have now come to give you insight and understanding."
Daniel,9,23,"As soon as you began to pray, a word went out, which I have come to tell you, for you are highly esteemed. Therefore, consider the word and understand the vision:"
Daniel,9,24,"“Seventy ‘sevens’ are decreed for your people and your holy city to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the Most Holy Place."
Daniel,9,25,"“Know and understand this: From the time the word goes out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One, the ruler, comes, there will be seven ‘sevens,’ and sixty-two ‘sevens.’ It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench, but in times of trouble."
Daniel,9,26,"After the sixty-two ‘sevens,’ the Anointed One will be put to death and will have nothing. The people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come like a flood: War will continue until the end, and desolations have been decreed."
Daniel,9,27,"He will confirm a covenant with many for one ‘seven.’ In the middle of the ‘seven’ he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And at the temple he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on him.”"
Daniel,10,1,"In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a revelation was given to Daniel (who was called Belteshazzar). Its message was true and it concerned a great war. The understanding of the message came to him in a vision."
Daniel,10,2,"At that time I, Daniel, mourned for three weeks."
Daniel,10,3,I ate no choice food; no meat or wine touched my lips; and I used no lotions at all until the three weeks were over.
Daniel,10,4,"On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river, the Tigris,"
Daniel,10,5,"I looked up and there before me was a man dressed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist."
Daniel,10,6,"His body was like topaz, his face like lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and his voice like the sound of a multitude."
Daniel,10,7,"I, Daniel, was the only one who saw the vision; those who were with me did not see it, but such terror overwhelmed them that they fled and hid themselves."
Daniel,10,8,"So I was left alone, gazing at this great vision; I had no strength left, my face turned deathly pale and I was helpless."
Daniel,10,9,"Then I heard him speaking, and as I listened to him, I fell into a deep sleep, my face to the ground."
Daniel,10,10,A hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees.
Daniel,10,11,"He said, “Daniel, you who are highly esteemed, consider carefully the words I am about to speak to you, and stand up, for I have now been sent to you.” And when he said this to me, I stood up trembling."
Daniel,10,12,"Then he continued, “Do not be afraid, Daniel. Since the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to them."
Daniel,10,13,"But the prince of the Persian kingdom resisted me twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, because I was detained there with the king of Persia."
Daniel,10,14,"Now I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the future, for the vision concerns a time yet to come.”"
Daniel,10,15,"While he was saying this to me, I bowed with my face toward the ground and was speechless."
Daniel,10,16,"Then one who looked like a man touched my lips, and I opened my mouth and began to speak. I said to the one standing before me, “I am overcome with anguish because of the vision, my lord, and I feel very weak."
Daniel,10,17,"How can I, your servant, talk with you, my lord? My strength is gone and I can hardly breathe.”"
Daniel,10,18,Again the one who looked like a man touched me and gave me strength.
Daniel,10,19,"“Do not be afraid, you who are highly esteemed,” he said. “Peace! Be strong now; be strong.” When he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, “Speak, my lord, since you have given me strength.”"
Daniel,10,20,"So he said, “Do you know why I have come to you? Soon I will return to fight against the prince of Persia, and when I go, the prince of Greece will come;"
Daniel,10,21,"but first I will tell you what is written in the Book of Truth. (No one supports me against them except Michael, your prince."
Daniel,11,1,"And in the first year of Darius the Mede, I took my stand to support and protect him.)"
Daniel,11,2,"“Now then, I tell you the truth: Three more kings will arise in Persia, and then a fourth, who will be far richer than all the others. When he has gained power by his wealth, he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece."
Daniel,11,3,"Then a mighty king will arise, who will rule with great power and do as he pleases."
Daniel,11,4,"After he has arisen, his empire will be broken up and parceled out toward the four winds of heaven. It will not go to his descendants, nor will it have the power he exercised, because his empire will be uprooted and given to others."
Daniel,11,5,"“The king of the South will become strong, but one of his commanders will become even stronger than he and will rule his own kingdom with great power."
Daniel,11,6,"After some years, they will become allies. The daughter of the king of the South will go to the king of the North to make an alliance, but she will not retain her power, and he and his power will not last. In those days she will be betrayed, together with her royal escort and her father and the one who supported her."
Daniel,11,7,“One from her family line will arise to take her place. He will attack the forces of the king of the North and enter his fortress; he will fight against them and be victorious.
Daniel,11,8,"He will also seize their gods, their metal images and their valuable articles of silver and gold and carry them off to Egypt. For some years he will leave the king of the North alone."
Daniel,11,9,Then the king of the North will invade the realm of the king of the South but will retreat to his own country.
Daniel,11,10,"His sons will prepare for war and assemble a great army, which will sweep on like an irresistible flood and carry the battle as far as his fortress."
Daniel,11,11,"“Then the king of the South will march out in a rage and fight against the king of the North, who will raise a large army, but it will be defeated."
Daniel,11,12,"When the army is carried off, the king of the South will be filled with pride and will slaughter many thousands, yet he will not remain triumphant."
Daniel,11,13,"For the king of the North will muster another army, larger than the first; and after several years, he will advance with a huge army fully equipped."
Daniel,11,14,"“In those times many will rise against the king of the South. Those who are violent among your own people will rebel in fulfillment of the vision, but without success."
Daniel,11,15,Then the king of the North will come and build up siege ramps and will capture a fortified city. The forces of the South will be powerless to resist; even their best troops will not have the strength to stand.
Daniel,11,16,The invader will do as he pleases; no one will be able to stand against him. He will establish himself in the Beautiful Land and will have the power to destroy it.
Daniel,11,17,"He will determine to come with the might of his entire kingdom and will make an alliance with the king of the South. And he will give him a daughter in marriage in order to overthrow the kingdom, but his plans will not succeed or help him."
Daniel,11,18,"Then he will turn his attention to the coastlands and will take many of them, but a commander will put an end to his insolence and will turn his insolence back on him."
Daniel,11,19,"After this, he will turn back toward the fortresses of his own country but will stumble and fall, to be seen no more."
Daniel,11,20,"“His successor will send out a tax collector to maintain the royal splendor. In a few years, however, he will be destroyed, yet not in anger or in battle."
Daniel,11,21,"“He will be succeeded by a contemptible person who has not been given the honor of royalty. He will invade the kingdom when its people feel secure, and he will seize it through intrigue."
Daniel,11,22,Then an overwhelming army will be swept away before him; both it and a prince of the covenant will be destroyed.
Daniel,11,23,"After coming to an agreement with him, he will act deceitfully, and with only a few people he will rise to power."
Daniel,11,24,"When the richest provinces feel secure, he will invade them and will achieve what neither his fathers nor his forefathers did. He will distribute plunder, loot and wealth among his followers. He will plot the overthrow of fortresses—but only for a time."
Daniel,11,25,"“With a large army he will stir up his strength and courage against the king of the South. The king of the South will wage war with a large and very powerful army, but he will not be able to stand because of the plots devised against him."
Daniel,11,26,"Those who eat from the king’s provisions will try to destroy him; his army will be swept away, and many will fall in battle."
Daniel,11,27,"The two kings, with their hearts bent on evil, will sit at the same table and lie to each other, but to no avail, because an end will still come at the appointed time."
Daniel,11,28,"The king of the North will return to his own country with great wealth, but his heart will be set against the holy covenant. He will take action against it and then return to his own country."
Daniel,11,29,"“At the appointed time he will invade the South again, but this time the outcome will be different from what it was before."
Daniel,11,30,"Ships of the western coastlands will oppose him, and he will lose heart. Then he will turn back and vent his fury against the holy covenant. He will return and show favor to those who forsake the holy covenant."
Daniel,11,31,“His armed forces will rise up to desecrate the temple fortress and will abolish the daily sacrifice. Then they will set up the abomination that causes desolation.
Daniel,11,32,"With flattery he will corrupt those who have violated the covenant, but the people who know their God will firmly resist him."
Daniel,11,33,"“Those who are wise will instruct many, though for a time they will fall by the sword or be burned or captured or plundered."
Daniel,11,34,"When they fall, they will receive a little help, and many who are not sincere will join them."
Daniel,11,35,"Some of the wise will stumble, so that they may be refined, purified and made spotless until the time of the end, for it will still come at the appointed time."
Daniel,11,36,"“The king will do as he pleases. He will exalt and magnify himself above every god and will say unheard-of things against the God of gods. He will be successful until the time of wrath is completed, for what has been determined must take place."
Daniel,11,37,"He will show no regard for the gods of his ancestors or for the one desired by women, nor will he regard any god, but will exalt himself above them all."
Daniel,11,38,"Instead of them, he will honor a god of fortresses; a god unknown to his ancestors he will honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly gifts."
Daniel,11,39,He will attack the mightiest fortresses with the help of a foreign god and will greatly honor those who acknowledge him. He will make them rulers over many people and will distribute the land at a price.
Daniel,11,40,"“At the time of the end the king of the South will engage him in battle, and the king of the North will storm out against him with chariots and cavalry and a great fleet of ships. He will invade many countries and sweep through them like a flood."
Daniel,11,41,"He will also invade the Beautiful Land. Many countries will fall, but Edom, Moab and the leaders of Ammon will be delivered from his hand."
Daniel,11,42,He will extend his power over many countries; Egypt will not escape.
Daniel,11,43,"He will gain control of the treasures of gold and silver and all the riches of Egypt, with the Libyans and Cushites in submission."
Daniel,11,44,"But reports from the east and the north will alarm him, and he will set out in a great rage to destroy and annihilate many."
Daniel,11,45,"He will pitch his royal tents between the seas at the beautiful holy mountain. Yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him."
Daniel,12,1,"“At that time Michael, the great prince who protects your people, will arise. There will be a time of distress such as has not happened from the beginning of nations until then. But at that time your people—everyone whose name is found written in the book—will be delivered."
Daniel,12,2,"Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt."
Daniel,12,3,"Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever."
Daniel,12,4,"But you, Daniel, roll up and seal the words of the scroll until the time of the end. Many will go here and there to increase knowledge.”"
Daniel,12,5,"Then I, Daniel, looked, and there before me stood two others, one on this bank of the river and one on the opposite bank."
Daniel,12,6,"One of them said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, “How long will it be before these astonishing things are fulfilled?”"
Daniel,12,7,"The man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, lifted his right hand and his left hand toward heaven, and I heard him swear by him who lives forever, saying, “It will be for a time, times and half a time. When the power of the holy people has been finally broken, all these things will be completed.”"
Daniel,12,8,"I heard, but I did not understand. So I asked, “My lord, what will the outcome of all this be?”"
Daniel,12,9,"He replied, “Go your way, Daniel, because the words are rolled up and sealed until the time of the end."
Daniel,12,10,"Many will be purified, made spotless and refined, but the wicked will continue to be wicked. None of the wicked will understand, but those who are wise will understand."
Daniel,12,11,"“From the time that the daily sacrifice is abolished and the abomination that causes desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days."
Daniel,12,12,"Blessed is the one who waits for and reaches the end of the 1,335 days."
Daniel,12,13,"“As for you, go your way till the end. You will rest, and then at the end of the days you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance.”"
Hosea,1,1,"The word of the LORD that came to Hosea son of Beeri during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the reign of Jeroboam son of Jehoash king of Israel:"
Hosea,1,2,"When the LORD began to speak through Hosea, the LORD said to him, “Go, marry a promiscuous woman and have children with her, for like an adulterous wife this land is guilty of unfaithfulness to the LORD.”"
Hosea,1,3,"So he married Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son."
Hosea,1,4,"Then the LORD said to Hosea, “Call him Jezreel, because I will soon punish the house of Jehu for the massacre at Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel."
Hosea,1,5,In that day I will break Israel’s bow in the Valley of Jezreel.”
Hosea,1,6,"Gomer conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. Then the LORD said to Hosea, “Call her Lo-Ruhamah (which means “not loved”), for I will no longer show love to Israel, that I should at all forgive them."
Hosea,1,7,"Yet I will show love to Judah; and I will save them—not by bow, sword or battle, or by horses and horsemen, but I, the LORD their God, will save them.”"
Hosea,1,8,"After she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, Gomer had another son."
Hosea,1,9,"Then the LORD said, “Call him Lo-Ammi (which means “not my people”), for you are not my people, and I am not your God."
Hosea,1,10,"“Yet the Israelites will be like the sand on the seashore, which cannot be measured or counted. In the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ they will be called ‘children of the living God.’"
Hosea,1,11,"The people of Judah and the people of Israel will come together; they will appoint one leader and will come up out of the land, for great will be the day of Jezreel."
Hosea,2,1,"“Say of your brothers, ‘My people,’ and of your sisters, ‘My loved one.’"
Hosea,2,2,"“Rebuke your mother, rebuke her, for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband. Let her remove the adulterous look from her face and the unfaithfulness from between her breasts."
Hosea,2,3,"Otherwise I will strip her naked and make her as bare as on the day she was born; I will make her like a desert, turn her into a parched land, and slay her with thirst."
Hosea,2,4,"I will not show my love to her children, because they are the children of adultery."
Hosea,2,5,"Their mother has been unfaithful and has conceived them in disgrace. She said, ‘I will go after my lovers, who give me my food and my water, my wool and my linen, my olive oil and my drink.’"
Hosea,2,6,Therefore I will block her path with thornbushes; I will wall her in so that she cannot find her way.
Hosea,2,7,"She will chase after her lovers but not catch them; she will look for them but not find them. Then she will say, ‘I will go back to my husband as at first, for then I was better off than now.’"
Hosea,2,8,"She has not acknowledged that I was the one who gave her the grain, the new wine and oil, who lavished on her the silver and gold— which they used for Baal."
Hosea,2,9,"“Therefore I will take away my grain when it ripens, and my new wine when it is ready. I will take back my wool and my linen, intended to cover her naked body."
Hosea,2,10,So now I will expose her lewdness before the eyes of her lovers; no one will take her out of my hands.
Hosea,2,11,"I will stop all her celebrations: her yearly festivals, her New Moons, her Sabbath days—all her appointed festivals."
Hosea,2,12,"I will ruin her vines and her fig trees, which she said were her pay from her lovers; I will make them a thicket, and wild animals will devour them."
Hosea,2,13,"I will punish her for the days she burned incense to the Baals; she decked herself with rings and jewelry, and went after her lovers, but me she forgot,” declares the LORD."
Hosea,2,14,“Therefore I am now going to allure her; I will lead her into the wilderness and speak tenderly to her.
Hosea,2,15,"There I will give her back her vineyards, and will make the Valley of Achor a door of hope. There she will respond as in the days of her youth, as in the day she came up out of Egypt."
Hosea,2,16,"“In that day,” declares the LORD, “you will call me ‘my husband’; you will no longer call me ‘my master.’"
Hosea,2,17,I will remove the names of the Baals from her lips; no longer will their names be invoked.
Hosea,2,18,"In that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, the birds in the sky and the creatures that move along the ground. Bow and sword and battle I will abolish from the land, so that all may lie down in safety."
Hosea,2,19,"I will betroth you to me forever; I will betroth you in righteousness and justice, in love and compassion."
Hosea,2,20,"I will betroth you in faithfulness, and you will acknowledge the LORD."
Hosea,2,21,"“In that day I will respond,” declares the LORD— “I will respond to the skies, and they will respond to the earth;"
Hosea,2,22,"and the earth will respond to the grain, the new wine and the olive oil, and they will respond to Jezreel."
Hosea,2,23,"I will plant her for myself in the land; I will show my love to the one I called ‘Not my loved one.’ I will say to those called ‘Not my people,’ ‘You are my people’; and they will say, ‘You are my God.’”"
Hosea,3,1,"The LORD said to me, “Go, show your love to your wife again, though she is loved by another man and is an adulteress. Love her as the LORD loves the Israelites, though they turn to other gods and love the sacred raisin cakes.”"
Hosea,3,2,So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and about a homer and a lethek of barley.
Hosea,3,3,"Then I told her, “You are to live with me many days; you must not be a prostitute or be intimate with any man, and I will behave the same way toward you.”"
Hosea,3,4,"For the Israelites will live many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred stones, without ephod or household gods."
Hosea,3,5,Afterward the Israelites will return and seek the LORD their God and David their king. They will come trembling to the LORD and to his blessings in the last days.
Hosea,4,1,"Hear the word of the LORD, you Israelites, because the LORD has a charge to bring against you who live in the land: “There is no faithfulness, no love, no acknowledgment of God in the land."
Hosea,4,2,"There is only cursing, lying and murder, stealing and adultery; they break all bounds, and bloodshed follows bloodshed."
Hosea,4,3,"Because of this the land dries up, and all who live in it waste away; the beasts of the field, the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea are swept away."
Hosea,4,4,"“But let no one bring a charge, let no one accuse another, for your people are like those who bring charges against a priest."
Hosea,4,5,"You stumble day and night, and the prophets stumble with you. So I will destroy your mother—"
Hosea,4,6,"my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge. “Because you have rejected knowledge, I also reject you as my priests; because you have ignored the law of your God, I also will ignore your children."
Hosea,4,7,"The more priests there were, the more they sinned against me; they exchanged their glorious God for something disgraceful."
Hosea,4,8,They feed on the sins of my people and relish their wickedness.
Hosea,4,9,"And it will be: Like people, like priests. I will punish both of them for their ways and repay them for their deeds."
Hosea,4,10,"“They will eat but not have enough; they will engage in prostitution but not flourish, because they have deserted the LORD to give themselves"
Hosea,4,11,to prostitution; old wine and new wine take away their understanding.
Hosea,4,12,"My people consult a wooden idol, and a diviner’s rod speaks to them. A spirit of prostitution leads them astray; they are unfaithful to their God."
Hosea,4,13,"They sacrifice on the mountaintops and burn offerings on the hills, under oak, poplar and terebinth, where the shade is pleasant. Therefore your daughters turn to prostitution and your daughters-in-law to adultery."
Hosea,4,14,"“I will not punish your daughters when they turn to prostitution, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery, because the men themselves consort with harlots and sacrifice with shrine prostitutes— a people without understanding will come to ruin!"
Hosea,4,15,"“Though you, Israel, commit adultery, do not let Judah become guilty. “Do not go to Gilgal; do not go up to Beth Aven. And do not swear, ‘As surely as the LORD lives!’"
Hosea,4,16,"The Israelites are stubborn, like a stubborn heifer. How then can the LORD pasture them like lambs in a meadow?"
Hosea,4,17,Ephraim is joined to idols; leave him alone!
Hosea,4,18,"Even when their drinks are gone, they continue their prostitution; their rulers dearly love shameful ways."
Hosea,4,19,"A whirlwind will sweep them away, and their sacrifices will bring them shame."
Hosea,5,1,"“Hear this, you priests! Pay attention, you Israelites! Listen, royal house! This judgment is against you: You have been a snare at Mizpah, a net spread out on Tabor."
Hosea,5,2,The rebels are knee-deep in slaughter. I will discipline all of them.
Hosea,5,3,"I know all about Ephraim; Israel is not hidden from me. Ephraim, you have now turned to prostitution; Israel is corrupt."
Hosea,5,4,“Their deeds do not permit them to return to their God. A spirit of prostitution is in their heart; they do not acknowledge the LORD.
Hosea,5,5,"Israel’s arrogance testifies against them; the Israelites, even Ephraim, stumble in their sin; Judah also stumbles with them."
Hosea,5,6,"When they go with their flocks and herds to seek the LORD, they will not find him; he has withdrawn himself from them."
Hosea,5,7,"They are unfaithful to the LORD; they give birth to illegitimate children. When they celebrate their New Moon feasts, he will devour their fields."
Hosea,5,8,"“Sound the trumpet in Gibeah, the horn in Ramah. Raise the battle cry in Beth Aven; lead on, Benjamin."
Hosea,5,9,Ephraim will be laid waste on the day of reckoning. Among the tribes of Israel I proclaim what is certain.
Hosea,5,10,Judah’s leaders are like those who move boundary stones. I will pour out my wrath on them like a flood of water.
Hosea,5,11,"Ephraim is oppressed, trampled in judgment, intent on pursuing idols."
Hosea,5,12,"I am like a moth to Ephraim, like rot to the people of Judah."
Hosea,5,13,"“When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his sores, then Ephraim turned to Assyria, and sent to the great king for help. But he is not able to cure you, not able to heal your sores."
Hosea,5,14,"For I will be like a lion to Ephraim, like a great lion to Judah. I will tear them to pieces and go away; I will carry them off, with no one to rescue them."
Hosea,5,15,Then I will return to my lair until they have borne their guilt and seek my face— in their misery they will earnestly seek me.”
Hosea,6,1,"“Come, let us return to the LORD. He has torn us to pieces but he will heal us; he has injured us but he will bind up our wounds."
Hosea,6,2,"After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will restore us, that we may live in his presence."
Hosea,6,3,"Let us acknowledge the LORD; let us press on to acknowledge him. As surely as the sun rises, he will appear; he will come to us like the winter rains, like the spring rains that water the earth.”"
Hosea,6,4,"“What can I do with you, Ephraim? What can I do with you, Judah? Your love is like the morning mist, like the early dew that disappears."
Hosea,6,5,"Therefore I cut you in pieces with my prophets, I killed you with the words of my mouth— then my judgments go forth like the sun."
Hosea,6,6,"For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and acknowledgment of God rather than burnt offerings."
Hosea,6,7,"As at Adam, they have broken the covenant; they were unfaithful to me there."
Hosea,6,8,"Gilead is a city of evildoers, stained with footprints of blood."
Hosea,6,9,"As marauders lie in ambush for a victim, so do bands of priests; they murder on the road to Shechem, carrying out their wicked schemes."
Hosea,6,10,"I have seen a horrible thing in Israel: There Ephraim is given to prostitution, Israel is defiled."
Hosea,6,11,"“Also for you, Judah, a harvest is appointed. “Whenever I would restore the fortunes of my people,"
Hosea,7,1,"whenever I would heal Israel, the sins of Ephraim are exposed and the crimes of Samaria revealed. They practice deceit, thieves break into houses, bandits rob in the streets;"
Hosea,7,2,but they do not realize that I remember all their evil deeds. Their sins engulf them; they are always before me.
Hosea,7,3,"“They delight the king with their wickedness, the princes with their lies."
Hosea,7,4,"They are all adulterers, burning like an oven whose fire the baker need not stir from the kneading of the dough till it rises."
Hosea,7,5,"On the day of the festival of our king the princes become inflamed with wine, and he joins hands with the mockers."
Hosea,7,6,Their hearts are like an oven; they approach him with intrigue. Their passion smolders all night; in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.
Hosea,7,7,"All of them are hot as an oven; they devour their rulers. All their kings fall, and none of them calls on me."
Hosea,7,8,“Ephraim mixes with the nations; Ephraim is a flat loaf not turned over.
Hosea,7,9,"Foreigners sap his strength, but he does not realize it. His hair is sprinkled with gray, but he does not notice."
Hosea,7,10,"Israel’s arrogance testifies against him, but despite all this he does not return to the LORD his God or search for him."
Hosea,7,11,"“Ephraim is like a dove, easily deceived and senseless— now calling to Egypt, now turning to Assyria."
Hosea,7,12,"When they go, I will throw my net over them; I will pull them down like the birds in the sky. When I hear them flocking together, I will catch them."
Hosea,7,13,"Woe to them, because they have strayed from me! Destruction to them, because they have rebelled against me! I long to redeem them but they speak about me falsely."
Hosea,7,14,"They do not cry out to me from their hearts but wail on their beds. They slash themselves, appealing to their gods for grain and new wine, but they turn away from me."
Hosea,7,15,"I trained them and strengthened their arms, but they plot evil against me."
Hosea,7,16,They do not turn to the Most High; they are like a faulty bow. Their leaders will fall by the sword because of their insolent words. For this they will be ridiculed in the land of Egypt.
Hosea,8,1,“Put the trumpet to your lips! An eagle is over the house of the LORD because the people have broken my covenant and rebelled against my law.
Hosea,8,2,"Israel cries out to me, ‘Our God, we acknowledge you!’"
Hosea,8,3,But Israel has rejected what is good; an enemy will pursue him.
Hosea,8,4,They set up kings without my consent; they choose princes without my approval. With their silver and gold they make idols for themselves to their own destruction.
Hosea,8,5,"Samaria, throw out your calf-idol! My anger burns against them. How long will they be incapable of purity?"
Hosea,8,6,"They are from Israel! This calf—a metalworker has made it; it is not God. It will be broken in pieces, that calf of Samaria."
Hosea,8,7,"“They sow the wind and reap the whirlwind. The stalk has no head; it will produce no flour. Were it to yield grain, foreigners would swallow it up."
Hosea,8,8,Israel is swallowed up; now she is among the nations like something no one wants.
Hosea,8,9,For they have gone up to Assyria like a wild donkey wandering alone. Ephraim has sold herself to lovers.
Hosea,8,10,"Although they have sold themselves among the nations, I will now gather them together. They will begin to waste away under the oppression of the mighty king."
Hosea,8,11,"“Though Ephraim built many altars for sin offerings, these have become altars for sinning."
Hosea,8,12,"I wrote for them the many things of my law, but they regarded them as something foreign."
Hosea,8,13,"Though they offer sacrifices as gifts to me, and though they eat the meat, the LORD is not pleased with them. Now he will remember their wickedness and punish their sins: They will return to Egypt."
Hosea,8,14,Israel has forgotten their Maker and built palaces; Judah has fortified many towns. But I will send fire on their cities that will consume their fortresses.”
Hosea,9,1,"Do not rejoice, Israel; do not be jubilant like the other nations. For you have been unfaithful to your God; you love the wages of a prostitute at every threshing floor."
Hosea,9,2,Threshing floors and winepresses will not feed the people; the new wine will fail them.
Hosea,9,3,They will not remain in the LORD’s land; Ephraim will return to Egypt and eat unclean food in Assyria.
Hosea,9,4,"They will not pour out wine offerings to the LORD, nor will their sacrifices please him. Such sacrifices will be to them like the bread of mourners; all who eat them will be unclean. This food will be for themselves; it will not come into the temple of the LORD."
Hosea,9,5,"What will you do on the day of your appointed festivals, on the feast days of the LORD?"
Hosea,9,6,"Even if they escape from destruction, Egypt will gather them, and Memphis will bury them. Their treasures of silver will be taken over by briers, and thorns will overrun their tents."
Hosea,9,7,"The days of punishment are coming, the days of reckoning are at hand. Let Israel know this. Because your sins are so many and your hostility so great, the prophet is considered a fool, the inspired person a maniac."
Hosea,9,8,"The prophet, along with my God, is the watchman over Ephraim, yet snares await him on all his paths, and hostility in the house of his God."
Hosea,9,9,"They have sunk deep into corruption, as in the days of Gibeah. God will remember their wickedness and punish them for their sins."
Hosea,9,10,"“When I found Israel, it was like finding grapes in the desert; when I saw your ancestors, it was like seeing the early fruit on the fig tree. But when they came to Baal Peor, they consecrated themselves to that shameful idol and became as vile as the thing they loved."
Hosea,9,11,"Ephraim’s glory will fly away like a bird— no birth, no pregnancy, no conception."
Hosea,9,12,"Even if they rear children, I will bereave them of every one. Woe to them when I turn away from them!"
Hosea,9,13,"I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place. But Ephraim will bring out their children to the slayer.”"
Hosea,9,14,"Give them, LORD— what will you give them? Give them wombs that miscarry and breasts that are dry."
Hosea,9,15,"“Because of all their wickedness in Gilgal, I hated them there. Because of their sinful deeds, I will drive them out of my house. I will no longer love them; all their leaders are rebellious."
Hosea,9,16,"Ephraim is blighted, their root is withered, they yield no fruit. Even if they bear children, I will slay their cherished offspring.”"
Hosea,9,17,My God will reject them because they have not obeyed him; they will be wanderers among the nations.
Hosea,10,1,"Israel was a spreading vine; he brought forth fruit for himself. As his fruit increased, he built more altars; as his land prospered, he adorned his sacred stones."
Hosea,10,2,"Their heart is deceitful, and now they must bear their guilt. The LORD will demolish their altars and destroy their sacred stones."
Hosea,10,3,"Then they will say, “We have no king because we did not revere the LORD. But even if we had a king, what could he do for us?”"
Hosea,10,4,"They make many promises, take false oaths and make agreements; therefore lawsuits spring up like poisonous weeds in a plowed field."
Hosea,10,5,"The people who live in Samaria fear for the calf-idol of Beth Aven. Its people will mourn over it, and so will its idolatrous priests, those who had rejoiced over its splendor, because it is taken from them into exile."
Hosea,10,6,It will be carried to Assyria as tribute for the great king. Ephraim will be disgraced; Israel will be ashamed of its foreign alliances.
Hosea,10,7,"Samaria’s king will be destroyed, swept away like a twig on the surface of the waters."
Hosea,10,8,"The high places of wickedness will be destroyed— it is the sin of Israel. Thorns and thistles will grow up and cover their altars. Then they will say to the mountains, “Cover us!” and to the hills, “Fall on us!”"
Hosea,10,9,"“Since the days of Gibeah, you have sinned, Israel, and there you have remained. Will not war again overtake the evildoers in Gibeah?"
Hosea,10,10,"When I please, I will punish them; nations will be gathered against them to put them in bonds for their double sin."
Hosea,10,11,"Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh; so I will put a yoke on her fair neck. I will drive Ephraim, Judah must plow, and Jacob must break up the ground."
Hosea,10,12,"Sow righteousness for yourselves, reap the fruit of unfailing love, and break up your unplowed ground; for it is time to seek the LORD, until he comes and showers his righteousness on you."
Hosea,10,13,"But you have planted wickedness, you have reaped evil, you have eaten the fruit of deception. Because you have depended on your own strength and on your many warriors,"
Hosea,10,14,"the roar of battle will rise against your people, so that all your fortresses will be devastated— as Shalman devastated Beth Arbel on the day of battle, when mothers were dashed to the ground with their children."
Hosea,10,15,"So will it happen to you, Bethel, because your wickedness is great. When that day dawns, the king of Israel will be completely destroyed."
Hosea,11,1,"“When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son."
Hosea,11,2,"But the more they were called, the more they went away from me. They sacrificed to the Baals and they burned incense to images."
Hosea,11,3,"It was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by the arms; but they did not realize it was I who healed them."
Hosea,11,4,"I led them with cords of human kindness, with ties of love. To them I was like one who lifts a little child to the cheek, and I bent down to feed them."
Hosea,11,5,“Will they not return to Egypt and will not Assyria rule over them because they refuse to repent?
Hosea,11,6,A sword will flash in their cities; it will devour their false prophets and put an end to their plans.
Hosea,11,7,"My people are determined to turn from me. Even though they call me God Most High, I will by no means exalt them."
Hosea,11,8,"“How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I treat you like Admah? How can I make you like Zeboyim? My heart is changed within me; all my compassion is aroused."
Hosea,11,9,"I will not carry out my fierce anger, nor will I devastate Ephraim again. For I am God, and not a man— the Holy One among you. I will not come against their cities."
Hosea,11,10,"They will follow the LORD; he will roar like a lion. When he roars, his children will come trembling from the west."
Hosea,11,11,"They will come from Egypt, trembling like sparrows, from Assyria, fluttering like doves. I will settle them in their homes,” declares the LORD."
Hosea,11,12,"Ephraim has surrounded me with lies, Israel with deceit. And Judah is unruly against God, even against the faithful Holy One."
Hosea,12,1,Ephraim feeds on the wind; he pursues the east wind all day and multiplies lies and violence. He makes a treaty with Assyria and sends olive oil to Egypt.
Hosea,12,2,The LORD has a charge to bring against Judah; he will punish Jacob according to his ways and repay him according to his deeds.
Hosea,12,3,In the womb he grasped his brother’s heel; as a man he struggled with God.
Hosea,12,4,He struggled with the angel and overcame him; he wept and begged for his favor. He found him at Bethel and talked with him there—
Hosea,12,5,"the LORD God Almighty, the LORD is his name!"
Hosea,12,6,"But you must return to your God; maintain love and justice, and wait for your God always."
Hosea,12,7,The merchant uses dishonest scales and loves to defraud.
Hosea,12,8,"Ephraim boasts, “I am very rich; I have become wealthy. With all my wealth they will not find in me any iniquity or sin.”"
Hosea,12,9,"“I have been the LORD your God ever since you came out of Egypt; I will make you live in tents again, as in the days of your appointed festivals."
Hosea,12,10,"I spoke to the prophets, gave them many visions and told parables through them.”"
Hosea,12,11,Is Gilead wicked? Its people are worthless! Do they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal? Their altars will be like piles of stones on a plowed field.
Hosea,12,12,"Jacob fled to the country of Aram; Israel served to get a wife, and to pay for her he tended sheep."
Hosea,12,13,"The LORD used a prophet to bring Israel up from Egypt, by a prophet he cared for him."
Hosea,12,14,But Ephraim has aroused his bitter anger; his Lord will leave on him the guilt of his bloodshed and will repay him for his contempt.
Hosea,13,1,"When Ephraim spoke, people trembled; he was exalted in Israel. But he became guilty of Baal worship and died."
Hosea,13,2,"Now they sin more and more; they make idols for themselves from their silver, cleverly fashioned images, all of them the work of craftsmen. It is said of these people, “They offer human sacrifices! They kiss calf-idols!”"
Hosea,13,3,"Therefore they will be like the morning mist, like the early dew that disappears, like chaff swirling from a threshing floor, like smoke escaping through a window."
Hosea,13,4,"“But I have been the LORD your God ever since you came out of Egypt. You shall acknowledge no God but me, no Savior except me."
Hosea,13,5,"I cared for you in the wilderness, in the land of burning heat."
Hosea,13,6,"When I fed them, they were satisfied; when they were satisfied, they became proud; then they forgot me."
Hosea,13,7,"So I will be like a lion to them, like a leopard I will lurk by the path."
Hosea,13,8,"Like a bear robbed of her cubs, I will attack them and rip them open; like a lion I will devour them— a wild animal will tear them apart."
Hosea,13,9,"“You are destroyed, Israel, because you are against me, against your helper."
Hosea,13,10,"Where is your king, that he may save you? Where are your rulers in all your towns, of whom you said, ‘Give me a king and princes’?"
Hosea,13,11,"So in my anger I gave you a king, and in my wrath I took him away."
Hosea,13,12,"The guilt of Ephraim is stored up, his sins are kept on record."
Hosea,13,13,"Pains as of a woman in childbirth come to him, but he is a child without wisdom; when the time arrives, he doesn’t have the sense to come out of the womb."
Hosea,13,14,"“I will deliver this people from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death. Where, O death, are your plagues? Where, O grave, is your destruction? “I will have no compassion,"
Hosea,13,15,"even though he thrives among his brothers. An east wind from the LORD will come, blowing in from the desert; his spring will fail and his well dry up. His storehouse will be plundered of all its treasures."
Hosea,13,16,"The people of Samaria must bear their guilt, because they have rebelled against their God. They will fall by the sword; their little ones will be dashed to the ground, their pregnant women ripped open.”"
Hosea,14,1,"Return, Israel, to the LORD your God. Your sins have been your downfall!"
Hosea,14,2,"Take words with you and return to the LORD. Say to him: “Forgive all our sins and receive us graciously, that we may offer the fruit of our lips."
Hosea,14,3,"Assyria cannot save us; we will not mount warhorses. We will never again say ‘Our gods’ to what our own hands have made, for in you the fatherless find compassion.”"
Hosea,14,4,"“I will heal their waywardness and love them freely, for my anger has turned away from them."
Hosea,14,5,I will be like the dew to Israel; he will blossom like a lily. Like a cedar of Lebanon he will send down his roots;
Hosea,14,6,"his young shoots will grow. His splendor will be like an olive tree, his fragrance like a cedar of Lebanon."
Hosea,14,7,"People will dwell again in his shade; they will flourish like the grain, they will blossom like the vine— Israel’s fame will be like the wine of Lebanon."
Hosea,14,8,"Ephraim, what more have I to do with idols? I will answer him and care for him. I am like a flourishing juniper; your fruitfulness comes from me.”"
Hosea,14,9,"Who is wise? Let them realize these things. Who is discerning? Let them understand. The ways of the LORD are right; the righteous walk in them, but the rebellious stumble in them."
Joel,1,1,The word of the LORD that came to Joel son of Pethuel.
Joel,1,2,"Hear this, you elders; listen, all who live in the land. Has anything like this ever happened in your days or in the days of your ancestors?"
Joel,1,3,"Tell it to your children, and let your children tell it to their children, and their children to the next generation."
Joel,1,4,What the locust swarm has left the great locusts have eaten; what the great locusts have left the young locusts have eaten; what the young locusts have left other locusts have eaten.
Joel,1,5,"Wake up, you drunkards, and weep! Wail, all you drinkers of wine; wail because of the new wine, for it has been snatched from your lips."
Joel,1,6,"A nation has invaded my land, a mighty army without number; it has the teeth of a lion, the fangs of a lioness."
Joel,1,7,"It has laid waste my vines and ruined my fig trees. It has stripped off their bark and thrown it away, leaving their branches white."
Joel,1,8,Mourn like a virgin in sackcloth grieving for the betrothed of her youth.
Joel,1,9,"Grain offerings and drink offerings are cut off from the house of the LORD. The priests are in mourning, those who minister before the LORD."
Joel,1,10,"The fields are ruined, the ground is dried up; the grain is destroyed, the new wine is dried up, the olive oil fails."
Joel,1,11,"Despair, you farmers, wail, you vine growers; grieve for the wheat and the barley, because the harvest of the field is destroyed."
Joel,1,12,"The vine is dried up and the fig tree is withered; the pomegranate, the palm and the apple tree— all the trees of the field—are dried up. Surely the people’s joy is withered away."
Joel,1,13,"Put on sackcloth, you priests, and mourn; wail, you who minister before the altar. Come, spend the night in sackcloth, you who minister before my God; for the grain offerings and drink offerings are withheld from the house of your God."
Joel,1,14,"Declare a holy fast; call a sacred assembly. Summon the elders and all who live in the land to the house of the LORD your God, and cry out to the LORD."
Joel,1,15,Alas for that day! For the day of the LORD is near; it will come like destruction from the Almighty.
Joel,1,16,Has not the food been cut off before our very eyes— joy and gladness from the house of our God?
Joel,1,17,"The seeds are shriveled beneath the clods. The storehouses are in ruins, the granaries have been broken down, for the grain has dried up."
Joel,1,18,How the cattle moan! The herds mill about because they have no pasture; even the flocks of sheep are suffering.
Joel,1,19,"To you, LORD, I call, for fire has devoured the pastures in the wilderness and flames have burned up all the trees of the field."
Joel,1,20,Even the wild animals pant for you; the streams of water have dried up and fire has devoured the pastures in the wilderness.
Joel,2,1,"Blow the trumpet in Zion; sound the alarm on my holy hill. Let all who live in the land tremble, for the day of the LORD is coming. It is close at hand—"
Joel,2,2,"a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness. Like dawn spreading across the mountains a large and mighty army comes, such as never was in ancient times nor ever will be in ages to come."
Joel,2,3,"Before them fire devours, behind them a flame blazes. Before them the land is like the garden of Eden, behind them, a desert waste— nothing escapes them."
Joel,2,4,They have the appearance of horses; they gallop along like cavalry.
Joel,2,5,"With a noise like that of chariots they leap over the mountaintops, like a crackling fire consuming stubble, like a mighty army drawn up for battle."
Joel,2,6,"At the sight of them, nations are in anguish; every face turns pale."
Joel,2,7,"They charge like warriors; they scale walls like soldiers. They all march in line, not swerving from their course."
Joel,2,8,They do not jostle each other; each marches straight ahead. They plunge through defenses without breaking ranks.
Joel,2,9,They rush upon the city; they run along the wall. They climb into the houses; like thieves they enter through the windows.
Joel,2,10,"Before them the earth shakes, the heavens tremble, the sun and moon are darkened, and the stars no longer shine."
Joel,2,11,"The LORD thunders at the head of his army; his forces are beyond number, and mighty is the army that obeys his command. The day of the LORD is great; it is dreadful. Who can endure it?"
Joel,2,12,"“Even now,” declares the LORD, “return to me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning.”"
Joel,2,13,"Rend your heart and not your garments. Return to the LORD your God, for he is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love, and he relents from sending calamity."
Joel,2,14,Who knows? He may turn and relent and leave behind a blessing— grain offerings and drink offerings for the LORD your God.
Joel,2,15,"Blow the trumpet in Zion, declare a holy fast, call a sacred assembly."
Joel,2,16,"Gather the people, consecrate the assembly; bring together the elders, gather the children, those nursing at the breast. Let the bridegroom leave his room and the bride her chamber."
Joel,2,17,"Let the priests, who minister before the LORD, weep between the portico and the altar. Let them say, “Spare your people, LORD. Do not make your inheritance an object of scorn, a byword among the nations. Why should they say among the peoples, ‘Where is their God?’”"
Joel,2,18,Then the LORD was jealous for his land and took pity on his people.
Joel,2,19,"The LORD replied to them: “I am sending you grain, new wine and olive oil, enough to satisfy you fully; never again will I make you an object of scorn to the nations."
Joel,2,20,"“I will drive the northern horde far from you, pushing it into a parched and barren land; its eastern ranks will drown in the Dead Sea and its western ranks in the Mediterranean Sea. And its stench will go up; its smell will rise.” Surely he has done great things!"
Joel,2,21,"Do not be afraid, land of Judah; be glad and rejoice. Surely the LORD has done great things!"
Joel,2,22,"Do not be afraid, you wild animals, for the pastures in the wilderness are becoming green. The trees are bearing their fruit; the fig tree and the vine yield their riches."
Joel,2,23,"Be glad, people of Zion, rejoice in the LORD your God, for he has given you the autumn rains because he is faithful. He sends you abundant showers, both autumn and spring rains, as before."
Joel,2,24,The threshing floors will be filled with grain; the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.
Joel,2,25,"“I will repay you for the years the locusts have eaten— the great locust and the young locust, the other locusts and the locust swarm— my great army that I sent among you."
Joel,2,26,"You will have plenty to eat, until you are full, and you will praise the name of the LORD your God, who has worked wonders for you; never again will my people be shamed."
Joel,2,27,"Then you will know that I am in Israel, that I am the LORD your God, and that there is no other; never again will my people be shamed."
Joel,2,28,"“And afterward, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions."
Joel,2,29,"Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days."
Joel,2,30,"I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and billows of smoke."
Joel,2,31,The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD.
Joel,2,32,"And everyone who calls on the name of the LORD will be saved; for on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be deliverance, as the LORD has said, even among the survivors whom the LORD calls."
Joel,3,1,"“In those days and at that time, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,"
Joel,3,2,"I will gather all nations and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. There I will put them on trial for what they did to my inheritance, my people Israel, because they scattered my people among the nations and divided up my land."
Joel,3,3,They cast lots for my people and traded boys for prostitutes; they sold girls for wine to drink.
Joel,3,4,"“Now what have you against me, Tyre and Sidon and all you regions of Philistia? Are you repaying me for something I have done? If you are paying me back, I will swiftly and speedily return on your own heads what you have done."
Joel,3,5,For you took my silver and my gold and carried off my finest treasures to your temples.
Joel,3,6,"You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks, that you might send them far from their homeland."
Joel,3,7,"“See, I am going to rouse them out of the places to which you sold them, and I will return on your own heads what you have done."
Joel,3,8,"I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, a nation far away.” The LORD has spoken."
Joel,3,9,Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare for war! Rouse the warriors! Let all the fighting men draw near and attack.
Joel,3,10,"Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears. Let the weakling say, “I am strong!”"
Joel,3,11,"Come quickly, all you nations from every side, and assemble there. Bring down your warriors, LORD!"
Joel,3,12,"“Let the nations be roused; let them advance into the Valley of Jehoshaphat, for there I will sit to judge all the nations on every side."
Joel,3,13,"Swing the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, trample the grapes, for the winepress is full and the vats overflow— so great is their wickedness!”"
Joel,3,14,"Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision."
Joel,3,15,"The sun and moon will be darkened, and the stars no longer shine."
Joel,3,16,"The LORD will roar from Zion and thunder from Jerusalem; the earth and the heavens will tremble. But the LORD will be a refuge for his people, a stronghold for the people of Israel."
Joel,3,17,"“Then you will know that I, the LORD your God, dwell in Zion, my holy hill. Jerusalem will be holy; never again will foreigners invade her."
Joel,3,18,"“In that day the mountains will drip new wine, and the hills will flow with milk; all the ravines of Judah will run with water. A fountain will flow out of the LORD’s house and will water the valley of acacias."
Joel,3,19,"But Egypt will be desolate, Edom a desert waste, because of violence done to the people of Judah, in whose land they shed innocent blood."
Joel,3,20,Judah will be inhabited forever and Jerusalem through all generations.
Joel,3,21,"Shall I leave their innocent blood unavenged? No, I will not.” The LORD dwells in Zion!"
Amos,1,1,"The words of Amos, one of the shepherds of Tekoa—the vision he saw concerning Israel two years before the earthquake, when Uzziah was king of Judah and Jeroboam son of Jehoash was king of Israel."
Amos,1,2,"He said: “The LORD roars from Zion and thunders from Jerusalem; the pastures of the shepherds dry up, and the top of Carmel withers.”"
Amos,1,3,"This is what the LORD says: “For three sins of Damascus, even for four, I will not relent. Because she threshed Gilead with sledges having iron teeth,"
Amos,1,4,I will send fire on the house of Hazael that will consume the fortresses of Ben-Hadad.
Amos,1,5,"I will break down the gate of Damascus; I will destroy the king who is in the Valley of Aven and the one who holds the scepter in Beth Eden. The people of Aram will go into exile to Kir,” says the LORD."
Amos,1,6,"This is what the LORD says: “For three sins of Gaza, even for four, I will not relent. Because she took captive whole communities and sold them to Edom,"
Amos,1,7,I will send fire on the walls of Gaza that will consume her fortresses.
Amos,1,8,"I will destroy the king of Ashdod and the one who holds the scepter in Ashkelon. I will turn my hand against Ekron, till the last of the Philistines are dead,” says the Sovereign LORD."
Amos,1,9,"This is what the LORD says: “For three sins of Tyre, even for four, I will not relent. Because she sold whole communities of captives to Edom, disregarding a treaty of brotherhood,"
Amos,1,10,I will send fire on the walls of Tyre that will consume her fortresses.”
Amos,1,11,"This is what the LORD says: “For three sins of Edom, even for four, I will not relent. Because he pursued his brother with a sword and slaughtered the women of the land, because his anger raged continually and his fury flamed unchecked,"
Amos,1,12,I will send fire on Teman that will consume the fortresses of Bozrah.”
Amos,1,13,"This is what the LORD says: “For three sins of Ammon, even for four, I will not relent. Because he ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead in order to extend his borders,"
Amos,1,14,"I will set fire to the walls of Rabbah that will consume her fortresses amid war cries on the day of battle, amid violent winds on a stormy day."
Amos,1,15,"Her king will go into exile, he and his officials together,” says the LORD."
Amos,2,1,"This is what the LORD says: “For three sins of Moab, even for four, I will not relent. Because he burned to ashes the bones of Edom’s king,"
Amos,2,2,I will send fire on Moab that will consume the fortresses of Kerioth. Moab will go down in great tumult amid war cries and the blast of the trumpet.
Amos,2,3,"I will destroy her ruler and kill all her officials with him,” says the LORD."
Amos,2,4,"This is what the LORD says: “For three sins of Judah, even for four, I will not relent. Because they have rejected the law of the LORD and have not kept his decrees, because they have been led astray by false gods, the gods their ancestors followed,"
Amos,2,5,I will send fire on Judah that will consume the fortresses of Jerusalem.”
Amos,2,6,"This is what the LORD says: “For three sins of Israel, even for four, I will not relent. They sell the innocent for silver, and the needy for a pair of sandals."
Amos,2,7,They trample on the heads of the poor as on the dust of the ground and deny justice to the oppressed. Father and son use the same girl and so profane my holy name.
Amos,2,8,They lie down beside every altar on garments taken in pledge. In the house of their god they drink wine taken as fines.
Amos,2,9,"“Yet I destroyed the Amorites before them, though they were tall as the cedars and strong as the oaks. I destroyed their fruit above and their roots below."
Amos,2,10,I brought you up out of Egypt and led you forty years in the wilderness to give you the land of the Amorites.
Amos,2,11,"“I also raised up prophets from among your children and Nazirites from among your youths. Is this not true, people of Israel?” declares the LORD."
Amos,2,12,“But you made the Nazirites drink wine and commanded the prophets not to prophesy.
Amos,2,13,"“Now then, I will crush you as a cart crushes when loaded with grain."
Amos,2,14,"The swift will not escape, the strong will not muster their strength, and the warrior will not save his life."
Amos,2,15,"The archer will not stand his ground, the fleet-footed soldier will not get away, and the horseman will not save his life."
Amos,2,16,"Even the bravest warriors will flee naked on that day,” declares the LORD."
Amos,3,1,"Hear this word, people of Israel, the word the LORD has spoken against you—against the whole family I brought up out of Egypt:"
Amos,3,2,“You only have I chosen of all the families of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your sins.”
Amos,3,3,Do two walk together unless they have agreed to do so?
Amos,3,4,Does a lion roar in the thicket when it has no prey? Does it growl in its den when it has caught nothing?
Amos,3,5,Does a bird swoop down to a trap on the ground when no bait is there? Does a trap spring up from the ground if it has not caught anything?
Amos,3,6,"When a trumpet sounds in a city, do not the people tremble? When disaster comes to a city, has not the LORD caused it?"
Amos,3,7,Surely the Sovereign LORD does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.
Amos,3,8,The lion has roared— who will not fear? The Sovereign LORD has spoken— who can but prophesy?
Amos,3,9,Proclaim to the fortresses of Ashdod and to the fortresses of Egypt: “Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria; see the great unrest within her and the oppression among her people.”
Amos,3,10,"“They do not know how to do right,” declares the LORD, “who store up in their fortresses what they have plundered and looted.”"
Amos,3,11,"Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: “An enemy will overrun your land, pull down your strongholds and plunder your fortresses.”"
Amos,3,12,"This is what the LORD says: “As a shepherd rescues from the lion’s mouth only two leg bones or a piece of an ear, so will the Israelites living in Samaria be rescued, with only the head of a bed and a piece of fabric from a couch.”"
Amos,3,13,"“Hear this and testify against the descendants of Jacob,” declares the Lord, the LORD God Almighty."
Amos,3,14,"“On the day I punish Israel for her sins, I will destroy the altars of Bethel; the horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground."
Amos,3,15,"I will tear down the winter house along with the summer house; the houses adorned with ivory will be destroyed and the mansions will be demolished,” declares the LORD."
Amos,4,1,"Hear this word, you cows of Bashan on Mount Samaria, you women who oppress the poor and crush the needy and say to your husbands, “Bring us some drinks!”"
Amos,4,2,"The Sovereign LORD has sworn by his holiness: “The time will surely come when you will be taken away with hooks, the last of you with fishhooks."
Amos,4,3,"You will each go straight out through breaches in the wall, and you will be cast out toward Harmon,” declares the LORD."
Amos,4,4,"“Go to Bethel and sin; go to Gilgal and sin yet more. Bring your sacrifices every morning, your tithes every three years."
Amos,4,5,"Burn leavened bread as a thank offering and brag about your freewill offerings— boast about them, you Israelites, for this is what you love to do,” declares the Sovereign LORD."
Amos,4,6,"“I gave you empty stomachs in every city and lack of bread in every town, yet you have not returned to me,” declares the LORD."
Amos,4,7,"“I also withheld rain from you when the harvest was still three months away. I sent rain on one town, but withheld it from another. One field had rain; another had none and dried up."
Amos,4,8,"People staggered from town to town for water but did not get enough to drink, yet you have not returned to me,” declares the LORD."
Amos,4,9,"“Many times I struck your gardens and vineyards, destroying them with blight and mildew. Locusts devoured your fig and olive trees, yet you have not returned to me,” declares the LORD."
Amos,4,10,"“I sent plagues among you as I did to Egypt. I killed your young men with the sword, along with your captured horses. I filled your nostrils with the stench of your camps, yet you have not returned to me,” declares the LORD."
Amos,4,11,"“I overthrew some of you as I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. You were like a burning stick snatched from the fire, yet you have not returned to me,” declares the LORD."
Amos,4,12,"“Therefore this is what I will do to you, Israel, and because I will do this to you, Israel, prepare to meet your God.”"
Amos,4,13,"He who forms the mountains, who creates the wind, and who reveals his thoughts to mankind, who turns dawn to darkness, and treads on the heights of the earth— the LORD God Almighty is his name."
Amos,5,1,"Hear this word, Israel, this lament I take up concerning you:"
Amos,5,2,"“Fallen is Virgin Israel, never to rise again, deserted in her own land, with no one to lift her up.”"
Amos,5,3,This is what the Sovereign LORD says to Israel: “Your city that marches out a thousand strong will have only a hundred left; your town that marches out a hundred strong will have only ten left.”
Amos,5,4,This is what the LORD says to Israel: “Seek me and live;
Amos,5,5,"do not seek Bethel, do not go to Gilgal, do not journey to Beersheba. For Gilgal will surely go into exile, and Bethel will be reduced to nothing.”"
Amos,5,6,"Seek the LORD and live, or he will sweep through the tribes of Joseph like a fire; it will devour them, and Bethel will have no one to quench it."
Amos,5,7,There are those who turn justice into bitterness and cast righteousness to the ground.
Amos,5,8,"He who made the Pleiades and Orion, who turns midnight into dawn and darkens day into night, who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out over the face of the land— the LORD is his name."
Amos,5,9,With a blinding flash he destroys the stronghold and brings the fortified city to ruin.
Amos,5,10,There are those who hate the one who upholds justice in court and detest the one who tells the truth.
Amos,5,11,"You levy a straw tax on the poor and impose a tax on their grain. Therefore, though you have built stone mansions, you will not live in them; though you have planted lush vineyards, you will not drink their wine."
Amos,5,12,For I know how many are your offenses and how great your sins. There are those who oppress the innocent and take bribes and deprive the poor of justice in the courts.
Amos,5,13,"Therefore the prudent keep quiet in such times, for the times are evil."
Amos,5,14,"Seek good, not evil, that you may live. Then the LORD God Almighty will be with you, just as you say he is."
Amos,5,15,"Hate evil, love good; maintain justice in the courts. Perhaps the LORD God Almighty will have mercy on the remnant of Joseph."
Amos,5,16,"Therefore this is what the Lord, the LORD God Almighty, says: “There will be wailing in all the streets and cries of anguish in every public square. The farmers will be summoned to weep and the mourners to wail."
Amos,5,17,"There will be wailing in all the vineyards, for I will pass through your midst,” says the LORD."
Amos,5,18,"Woe to you who long for the day of the LORD! Why do you long for the day of the LORD? That day will be darkness, not light."
Amos,5,19,"It will be as though a man fled from a lion only to meet a bear, as though he entered his house and rested his hand on the wall only to have a snake bite him."
Amos,5,20,"Will not the day of the LORD be darkness, not light— pitch-dark, without a ray of brightness?"
Amos,5,21,"“I hate, I despise your religious festivals; your assemblies are a stench to me."
Amos,5,22,"Even though you bring me burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them. Though you bring choice fellowship offerings, I will have no regard for them."
Amos,5,23,Away with the noise of your songs! I will not listen to the music of your harps.
Amos,5,24,"But let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream!"
Amos,5,25,"“Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings forty years in the wilderness, people of Israel?"
Amos,5,26,"You have lifted up the shrine of your king, the pedestal of your idols, the star of your god— which you made for yourselves."
Amos,5,27,"Therefore I will send you into exile beyond Damascus,” says the LORD, whose name is God Almighty."
Amos,6,1,"Woe to you who are complacent in Zion, and to you who feel secure on Mount Samaria, you notable men of the foremost nation, to whom the people of Israel come!"
Amos,6,2,"Go to Kalneh and look at it; go from there to great Hamath, and then go down to Gath in Philistia. Are they better off than your two kingdoms? Is their land larger than yours?"
Amos,6,3,You put off the day of disaster and bring near a reign of terror.
Amos,6,4,You lie on beds adorned with ivory and lounge on your couches. You dine on choice lambs and fattened calves.
Amos,6,5,You strum away on your harps like David and improvise on musical instruments.
Amos,6,6,"You drink wine by the bowlful and use the finest lotions, but you do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph."
Amos,6,7,Therefore you will be among the first to go into exile; your feasting and lounging will end.
Amos,6,8,The Sovereign LORD has sworn by himself—the LORD God Almighty declares: “I abhor the pride of Jacob and detest his fortresses; I will deliver up the city and everything in it.”
Amos,6,9,"If ten people are left in one house, they too will die."
Amos,6,10,"And if the relative who comes to carry the bodies out of the house to burn them asks anyone who might be hiding there, “Is anyone else with you?” and he says, “No,” then he will go on to say, “Hush! We must not mention the name of the LORD.”"
Amos,6,11,"For the LORD has given the command, and he will smash the great house into pieces and the small house into bits."
Amos,6,12,Do horses run on the rocky crags? Does one plow the sea with oxen? But you have turned justice into poison and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness—
Amos,6,13,"you who rejoice in the conquest of Lo Debar and say, “Did we not take Karnaim by our own strength?”"
Amos,6,14,"For the LORD God Almighty declares, “I will stir up a nation against you, Israel, that will oppress you all the way from Lebo Hamath to the valley of the Arabah.”"
Amos,7,1,This is what the Sovereign LORD showed me: He was preparing swarms of locusts after the king’s share had been harvested and just as the late crops were coming up.
Amos,7,2,"When they had stripped the land clean, I cried out, “Sovereign LORD, forgive! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!”"
Amos,7,3,"So the LORD relented. “This will not happen,” the LORD said."
Amos,7,4,This is what the Sovereign LORD showed me: The Sovereign LORD was calling for judgment by fire; it dried up the great deep and devoured the land.
Amos,7,5,"Then I cried out, “Sovereign LORD, I beg you, stop! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!”"
Amos,7,6,"So the LORD relented. “This will not happen either,” the Sovereign LORD said."
Amos,7,7,"This is what he showed me: The Lord was standing by a wall that had been built true to plumb, with a plumb line in his hand."
Amos,7,8,"And the LORD asked me, “What do you see, Amos?” “A plumb line,” I replied. Then the Lord said, “Look, I am setting a plumb line among my people Israel; I will spare them no longer."
Amos,7,9,“The high places of Isaac will be destroyed and the sanctuaries of Israel will be ruined; with my sword I will rise against the house of Jeroboam.”
Amos,7,10,Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent a message to Jeroboam king of Israel: “Amos is raising a conspiracy against you in the very heart of Israel. The land cannot bear all his words.
Amos,7,11,"For this is what Amos is saying: “‘Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will surely go into exile, away from their native land.’”"
Amos,7,12,"Then Amaziah said to Amos, “Get out, you seer! Go back to the land of Judah. Earn your bread there and do your prophesying there."
Amos,7,13,"Don’t prophesy anymore at Bethel, because this is the king’s sanctuary and the temple of the kingdom.”"
Amos,7,14,"Amos answered Amaziah, “I was neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet, but I was a shepherd, and I also took care of sycamore-fig trees."
Amos,7,15,"But the LORD took me from tending the flock and said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’"
Amos,7,16,"Now then, hear the word of the LORD. You say, “‘Do not prophesy against Israel, and stop preaching against the descendants of Isaac.’"
Amos,7,17,"“Therefore this is what the LORD says: “‘Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, and your sons and daughters will fall by the sword. Your land will be measured and divided up, and you yourself will die in a pagan country. And Israel will surely go into exile, away from their native land.’”"
Amos,8,1,This is what the Sovereign LORD showed me: a basket of ripe fruit.
Amos,8,2,"“What do you see, Amos?” he asked. “A basket of ripe fruit,” I answered. Then the LORD said to me, “The time is ripe for my people Israel; I will spare them no longer."
Amos,8,3,"“In that day,” declares the Sovereign LORD, “the songs in the temple will turn to wailing. Many, many bodies—flung everywhere! Silence!”"
Amos,8,4,"Hear this, you who trample the needy and do away with the poor of the land,"
Amos,8,5,"saying, “When will the New Moon be over that we may sell grain, and the Sabbath be ended that we may market wheat?”— skimping on the measure, boosting the price and cheating with dishonest scales,"
Amos,8,6,"buying the poor with silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, selling even the sweepings with the wheat."
Amos,8,7,"The LORD has sworn by himself, the Pride of Jacob: “I will never forget anything they have done."
Amos,8,8,"“Will not the land tremble for this, and all who live in it mourn? The whole land will rise like the Nile; it will be stirred up and then sink like the river of Egypt."
Amos,8,9,"“In that day,” declares the Sovereign LORD, “I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight."
Amos,8,10,I will turn your religious festivals into mourning and all your singing into weeping. I will make all of you wear sackcloth and shave your heads. I will make that time like mourning for an only son and the end of it like a bitter day.
Amos,8,11,"“The days are coming,” declares the Sovereign LORD, “when I will send a famine through the land— not a famine of food or a thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the words of the LORD."
Amos,8,12,"People will stagger from sea to sea and wander from north to east, searching for the word of the LORD, but they will not find it."
Amos,8,13,“In that day “the lovely young women and strong young men will faint because of thirst.
Amos,8,14,"Those who swear by the sin of Samaria— who say, ‘As surely as your god lives, Dan,’ or, ‘As surely as the god of Beersheba lives’— they will fall, never to rise again.”"
Amos,9,1,"I saw the Lord standing by the altar, and he said: “Strike the tops of the pillars so that the thresholds shake. Bring them down on the heads of all the people; those who are left I will kill with the sword. Not one will get away, none will escape."
Amos,9,2,"Though they dig down to the depths below, from there my hand will take them. Though they climb up to the heavens above, from there I will bring them down."
Amos,9,3,"Though they hide themselves on the top of Carmel, there I will hunt them down and seize them. Though they hide from my eyes at the bottom of the sea, there I will command the serpent to bite them."
Amos,9,4,"Though they are driven into exile by their enemies, there I will command the sword to slay them. “I will keep my eye on them for harm and not for good.”"
Amos,9,5,"The Lord, the LORD Almighty— he touches the earth and it melts, and all who live in it mourn; the whole land rises like the Nile, then sinks like the river of Egypt;"
Amos,9,6,he builds his lofty palace in the heavens and sets its foundation on the earth; he calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out over the face of the land— the LORD is his name.
Amos,9,7,"“Are not you Israelites the same to me as the Cushites?” declares the LORD. “Did I not bring Israel up from Egypt, the Philistines from Caphtor and the Arameans from Kir?"
Amos,9,8,"“Surely the eyes of the Sovereign LORD are on the sinful kingdom. I will destroy it from the face of the earth. Yet I will not totally destroy the descendants of Jacob,” declares the LORD."
Amos,9,9,"“For I will give the command, and I will shake the people of Israel among all the nations as grain is shaken in a sieve, and not a pebble will reach the ground."
Amos,9,10,"All the sinners among my people will die by the sword, all those who say, ‘Disaster will not overtake or meet us.’"
Amos,9,11,"“In that day “I will restore David’s fallen shelter— I will repair its broken walls and restore its ruins— and will rebuild it as it used to be,"
Amos,9,12,"so that they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations that bear my name,” declares the LORD, who will do these things."
Amos,9,13,"“The days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when the reaper will be overtaken by the plowman and the planter by the one treading grapes. New wine will drip from the mountains and flow from all the hills,"
Amos,9,14,and I will bring my people Israel back from exile. “They will rebuild the ruined cities and live in them. They will plant vineyards and drink their wine; they will make gardens and eat their fruit.
Amos,9,15,"I will plant Israel in their own land, never again to be uprooted from the land I have given them,” says the LORD your God."
Obadiah,1,1,"The vision of Obadiah. This is what the Sovereign LORD says about Edom— We have heard a message from the LORD: An envoy was sent to the nations to say, “Rise, let us go against her for battle”—"
Obadiah,1,2,"“See, I will make you small among the nations; you will be utterly despised."
Obadiah,1,3,"The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who live in the clefts of the rocks and make your home on the heights, you who say to yourself, ‘Who can bring me down to the ground?’"
Obadiah,1,4,"Though you soar like the eagle and make your nest among the stars, from there I will bring you down,” declares the LORD."
Obadiah,1,5,"“If thieves came to you, if robbers in the night— oh, what a disaster awaits you!— would they not steal only as much as they wanted? If grape pickers came to you, would they not leave a few grapes?"
Obadiah,1,6,"But how Esau will be ransacked, his hidden treasures pillaged!"
Obadiah,1,7,"All your allies will force you to the border; your friends will deceive and overpower you; those who eat your bread will set a trap for you, but you will not detect it."
Obadiah,1,8,"“In that day,” declares the LORD, “will I not destroy the wise men of Edom, those of understanding in the mountains of Esau?"
Obadiah,1,9,"Your warriors, Teman, will be terrified, and everyone in Esau’s mountains will be cut down in the slaughter."
Obadiah,1,10,"Because of the violence against your brother Jacob, you will be covered with shame; you will be destroyed forever."
Obadiah,1,11,"On the day you stood aloof while strangers carried off his wealth and foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem, you were like one of them."
Obadiah,1,12,"You should not gloat over your brother in the day of his misfortune, nor rejoice over the people of Judah in the day of their destruction, nor boast so much in the day of their trouble."
Obadiah,1,13,"You should not march through the gates of my people in the day of their disaster, nor gloat over them in their calamity in the day of their disaster, nor seize their wealth in the day of their disaster."
Obadiah,1,14,"You should not wait at the crossroads to cut down their fugitives, nor hand over their survivors in the day of their trouble."
Obadiah,1,15,"“The day of the LORD is near for all nations. As you have done, it will be done to you; your deeds will return upon your own head."
Obadiah,1,16,"Just as you drank on my holy hill, so all the nations will drink continually; they will drink and drink and be as if they had never been."
Obadiah,1,17,"But on Mount Zion will be deliverance; it will be holy, and Jacob will possess his inheritance."
Obadiah,1,18,"Jacob will be a fire and Joseph a flame; Esau will be stubble, and they will set him on fire and destroy him. There will be no survivors from Esau.” The LORD has spoken."
Obadiah,1,19,"People from the Negev will occupy the mountains of Esau, and people from the foothills will possess the land of the Philistines. They will occupy the fields of Ephraim and Samaria, and Benjamin will possess Gilead."
Obadiah,1,20,This company of Israelite exiles who are in Canaan will possess the land as far as Zarephath; the exiles from Jerusalem who are in Sepharad will possess the towns of the Negev.
Obadiah,1,21,Deliverers will go up on Mount Zion to govern the mountains of Esau. And the kingdom will be the LORD’s.
Jonah,1,1,The word of the LORD came to Jonah son of Amittai:
Jonah,1,2,"“Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it, because its wickedness has come up before me.”"
Jonah,1,3,"But Jonah ran away from the LORD and headed for Tarshish. He went down to Joppa, where he found a ship bound for that port. After paying the fare, he went aboard and sailed for Tarshish to flee from the LORD."
Jonah,1,4,"Then the LORD sent a great wind on the sea, and such a violent storm arose that the ship threatened to break up."
Jonah,1,5,"All the sailors were afraid and each cried out to his own god. And they threw the cargo into the sea to lighten the ship. But Jonah had gone below deck, where he lay down and fell into a deep sleep."
Jonah,1,6,"The captain went to him and said, “How can you sleep? Get up and call on your god! Maybe he will take notice of us so that we will not perish.”"
Jonah,1,7,"Then the sailors said to each other, “Come, let us cast lots to find out who is responsible for this calamity.” They cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah."
Jonah,1,8,"So they asked him, “Tell us, who is responsible for making all this trouble for us? What kind of work do you do? Where do you come from? What is your country? From what people are you?”"
Jonah,1,9,"He answered, “I am a Hebrew and I worship the LORD, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.”"
Jonah,1,10,"This terrified them and they asked, “What have you done?” (They knew he was running away from the LORD, because he had already told them so.)"
Jonah,1,11,"The sea was getting rougher and rougher. So they asked him, “What should we do to you to make the sea calm down for us?”"
Jonah,1,12,"“Pick me up and throw me into the sea,” he replied, “and it will become calm. I know that it is my fault that this great storm has come upon you.”"
Jonah,1,13,"Instead, the men did their best to row back to land. But they could not, for the sea grew even wilder than before."
Jonah,1,14,"Then they cried out to the LORD, “Please, LORD, do not let us die for taking this man’s life. Do not hold us accountable for killing an innocent man, for you, LORD, have done as you pleased.”"
Jonah,1,15,"Then they took Jonah and threw him overboard, and the raging sea grew calm."
Jonah,1,16,"At this the men greatly feared the LORD, and they offered a sacrifice to the LORD and made vows to him."
Jonah,1,17,"Now the LORD provided a huge fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights."
Jonah,2,1,From inside the fish Jonah prayed to the LORD his God.
Jonah,2,2,"He said: “In my distress I called to the LORD, and he answered me. From deep in the realm of the dead I called for help, and you listened to my cry."
Jonah,2,3,"You hurled me into the depths, into the very heart of the seas, and the currents swirled about me; all your waves and breakers swept over me."
Jonah,2,4,"I said, ‘I have been banished from your sight; yet I will look again toward your holy temple.’"
Jonah,2,5,"The engulfing waters threatened me, the deep surrounded me; seaweed was wrapped around my head."
Jonah,2,6,"To the roots of the mountains I sank down; the earth beneath barred me in forever. But you, LORD my God, brought my life up from the pit."
Jonah,2,7,"“When my life was ebbing away, I remembered you, LORD, and my prayer rose to you, to your holy temple."
Jonah,2,8,“Those who cling to worthless idols turn away from God’s love for them.
Jonah,2,9,"But I, with shouts of grateful praise, will sacrifice to you. What I have vowed I will make good. I will say, ‘Salvation comes from the LORD.’”"
Jonah,2,10,"And the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land."
Jonah,3,1,Then the word of the LORD came to Jonah a second time:
Jonah,3,2,“Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you.”
Jonah,3,3,Jonah obeyed the word of the LORD and went to Nineveh. Now Nineveh was a very large city; it took three days to go through it.
Jonah,3,4,"Jonah began by going a day’s journey into the city, proclaiming, “Forty more days and Nineveh will be overthrown.”"
Jonah,3,5,"The Ninevites believed God. A fast was proclaimed, and all of them, from the greatest to the least, put on sackcloth."
Jonah,3,6,"When Jonah’s warning reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his royal robes, covered himself with sackcloth and sat down in the dust."
Jonah,3,7,"This is the proclamation he issued in Nineveh: “By the decree of the king and his nobles: Do not let people or animals, herds or flocks, taste anything; do not let them eat or drink."
Jonah,3,8,But let people and animals be covered with sackcloth. Let everyone call urgently on God. Let them give up their evil ways and their violence.
Jonah,3,9,Who knows? God may yet relent and with compassion turn from his fierce anger so that we will not perish.”
Jonah,3,10,"When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he relented and did not bring on them the destruction he had threatened."
Jonah,4,1,"But to Jonah this seemed very wrong, and he became angry."
Jonah,4,2,"He prayed to the LORD, “Isn’t this what I said, LORD, when I was still at home? That is what I tried to forestall by fleeing to Tarshish. I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in love, a God who relents from sending calamity."
Jonah,4,3,"Now, LORD, take away my life, for it is better for me to die than to live.”"
Jonah,4,4,"But the LORD replied, “Is it right for you to be angry?”"
Jonah,4,5,"Jonah had gone out and sat down at a place east of the city. There he made himself a shelter, sat in its shade and waited to see what would happen to the city."
Jonah,4,6,"Then the LORD God provided a leafy plant and made it grow up over Jonah to give shade for his head to ease his discomfort, and Jonah was very happy about the plant."
Jonah,4,7,"But at dawn the next day God provided a worm, which chewed the plant so that it withered."
Jonah,4,8,"When the sun rose, God provided a scorching east wind, and the sun blazed on Jonah’s head so that he grew faint. He wanted to die, and said, “It would be better for me to die than to live.”"
Jonah,4,9,"But God said to Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry about the plant?” “It is,” he said. “And I’m so angry I wish I were dead.”"
Jonah,4,10,"But the LORD said, “You have been concerned about this plant, though you did not tend it or make it grow. It sprang up overnight and died overnight."
Jonah,4,11,"And should I not have concern for the great city of Nineveh, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot tell their right hand from their left—and also many animals?”"
Micah,1,1,"The word of the LORD that came to Micah of Moresheth during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah—the vision he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem."
Micah,1,2,"Hear, you peoples, all of you, listen, earth and all who live in it, that the Sovereign LORD may bear witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple."
Micah,1,3,Look! The LORD is coming from his dwelling place; he comes down and treads on the heights of the earth.
Micah,1,4,"The mountains melt beneath him and the valleys split apart, like wax before the fire, like water rushing down a slope."
Micah,1,5,"All this is because of Jacob’s transgression, because of the sins of the people of Israel. What is Jacob’s transgression? Is it not Samaria? What is Judah’s high place? Is it not Jerusalem?"
Micah,1,6,"“Therefore I will make Samaria a heap of rubble, a place for planting vineyards. I will pour her stones into the valley and lay bare her foundations."
Micah,1,7,"All her idols will be broken to pieces; all her temple gifts will be burned with fire; I will destroy all her images. Since she gathered her gifts from the wages of prostitutes, as the wages of prostitutes they will again be used.”"
Micah,1,8,Because of this I will weep and wail; I will go about barefoot and naked. I will howl like a jackal and moan like an owl.
Micah,1,9,"For Samaria’s plague is incurable; it has spread to Judah. It has reached the very gate of my people, even to Jerusalem itself."
Micah,1,10,Tell it not in Gath; weep not at all. In Beth Ophrah roll in the dust.
Micah,1,11,"Pass by naked and in shame, you who live in Shaphir. Those who live in Zaanan will not come out. Beth Ezel is in mourning; it no longer protects you."
Micah,1,12,"Those who live in Maroth writhe in pain, waiting for relief, because disaster has come from the LORD, even to the gate of Jerusalem."
Micah,1,13,"You who live in Lachish, harness fast horses to the chariot. You are where the sin of Daughter Zion began, for the transgressions of Israel were found in you."
Micah,1,14,Therefore you will give parting gifts to Moresheth Gath. The town of Akzib will prove deceptive to the kings of Israel.
Micah,1,15,I will bring a conqueror against you who live in Mareshah. The nobles of Israel will flee to Adullam.
Micah,1,16,"Shave your head in mourning for the children in whom you delight; make yourself as bald as the vulture, for they will go from you into exile."
Micah,2,1,"Woe to those who plan iniquity, to those who plot evil on their beds! At morning’s light they carry it out because it is in their power to do it."
Micah,2,2,"They covet fields and seize them, and houses, and take them. They defraud people of their homes, they rob them of their inheritance."
Micah,2,3,"Therefore, the LORD says: “I am planning disaster against this people, from which you cannot save yourselves. You will no longer walk proudly, for it will be a time of calamity."
Micah,2,4,In that day people will ridicule you; they will taunt you with this mournful song: ‘We are utterly ruined; my people’s possession is divided up. He takes it from me! He assigns our fields to traitors.’”
Micah,2,5,Therefore you will have no one in the assembly of the LORD to divide the land by lot.
Micah,2,6,"“Do not prophesy,” their prophets say. “Do not prophesy about these things; disgrace will not overtake us.”"
Micah,2,7,"You descendants of Jacob, should it be said, “Does the LORD become impatient? Does he do such things?” “Do not my words do good to the one whose ways are upright?"
Micah,2,8,"Lately my people have risen up like an enemy. You strip off the rich robe from those who pass by without a care, like men returning from battle."
Micah,2,9,You drive the women of my people from their pleasant homes. You take away my blessing from their children forever.
Micah,2,10,"Get up, go away! For this is not your resting place, because it is defiled, it is ruined, beyond all remedy."
Micah,2,11,"If a liar and deceiver comes and says, ‘I will prophesy for you plenty of wine and beer,’ that would be just the prophet for this people!"
Micah,2,12,"“I will surely gather all of you, Jacob; I will surely bring together the remnant of Israel. I will bring them together like sheep in a pen, like a flock in its pasture; the place will throng with people."
Micah,2,13,"The One who breaks open the way will go up before them; they will break through the gate and go out. Their King will pass through before them, the LORD at their head.”"
Micah,3,1,"Then I said, “Listen, you leaders of Jacob, you rulers of Israel. Should you not embrace justice,"
Micah,3,2,you who hate good and love evil; who tear the skin from my people and the flesh from their bones;
Micah,3,3,"who eat my people’s flesh, strip off their skin and break their bones in pieces; who chop them up like meat for the pan, like flesh for the pot?”"
Micah,3,4,"Then they will cry out to the LORD, but he will not answer them. At that time he will hide his face from them because of the evil they have done."
Micah,3,5,"This is what the LORD says: “As for the prophets who lead my people astray, they proclaim ‘peace’ if they have something to eat, but prepare to wage war against anyone who refuses to feed them."
Micah,3,6,"Therefore night will come over you, without visions, and darkness, without divination. The sun will set for the prophets, and the day will go dark for them."
Micah,3,7,The seers will be ashamed and the diviners disgraced. They will all cover their faces because there is no answer from God.”
Micah,3,8,"But as for me, I am filled with power, with the Spirit of the LORD, and with justice and might, to declare to Jacob his transgression, to Israel his sin."
Micah,3,9,"Hear this, you leaders of Jacob, you rulers of Israel, who despise justice and distort all that is right;"
Micah,3,10,"who build Zion with bloodshed, and Jerusalem with wickedness."
Micah,3,11,"Her leaders judge for a bribe, her priests teach for a price, and her prophets tell fortunes for money. Yet they look for the LORD’s support and say, “Is not the LORD among us? No disaster will come upon us.”"
Micah,3,12,"Therefore because of you, Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, the temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets."
Micah,4,1,"In the last days the mountain of the LORD’s temple will be established as the highest of the mountains; it will be exalted above the hills, and peoples will stream to it."
Micah,4,2,"Many nations will come and say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the temple of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths.” The law will go out from Zion, the word of the LORD from Jerusalem."
Micah,4,3,"He will judge between many peoples and will settle disputes for strong nations far and wide. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore."
Micah,4,4,"Everyone will sit under their own vine and under their own fig tree, and no one will make them afraid, for the LORD Almighty has spoken."
Micah,4,5,"All the nations may walk in the name of their gods, but we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever."
Micah,4,6,"“In that day,” declares the LORD, “I will gather the lame; I will assemble the exiles and those I have brought to grief."
Micah,4,7,"I will make the lame my remnant, those driven away a strong nation. The LORD will rule over them in Mount Zion from that day and forever."
Micah,4,8,"As for you, watchtower of the flock, stronghold of Daughter Zion, the former dominion will be restored to you; kingship will come to Daughter Jerusalem.”"
Micah,4,9,"Why do you now cry aloud— have you no king? Has your ruler perished, that pain seizes you like that of a woman in labor?"
Micah,4,10,"Writhe in agony, Daughter Zion, like a woman in labor, for now you must leave the city to camp in the open field. You will go to Babylon; there you will be rescued. There the LORD will redeem you out of the hand of your enemies."
Micah,4,11,"But now many nations are gathered against you. They say, “Let her be defiled, let our eyes gloat over Zion!”"
Micah,4,12,"But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD; they do not understand his plan, that he has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor."
Micah,4,13,"“Rise and thresh, Daughter Zion, for I will give you horns of iron; I will give you hooves of bronze, and you will break to pieces many nations.” You will devote their ill-gotten gains to the LORD, their wealth to the Lord of all the earth."
Micah,5,1,"Marshal your troops now, city of troops, for a siege is laid against us. They will strike Israel’s ruler on the cheek with a rod."
Micah,5,2,"“But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times.”"
Micah,5,3,"Therefore Israel will be abandoned until the time when she who is in labor bears a son, and the rest of his brothers return to join the Israelites."
Micah,5,4,"He will stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God. And they will live securely, for then his greatness will reach to the ends of the earth."
Micah,5,5,"And he will be our peace when the Assyrians invade our land and march through our fortresses. We will raise against them seven shepherds, even eight commanders,"
Micah,5,6,"who will rule the land of Assyria with the sword, the land of Nimrod with drawn sword. He will deliver us from the Assyrians when they invade our land and march across our borders."
Micah,5,7,"The remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples like dew from the LORD, like showers on the grass, which do not wait for anyone or depend on man."
Micah,5,8,"The remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, like a lion among the beasts of the forest, like a young lion among flocks of sheep, which mauls and mangles as it goes, and no one can rescue."
Micah,5,9,"Your hand will be lifted up in triumph over your enemies, and all your foes will be destroyed."
Micah,5,10,"“In that day,” declares the LORD, “I will destroy your horses from among you and demolish your chariots."
Micah,5,11,I will destroy the cities of your land and tear down all your strongholds.
Micah,5,12,I will destroy your witchcraft and you will no longer cast spells.
Micah,5,13,I will destroy your idols and your sacred stones from among you; you will no longer bow down to the work of your hands.
Micah,5,14,I will uproot from among you your Asherah poles when I demolish your cities.
Micah,5,15,I will take vengeance in anger and wrath on the nations that have not obeyed me.”
Micah,6,1,"Listen to what the LORD says: “Stand up, plead my case before the mountains; let the hills hear what you have to say."
Micah,6,2,"“Hear, you mountains, the LORD’s accusation; listen, you everlasting foundations of the earth. For the LORD has a case against his people; he is lodging a charge against Israel."
Micah,6,3,"“My people, what have I done to you? How have I burdened you? Answer me."
Micah,6,4,"I brought you up out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery. I sent Moses to lead you, also Aaron and Miriam."
Micah,6,5,"My people, remember what Balak king of Moab plotted and what Balaam son of Beor answered. Remember your journey from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the righteous acts of the LORD.”"
Micah,6,6,"With what shall I come before the LORD and bow down before the exalted God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old?"
Micah,6,7,"Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousand rivers of olive oil? Shall I offer my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?"
Micah,6,8,"He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God."
Micah,6,9,Listen! The LORD is calling to the city— and to fear your name is wisdom— “Heed the rod and the One who appointed it.
Micah,6,10,"Am I still to forget your ill-gotten treasures, you wicked house, and the short ephah, which is accursed?"
Micah,6,11,"Shall I acquit someone with dishonest scales, with a bag of false weights?"
Micah,6,12,Your rich people are violent; your inhabitants are liars and their tongues speak deceitfully.
Micah,6,13,"Therefore, I have begun to destroy you, to ruin you because of your sins."
Micah,6,14,"You will eat but not be satisfied; your stomach will still be empty. You will store up but save nothing, because what you save I will give to the sword."
Micah,6,15,"You will plant but not harvest; you will press olives but not use the oil, you will crush grapes but not drink the wine."
Micah,6,16,You have observed the statutes of Omri and all the practices of Ahab’s house; you have followed their traditions. Therefore I will give you over to ruin and your people to derision; you will bear the scorn of the nations.”
Micah,7,1,"What misery is mine! I am like one who gathers summer fruit at the gleaning of the vineyard; there is no cluster of grapes to eat, none of the early figs that I crave."
Micah,7,2,The faithful have been swept from the land; not one upright person remains. Everyone lies in wait to shed blood; they hunt each other with nets.
Micah,7,3,"Both hands are skilled in doing evil; the ruler demands gifts, the judge accepts bribes, the powerful dictate what they desire— they all conspire together."
Micah,7,4,"The best of them is like a brier, the most upright worse than a thorn hedge. The day God visits you has come, the day your watchmen sound the alarm. Now is the time of your confusion."
Micah,7,5,Do not trust a neighbor; put no confidence in a friend. Even with the woman who lies in your embrace guard the words of your lips.
Micah,7,6,"For a son dishonors his father, a daughter rises up against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law— a man’s enemies are the members of his own household."
Micah,7,7,"But as for me, I watch in hope for the LORD, I wait for God my Savior; my God will hear me."
Micah,7,8,"Do not gloat over me, my enemy! Though I have fallen, I will rise. Though I sit in darkness, the LORD will be my light."
Micah,7,9,"Because I have sinned against him, I will bear the LORD’s wrath, until he pleads my case and upholds my cause. He will bring me out into the light; I will see his righteousness."
Micah,7,10,"Then my enemy will see it and will be covered with shame, she who said to me, “Where is the LORD your God?” My eyes will see her downfall; even now she will be trampled underfoot like mire in the streets."
Micah,7,11,"The day for building your walls will come, the day for extending your boundaries."
Micah,7,12,"In that day people will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, even from Egypt to the Euphrates and from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain."
Micah,7,13,"The earth will become desolate because of its inhabitants, as the result of their deeds."
Micah,7,14,"Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock of your inheritance, which lives by itself in a forest, in fertile pasturelands. Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead as in days long ago."
Micah,7,15,"“As in the days when you came out of Egypt, I will show them my wonders.”"
Micah,7,16,"Nations will see and be ashamed, deprived of all their power. They will put their hands over their mouths and their ears will become deaf."
Micah,7,17,"They will lick dust like a snake, like creatures that crawl on the ground. They will come trembling out of their dens; they will turn in fear to the LORD our God and will be afraid of you."
Micah,7,18,"Who is a God like you, who pardons sin and forgives the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance? You do not stay angry forever but delight to show mercy."
Micah,7,19,You will again have compassion on us; you will tread our sins underfoot and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea.
Micah,7,20,"You will be faithful to Jacob, and show love to Abraham, as you pledged on oath to our ancestors in days long ago."
Nahum,1,1,A prophecy concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
Nahum,1,2,The LORD is a jealous and avenging God; the LORD takes vengeance and is filled with wrath. The LORD takes vengeance on his foes and vents his wrath against his enemies.
Nahum,1,3,"The LORD is slow to anger but great in power; the LORD will not leave the guilty unpunished. His way is in the whirlwind and the storm, and clouds are the dust of his feet."
Nahum,1,4,He rebukes the sea and dries it up; he makes all the rivers run dry. Bashan and Carmel wither and the blossoms of Lebanon fade.
Nahum,1,5,"The mountains quake before him and the hills melt away. The earth trembles at his presence, the world and all who live in it."
Nahum,1,6,Who can withstand his indignation? Who can endure his fierce anger? His wrath is poured out like fire; the rocks are shattered before him.
Nahum,1,7,"The LORD is good, a refuge in times of trouble. He cares for those who trust in him,"
Nahum,1,8,but with an overwhelming flood he will make an end of Nineveh; he will pursue his foes into the realm of darkness.
Nahum,1,9,Whatever they plot against the LORD he will bring to an end; trouble will not come a second time.
Nahum,1,10,They will be entangled among thorns and drunk from their wine; they will be consumed like dry stubble.
Nahum,1,11,"From you, Nineveh, has one come forth who plots evil against the LORD and devises wicked plans."
Nahum,1,12,"This is what the LORD says: “Although they have allies and are numerous, they will be destroyed and pass away. Although I have afflicted you, Judah, I will afflict you no more."
Nahum,1,13,Now I will break their yoke from your neck and tear your shackles away.”
Nahum,1,14,"The LORD has given a command concerning you, Nineveh: “You will have no descendants to bear your name. I will destroy the images and idols that are in the temple of your gods. I will prepare your grave, for you are vile.”"
Nahum,1,15,"Look, there on the mountains, the feet of one who brings good news, who proclaims peace! Celebrate your festivals, Judah, and fulfill your vows. No more will the wicked invade you; they will be completely destroyed."
Nahum,2,1,"An attacker advances against you, Nineveh. Guard the fortress, watch the road, brace yourselves, marshal all your strength!"
Nahum,2,2,"The LORD will restore the splendor of Jacob like the splendor of Israel, though destroyers have laid them waste and have ruined their vines."
Nahum,2,3,The shields of the soldiers are red; the warriors are clad in scarlet. The metal on the chariots flashes on the day they are made ready; the spears of juniper are brandished.
Nahum,2,4,"The chariots storm through the streets, rushing back and forth through the squares. They look like flaming torches; they dart about like lightning."
Nahum,2,5,"Nineveh summons her picked troops, yet they stumble on their way. They dash to the city wall; the protective shield is put in place."
Nahum,2,6,The river gates are thrown open and the palace collapses.
Nahum,2,7,It is decreed that Nineveh be exiled and carried away. Her female slaves moan like doves and beat on their breasts.
Nahum,2,8,"Nineveh is like a pool whose water is draining away. “Stop! Stop!” they cry, but no one turns back."
Nahum,2,9,"Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold! The supply is endless, the wealth from all its treasures!"
Nahum,2,10,"She is pillaged, plundered, stripped! Hearts melt, knees give way, bodies tremble, every face grows pale."
Nahum,2,11,"Where now is the lions’ den, the place where they fed their young, where the lion and lioness went, and the cubs, with nothing to fear?"
Nahum,2,12,"The lion killed enough for his cubs and strangled the prey for his mate, filling his lairs with the kill and his dens with the prey."
Nahum,2,13,"“I am against you,” declares the LORD Almighty. “I will burn up your chariots in smoke, and the sword will devour your young lions. I will leave you no prey on the earth. The voices of your messengers will no longer be heard.”"
Nahum,3,1,"Woe to the city of blood, full of lies, full of plunder, never without victims!"
Nahum,3,2,"The crack of whips, the clatter of wheels, galloping horses and jolting chariots!"
Nahum,3,3,"Charging cavalry, flashing swords and glittering spears! Many casualties, piles of dead, bodies without number, people stumbling over the corpses—"
Nahum,3,4,"all because of the wanton lust of a prostitute, alluring, the mistress of sorceries, who enslaved nations by her prostitution and peoples by her witchcraft."
Nahum,3,5,"“I am against you,” declares the LORD Almighty. “I will lift your skirts over your face. I will show the nations your nakedness and the kingdoms your shame."
Nahum,3,6,"I will pelt you with filth, I will treat you with contempt and make you a spectacle."
Nahum,3,7,"All who see you will flee from you and say, ‘Nineveh is in ruins—who will mourn for her?’ Where can I find anyone to comfort you?”"
Nahum,3,8,"Are you better than Thebes, situated on the Nile, with water around her? The river was her defense, the waters her wall."
Nahum,3,9,Cush and Egypt were her boundless strength; Put and Libya were among her allies.
Nahum,3,10,"Yet she was taken captive and went into exile. Her infants were dashed to pieces at every street corner. Lots were cast for her nobles, and all her great men were put in chains."
Nahum,3,11,You too will become drunk; you will go into hiding and seek refuge from the enemy.
Nahum,3,12,"All your fortresses are like fig trees with their first ripe fruit; when they are shaken, the figs fall into the mouth of the eater."
Nahum,3,13,Look at your troops— they are all weaklings. The gates of your land are wide open to your enemies; fire has consumed the bars of your gates.
Nahum,3,14,"Draw water for the siege, strengthen your defenses! Work the clay, tread the mortar, repair the brickwork!"
Nahum,3,15,"There the fire will consume you; the sword will cut you down— they will devour you like a swarm of locusts. Multiply like grasshoppers, multiply like locusts!"
Nahum,3,16,"You have increased the number of your merchants till they are more numerous than the stars in the sky, but like locusts they strip the land and then fly away."
Nahum,3,17,"Your guards are like locusts, your officials like swarms of locusts that settle in the walls on a cold day— but when the sun appears they fly away, and no one knows where."
Nahum,3,18,"King of Assyria, your shepherds slumber; your nobles lie down to rest. Your people are scattered on the mountains with no one to gather them."
Nahum,3,19,"Nothing can heal you; your wound is fatal. All who hear the news about you clap their hands at your fall, for who has not felt your endless cruelty?"
Habakkuk,1,1,The prophecy that Habakkuk the prophet received.
Habakkuk,1,2,"How long, LORD, must I call for help, but you do not listen? Or cry out to you, “Violence!” but you do not save?"
Habakkuk,1,3,"Why do you make me look at injustice? Why do you tolerate wrongdoing? Destruction and violence are before me; there is strife, and conflict abounds."
Habakkuk,1,4,"Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice never prevails. The wicked hem in the righteous, so that justice is perverted."
Habakkuk,1,5,"“Look at the nations and watch— and be utterly amazed. For I am going to do something in your days that you would not believe, even if you were told."
Habakkuk,1,6,"I am raising up the Babylonians, that ruthless and impetuous people, who sweep across the whole earth to seize dwellings not their own."
Habakkuk,1,7,They are a feared and dreaded people; they are a law to themselves and promote their own honor.
Habakkuk,1,8,"Their horses are swifter than leopards, fiercer than wolves at dusk. Their cavalry gallops headlong; their horsemen come from afar. They fly like an eagle swooping to devour;"
Habakkuk,1,9,they all come intent on violence. Their hordes advance like a desert wind and gather prisoners like sand.
Habakkuk,1,10,They mock kings and scoff at rulers. They laugh at all fortified cities; by building earthen ramps they capture them.
Habakkuk,1,11,"Then they sweep past like the wind and go on— guilty people, whose own strength is their god.”"
Habakkuk,1,12,"LORD, are you not from everlasting? My God, my Holy One, you will never die. You, LORD, have appointed them to execute judgment; you, my Rock, have ordained them to punish."
Habakkuk,1,13,Your eyes are too pure to look on evil; you cannot tolerate wrongdoing. Why then do you tolerate the treacherous? Why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?
Habakkuk,1,14,"You have made people like the fish in the sea, like the sea creatures that have no ruler."
Habakkuk,1,15,"The wicked foe pulls all of them up with hooks, he catches them in his net, he gathers them up in his dragnet; and so he rejoices and is glad."
Habakkuk,1,16,"Therefore he sacrifices to his net and burns incense to his dragnet, for by his net he lives in luxury and enjoys the choicest food."
Habakkuk,1,17,"Is he to keep on emptying his net, destroying nations without mercy?"
Habakkuk,2,1,"I will stand at my watch and station myself on the ramparts; I will look to see what he will say to me, and what answer I am to give to this complaint."
Habakkuk,2,2,Then the LORD replied: “Write down the revelation and make it plain on tablets so that a herald may run with it.
Habakkuk,2,3,"For the revelation awaits an appointed time; it speaks of the end and will not prove false. Though it linger, wait for it; it will certainly come and will not delay."
Habakkuk,2,4,"“See, the enemy is puffed up; his desires are not upright— but the righteous person will live by his faithfulness—"
Habakkuk,2,5,"indeed, wine betrays him; he is arrogant and never at rest. Because he is as greedy as the grave and like death is never satisfied, he gathers to himself all the nations and takes captive all the peoples."
Habakkuk,2,6,"“Will not all of them taunt him with ridicule and scorn, saying, “‘Woe to him who piles up stolen goods and makes himself wealthy by extortion! How long must this go on?’"
Habakkuk,2,7,Will not your creditors suddenly arise? Will they not wake up and make you tremble? Then you will become their prey.
Habakkuk,2,8,"Because you have plundered many nations, the peoples who are left will plunder you. For you have shed human blood; you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them."
Habakkuk,2,9,"“Woe to him who builds his house by unjust gain, setting his nest on high to escape the clutches of ruin!"
Habakkuk,2,10,"You have plotted the ruin of many peoples, shaming your own house and forfeiting your life."
Habakkuk,2,11,"The stones of the wall will cry out, and the beams of the woodwork will echo it."
Habakkuk,2,12,“Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed and establishes a town by injustice!
Habakkuk,2,13,"Has not the LORD Almighty determined that the people’s labor is only fuel for the fire, that the nations exhaust themselves for nothing?"
Habakkuk,2,14,For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD as the waters cover the sea.
Habakkuk,2,15,"“Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbors, pouring it from the wineskin till they are drunk, so that he can gaze on their naked bodies!"
Habakkuk,2,16,"You will be filled with shame instead of glory. Now it is your turn! Drink and let your nakedness be exposed! The cup from the LORD’s right hand is coming around to you, and disgrace will cover your glory."
Habakkuk,2,17,"The violence you have done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, and your destruction of animals will terrify you. For you have shed human blood; you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them."
Habakkuk,2,18,“Of what value is an idol carved by a craftsman? Or an image that teaches lies? For the one who makes it trusts in his own creation; he makes idols that cannot speak.
Habakkuk,2,19,"Woe to him who says to wood, ‘Come to life!’ Or to lifeless stone, ‘Wake up!’ Can it give guidance? It is covered with gold and silver; there is no breath in it.”"
Habakkuk,2,20,The LORD is in his holy temple; let all the earth be silent before him.
Habakkuk,3,1,A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet. On shigionoth.
Habakkuk,3,2,"LORD, I have heard of your fame; I stand in awe of your deeds, LORD. Repeat them in our day, in our time make them known; in wrath remember mercy."
Habakkuk,3,3,"God came from Teman, the Holy One from Mount Paran. His glory covered the heavens and his praise filled the earth."
Habakkuk,3,4,"His splendor was like the sunrise; rays flashed from his hand, where his power was hidden."
Habakkuk,3,5,Plague went before him; pestilence followed his steps.
Habakkuk,3,6,"He stood, and shook the earth; he looked, and made the nations tremble. The ancient mountains crumbled and the age-old hills collapsed— but he marches on forever."
Habakkuk,3,7,"I saw the tents of Cushan in distress, the dwellings of Midian in anguish."
Habakkuk,3,8,"Were you angry with the rivers, LORD? Was your wrath against the streams? Did you rage against the sea when you rode your horses and your chariots to victory?"
Habakkuk,3,9,"You uncovered your bow, you called for many arrows. You split the earth with rivers;"
Habakkuk,3,10,the mountains saw you and writhed. Torrents of water swept by; the deep roared and lifted its waves on high.
Habakkuk,3,11,"Sun and moon stood still in the heavens at the glint of your flying arrows, at the lightning of your flashing spear."
Habakkuk,3,12,In wrath you strode through the earth and in anger you threshed the nations.
Habakkuk,3,13,"You came out to deliver your people, to save your anointed one. You crushed the leader of the land of wickedness, you stripped him from head to foot."
Habakkuk,3,14,"With his own spear you pierced his head when his warriors stormed out to scatter us, gloating as though about to devour the wretched who were in hiding."
Habakkuk,3,15,"You trampled the sea with your horses, churning the great waters."
Habakkuk,3,16,"I heard and my heart pounded, my lips quivered at the sound; decay crept into my bones, and my legs trembled. Yet I will wait patiently for the day of calamity to come on the nation invading us."
Habakkuk,3,17,"Though the fig tree does not bud and there are no grapes on the vines, though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food, though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls,"
Habakkuk,3,18,"yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will be joyful in God my Savior."
Habakkuk,3,19,"The Sovereign LORD is my strength; he makes my feet like the feet of a deer, he enables me to tread on the heights. For the director of music. On my stringed instruments."
Zephaniah,1,1,"The word of the LORD that came to Zephaniah son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, during the reign of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah:"
Zephaniah,1,2,"“I will sweep away everything from the face of the earth,” declares the LORD."
Zephaniah,1,3,"“I will sweep away both man and beast; I will sweep away the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea— and the idols that cause the wicked to stumble.” “When I destroy all mankind on the face of the earth,” declares the LORD,"
Zephaniah,1,4,"“I will stretch out my hand against Judah and against all who live in Jerusalem. I will destroy every remnant of Baal worship in this place, the very names of the idolatrous priests—"
Zephaniah,1,5,"those who bow down on the roofs to worship the starry host, those who bow down and swear by the LORD and who also swear by Molek,"
Zephaniah,1,6,those who turn back from following the LORD and neither seek the LORD nor inquire of him.”
Zephaniah,1,7,"Be silent before the Sovereign LORD, for the day of the LORD is near. The LORD has prepared a sacrifice; he has consecrated those he has invited."
Zephaniah,1,8,“On the day of the LORD’s sacrifice I will punish the officials and the king’s sons and all those clad in foreign clothes.
Zephaniah,1,9,"On that day I will punish all who avoid stepping on the threshold, who fill the temple of their gods with violence and deceit."
Zephaniah,1,10,"“On that day,” declares the LORD, “a cry will go up from the Fish Gate, wailing from the New Quarter, and a loud crash from the hills."
Zephaniah,1,11,"Wail, you who live in the market district; all your merchants will be wiped out, all who trade with silver will be destroyed."
Zephaniah,1,12,"At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps and punish those who are complacent, who are like wine left on its dregs, who think, ‘The LORD will do nothing, either good or bad.’"
Zephaniah,1,13,"Their wealth will be plundered, their houses demolished. Though they build houses, they will not live in them; though they plant vineyards, they will not drink the wine.”"
Zephaniah,1,14,The great day of the LORD is near— near and coming quickly. The cry on the day of the LORD is bitter; the Mighty Warrior shouts his battle cry.
Zephaniah,1,15,"That day will be a day of wrath— a day of distress and anguish, a day of trouble and ruin, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness—"
Zephaniah,1,16,a day of trumpet and battle cry against the fortified cities and against the corner towers.
Zephaniah,1,17,"“I will bring such distress on all people that they will grope about like those who are blind, because they have sinned against the LORD. Their blood will be poured out like dust and their entrails like dung."
Zephaniah,1,18,"Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them on the day of the LORD’s wrath.” In the fire of his jealousy the whole earth will be consumed, for he will make a sudden end of all who live on the earth."
Zephaniah,2,1,"Judah Summoned to Repent Gather together, gather yourselves together, you shameful nation,"
Zephaniah,2,2,"before the decree takes effect and that day passes like windblown chaff, before the LORD’s fierce anger comes upon you, before the day of the LORD’s wrath comes upon you."
Zephaniah,2,3,"Seek the LORD, all you humble of the land, you who do what he commands. Seek righteousness, seek humility; perhaps you will be sheltered on the day of the LORD’s anger."
Zephaniah,2,4,Philistia Gaza will be abandoned and Ashkelon left in ruins. At midday Ashdod will be emptied and Ekron uprooted.
Zephaniah,2,5,"Woe to you who live by the sea, you Kerethite people; the word of the LORD is against you, Canaan, land of the Philistines. He says, “I will destroy you, and none will be left.”"
Zephaniah,2,6,The land by the sea will become pastures having wells for shepherds and pens for flocks.
Zephaniah,2,7,That land will belong to the remnant of the people of Judah; there they will find pasture. In the evening they will lie down in the houses of Ashkelon. The LORD their God will care for them; he will restore their fortunes.
Zephaniah,2,8,"Moab and Ammon “I have heard the insults of Moab and the taunts of the Ammonites, who insulted my people and made threats against their land."
Zephaniah,2,9,"Therefore, as surely as I live,” declares the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, “surely Moab will become like Sodom, the Ammonites like Gomorrah— a place of weeds and salt pits, a wasteland forever. The remnant of my people will plunder them; the survivors of my nation will inherit their land.”"
Zephaniah,2,10,"This is what they will get in return for their pride, for insulting and mocking the people of the LORD Almighty."
Zephaniah,2,11,"The LORD will be awesome to them when he destroys all the gods of the earth. Distant nations will bow down to him, all of them in their own lands."
Zephaniah,2,12,"Cush “You Cushites, too, will be slain by my sword.”"
Zephaniah,2,13,"Assyria He will stretch out his hand against the north and destroy Assyria, leaving Nineveh utterly desolate and dry as the desert."
Zephaniah,2,14,"Flocks and herds will lie down there, creatures of every kind. The desert owl and the screech owl will roost on her columns. Their hooting will echo through the windows, rubble will fill the doorways, the beams of cedar will be exposed."
Zephaniah,2,15,"This is the city of revelry that lived in safety. She said to herself, “I am the one! And there is none besides me.” What a ruin she has become, a lair for wild beasts! All who pass by her scoff and shake their fists."
Zephaniah,3,1,"Jerusalem Woe to the city of oppressors, rebellious and defiled!"
Zephaniah,3,2,"She obeys no one, she accepts no correction. She does not trust in the LORD, she does not draw near to her God."
Zephaniah,3,3,"Her officials within her are roaring lions; her rulers are evening wolves, who leave nothing for the morning."
Zephaniah,3,4,Her prophets are unprincipled; they are treacherous people. Her priests profane the sanctuary and do violence to the law.
Zephaniah,3,5,"The LORD within her is righteous; he does no wrong. Morning by morning he dispenses his justice, and every new day he does not fail, yet the unrighteous know no shame."
Zephaniah,3,6,"Jerusalem Remains Unrepentant “I have destroyed nations; their strongholds are demolished. I have left their streets deserted, with no one passing through. Their cities are laid waste; they are deserted and empty."
Zephaniah,3,7,"Of Jerusalem I thought, ‘Surely you will fear me and accept correction!’ Then her place of refuge would not be destroyed, nor all my punishments come upon her. But they were still eager to act corruptly in all they did."
Zephaniah,3,8,"Therefore wait for me,” declares the LORD, “for the day I will stand up to testify. I have decided to assemble the nations, to gather the kingdoms and to pour out my wrath on them— all my fierce anger. The whole world will be consumed by the fire of my jealous anger."
Zephaniah,3,9,"“Then I will purify the lips of the peoples, that all of them may call on the name of the LORD and serve him shoulder to shoulder."
Zephaniah,3,10,"From beyond the rivers of Cush my worshipers, my scattered people, will bring me offerings."
Zephaniah,3,11,"On that day you, Jerusalem, will not be put to shame for all the wrongs you have done to me, because I will remove from you your arrogant boasters. Never again will you be haughty on my holy hill."
Zephaniah,3,12,But I will leave within you the meek and humble. The remnant of Israel will trust in the name of the LORD.
Zephaniah,3,13,They will do no wrong; they will tell no lies. A deceitful tongue will not be found in their mouths. They will eat and lie down and no one will make them afraid.”
Zephaniah,3,14,"Sing, Daughter Zion; shout aloud, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, Daughter Jerusalem!"
Zephaniah,3,15,"The LORD has taken away your punishment, he has turned back your enemy. The LORD, the King of Israel, is with you; never again will you fear any harm."
Zephaniah,3,16,"On that day they will say to Jerusalem, “Do not fear, Zion; do not let your hands hang limp."
Zephaniah,3,17,"The LORD your God is with you, the Mighty Warrior who saves. He will take great delight in you; in his love he will no longer rebuke you, but will rejoice over you with singing.”"
Zephaniah,3,18,"“I will remove from you all who mourn over the loss of your appointed festivals, which is a burden and reproach for you."
Zephaniah,3,19,At that time I will deal with all who oppressed you. I will rescue the lame; I will gather the exiles. I will give them praise and honor in every land where they have suffered shame.
Zephaniah,3,20,"At that time I will gather you; at that time I will bring you home. I will give you honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth when I restore your fortunes before your very eyes,” says the LORD."
Haggai,1,1,"In the second year of King Darius, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of the LORD came through the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest:"
Haggai,1,2,"This is what the LORD Almighty says: “These people say, ‘The time has not yet come to rebuild the LORD’s house.’”"
Haggai,1,3,Then the word of the LORD came through the prophet Haggai:
Haggai,1,4,"“Is it a time for you yourselves to be living in your paneled houses, while this house remains a ruin?”"
Haggai,1,5,Now this is what the LORD Almighty says: “Give careful thought to your ways.
Haggai,1,6,"You have planted much, but harvested little. You eat, but never have enough. You drink, but never have your fill. You put on clothes, but are not warm. You earn wages, only to put them in a purse with holes in it.”"
Haggai,1,7,This is what the LORD Almighty says: “Give careful thought to your ways.
Haggai,1,8,"Go up into the mountains and bring down timber and build my house, so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored,” says the LORD."
Haggai,1,9,"“You expected much, but see, it turned out to be little. What you brought home, I blew away. Why?” declares the LORD Almighty. “Because of my house, which remains a ruin, while each of you is busy with your own house."
Haggai,1,10,"Therefore, because of you the heavens have withheld their dew and the earth its crops."
Haggai,1,11,"I called for a drought on the fields and the mountains, on the grain, the new wine, the olive oil and everything else the ground produces, on people and livestock, and on all the labor of your hands.”"
Haggai,1,12,"Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest, and the whole remnant of the people obeyed the voice of the LORD their God and the message of the prophet Haggai, because the LORD their God had sent him. And the people feared the LORD."
Haggai,1,13,"Then Haggai, the LORD’s messenger, gave this message of the LORD to the people: “I am with you,” declares the LORD."
Haggai,1,14,"So the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of the whole remnant of the people. They came and began to work on the house of the LORD Almighty, their God,"
Haggai,1,15,"In the second year of King Darius,"
Haggai,2,1,"on the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of the LORD came through the prophet Haggai:"
Haggai,2,2,"“Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, to Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people. Ask them,"
Haggai,2,3,‘Who of you is left who saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Does it not seem to you like nothing?
Haggai,2,4,"But now be strong, Zerubbabel,’ declares the LORD. ‘Be strong, Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,’ declares the LORD, ‘and work. For I am with you,’ declares the LORD Almighty."
Haggai,2,5,‘This is what I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt. And my Spirit remains among you. Do not fear.’
Haggai,2,6,"“This is what the LORD Almighty says: ‘In a little while I will once more shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land."
Haggai,2,7,"I will shake all nations, and what is desired by all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory,’ says the LORD Almighty."
Haggai,2,8,"‘The silver is mine and the gold is mine,’ declares the LORD Almighty."
Haggai,2,9,"‘The glory of this present house will be greater than the glory of the former house,’ says the LORD Almighty. ‘And in this place I will grant peace,’ declares the LORD Almighty.”"
Haggai,2,10,"On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Haggai:"
Haggai,2,11,“This is what the LORD Almighty says: ‘Ask the priests what the law says:
Haggai,2,12,"If someone carries consecrated meat in the fold of their garment, and that fold touches some bread or stew, some wine, olive oil or other food, does it become consecrated?’” The priests answered, “No.”"
Haggai,2,13,"Then Haggai said, “If a person defiled by contact with a dead body touches one of these things, does it become defiled?” “Yes,” the priests replied, “it becomes defiled.”"
Haggai,2,14,"Then Haggai said, “‘So it is with this people and this nation in my sight,’ declares the LORD. ‘Whatever they do and whatever they offer there is defiled."
Haggai,2,15,“‘Now give careful thought to this from this day on—consider how things were before one stone was laid on another in the LORD’s temple.
Haggai,2,16,"When anyone came to a heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When anyone went to a wine vat to draw fifty measures, there were only twenty."
Haggai,2,17,"I struck all the work of your hands with blight, mildew and hail, yet you did not return to me,’ declares the LORD."
Haggai,2,18,"‘From this day on, from this twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, give careful thought to the day when the foundation of the LORD’s temple was laid. Give careful thought:"
Haggai,2,19,"Is there yet any seed left in the barn? Until now, the vine and the fig tree, the pomegranate and the olive tree have not borne fruit. “‘From this day on I will bless you.’”"
Haggai,2,20,The word of the LORD came to Haggai a second time on the twenty-fourth day of the month:
Haggai,2,21,“Tell Zerubbabel governor of Judah that I am going to shake the heavens and the earth.
Haggai,2,22,"I will overturn royal thrones and shatter the power of the foreign kingdoms. I will overthrow chariots and their drivers; horses and their riders will fall, each by the sword of his brother."
Haggai,2,23,"“‘On that day,’ declares the LORD Almighty, ‘I will take you, my servant Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel,’ declares the LORD, ‘and I will make you like my signet ring, for I have chosen you,’ declares the LORD Almighty.”"
Zechariah,1,1,"In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, the son of Iddo:"
Zechariah,1,2,“The LORD was very angry with your ancestors.
Zechariah,1,3,"Therefore tell the people: This is what the LORD Almighty says: ‘Return to me,’ declares the LORD Almighty, ‘and I will return to you,’ says the LORD Almighty."
Zechariah,1,4,"Do not be like your ancestors, to whom the earlier prophets proclaimed: This is what the LORD Almighty says: ‘Turn from your evil ways and your evil practices.’ But they would not listen or pay attention to me, declares the LORD."
Zechariah,1,5,"Where are your ancestors now? And the prophets, do they live forever?"
Zechariah,1,6,"But did not my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants the prophets, overtake your ancestors? “Then they repented and said, ‘The LORD Almighty has done to us what our ways and practices deserve, just as he determined to do.’”"
Zechariah,1,7,"On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, the son of Iddo."
Zechariah,1,8,"During the night I had a vision, and there before me was a man mounted on a red horse. He was standing among the myrtle trees in a ravine. Behind him were red, brown and white horses."
Zechariah,1,9,"I asked, “What are these, my lord?” The angel who was talking with me answered, “I will show you what they are.”"
Zechariah,1,10,"Then the man standing among the myrtle trees explained, “They are the ones the LORD has sent to go throughout the earth.”"
Zechariah,1,11,"And they reported to the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees, “We have gone throughout the earth and found the whole world at rest and in peace.”"
Zechariah,1,12,"Then the angel of the LORD said, “LORD Almighty, how long will you withhold mercy from Jerusalem and from the towns of Judah, which you have been angry with these seventy years?”"
Zechariah,1,13,So the LORD spoke kind and comforting words to the angel who talked with me.
Zechariah,1,14,"Then the angel who was speaking to me said, “Proclaim this word: This is what the LORD Almighty says: ‘I am very jealous for Jerusalem and Zion,"
Zechariah,1,15,"and I am very angry with the nations that feel secure. I was only a little angry, but they went too far with the punishment.’"
Zechariah,1,16,"“Therefore this is what the LORD says: ‘I will return to Jerusalem with mercy, and there my house will be rebuilt. And the measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem,’ declares the LORD Almighty."
Zechariah,1,17,"“Proclaim further: This is what the LORD Almighty says: ‘My towns will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem.’”"
Zechariah,1,18,"Then I looked up, and there before me were four horns."
Zechariah,1,19,"I asked the angel who was speaking to me, “What are these?” He answered me, “These are the horns that scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.”"
Zechariah,1,20,Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen.
Zechariah,1,21,"I asked, “What are these coming to do?” He answered, “These are the horns that scattered Judah so that no one could raise their head, but the craftsmen have come to terrify them and throw down these horns of the nations who lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter its people.”"
Zechariah,2,1,"Then I looked up, and there before me was a man with a measuring line in his hand."
Zechariah,2,2,"I asked, “Where are you going?” He answered me, “To measure Jerusalem, to find out how wide and how long it is.”"
Zechariah,2,3,"While the angel who was speaking to me was leaving, another angel came to meet him"
Zechariah,2,4,"and said to him: “Run, tell that young man, ‘Jerusalem will be a city without walls because of the great number of people and animals in it."
Zechariah,2,5,"And I myself will be a wall of fire around it,’ declares the LORD, ‘and I will be its glory within.’"
Zechariah,2,6,"“Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north,” declares the LORD, “for I have scattered you to the four winds of heaven,” declares the LORD."
Zechariah,2,7,"“Come, Zion! Escape, you who live in Daughter Babylon!”"
Zechariah,2,8,For this is what the LORD Almighty says: “After the Glorious One has sent me against the nations that have plundered you—for whoever touches you touches the apple of his eye—
Zechariah,2,9,I will surely raise my hand against them so that their slaves will plunder them. Then you will know that the LORD Almighty has sent me.
Zechariah,2,10,"“Shout and be glad, Daughter Zion. For I am coming, and I will live among you,” declares the LORD."
Zechariah,2,11,“Many nations will be joined with the LORD in that day and will become my people. I will live among you and you will know that the LORD Almighty has sent me to you.
Zechariah,2,12,The LORD will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land and will again choose Jerusalem.
Zechariah,2,13,"Be still before the LORD, all mankind, because he has roused himself from his holy dwelling.”"
Zechariah,3,1,"Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right side to accuse him."
Zechariah,3,2,"The LORD said to Satan, “The LORD rebuke you, Satan! The LORD, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not this man a burning stick snatched from the fire?”"
Zechariah,3,3,Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel.
Zechariah,3,4,"The angel said to those who were standing before him, “Take off his filthy clothes.” Then he said to Joshua, “See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put fine garments on you.”"
Zechariah,3,5,"Then I said, “Put a clean turban on his head.” So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him, while the angel of the LORD stood by."
Zechariah,3,6,The angel of the LORD gave this charge to Joshua:
Zechariah,3,7,"“This is what the LORD Almighty says: ‘If you will walk in obedience to me and keep my requirements, then you will govern my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you a place among these standing here."
Zechariah,3,8,"“‘Listen, High Priest Joshua, you and your associates seated before you, who are men symbolic of things to come: I am going to bring my servant, the Branch."
Zechariah,3,9,"See, the stone I have set in front of Joshua! There are seven eyes on that one stone, and I will engrave an inscription on it,’ says the LORD Almighty, ‘and I will remove the sin of this land in a single day."
Zechariah,3,10,"“‘In that day each of you will invite your neighbor to sit under your vine and fig tree,’ declares the LORD Almighty.”"
Zechariah,4,1,"Then the angel who talked with me returned and woke me up, like someone awakened from sleep."
Zechariah,4,2,"He asked me, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl at the top and seven lamps on it, with seven channels to the lamps."
Zechariah,4,3,"Also there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.”"
Zechariah,4,4,"I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”"
Zechariah,4,5,"He answered, “Do you not know what these are?” “No, my lord,” I replied."
Zechariah,4,6,"So he said to me, “This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel: ‘Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,’ says the LORD Almighty."
Zechariah,4,7,"“What are you, mighty mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become level ground. Then he will bring out the capstone to shouts of ‘God bless it! God bless it!’”"
Zechariah,4,8,Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Zechariah,4,9,“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this temple; his hands will also complete it. Then you will know that the LORD Almighty has sent me to you.
Zechariah,4,10,"“Who dares despise the day of small things, since the seven eyes of the LORD that range throughout the earth will rejoice when they see the chosen capstone in the hand of Zerubbabel?”"
Zechariah,4,11,"Then I asked the angel, “What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?”"
Zechariah,4,12,"Again I asked him, “What are these two olive branches beside the two gold pipes that pour out golden oil?”"
Zechariah,4,13,"He replied, “Do you not know what these are?” “No, my lord,” I said."
Zechariah,4,14,"So he said, “These are the two who are anointed to serve the Lord of all the earth.”"
Zechariah,5,1,"I looked again, and there before me was a flying scroll."
Zechariah,5,2,"He asked me, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a flying scroll, twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide.”"
Zechariah,5,3,"And he said to me, “This is the curse that is going out over the whole land; for according to what it says on one side, every thief will be banished, and according to what it says on the other, everyone who swears falsely will be banished."
Zechariah,5,4,"The LORD Almighty declares, ‘I will send it out, and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of anyone who swears falsely by my name. It will remain in that house and destroy it completely, both its timbers and its stones.’”"
Zechariah,5,5,"Then the angel who was speaking to me came forward and said to me, “Look up and see what is appearing.”"
Zechariah,5,6,"I asked, “What is it?” He replied, “It is a basket.” And he added, “This is the iniquity of the people throughout the land.”"
Zechariah,5,7,"Then the cover of lead was raised, and there in the basket sat a woman!"
Zechariah,5,8,"He said, “This is wickedness,” and he pushed her back into the basket and pushed its lead cover down on it."
Zechariah,5,9,"Then I looked up—and there before me were two women, with the wind in their wings! They had wings like those of a stork, and they lifted up the basket between heaven and earth."
Zechariah,5,10,“Where are they taking the basket?” I asked the angel who was speaking to me.
Zechariah,5,11,"He replied, “To the country of Babylonia to build a house for it. When the house is ready, the basket will be set there in its place.”"
Zechariah,6,1,"I looked up again, and there before me were four chariots coming out from between two mountains—mountains of bronze."
Zechariah,6,2,"The first chariot had red horses, the second black,"
Zechariah,6,3,"the third white, and the fourth dappled—all of them powerful."
Zechariah,6,4,"I asked the angel who was speaking to me, “What are these, my lord?”"
Zechariah,6,5,"The angel answered me, “These are the four spirits of heaven, going out from standing in the presence of the Lord of the whole world."
Zechariah,6,6,"The one with the black horses is going toward the north country, the one with the white horses toward the west, and the one with the dappled horses toward the south.”"
Zechariah,6,7,"When the powerful horses went out, they were straining to go throughout the earth. And he said, “Go throughout the earth!” So they went throughout the earth."
Zechariah,6,8,"Then he called to me, “Look, those going toward the north country have given my Spirit rest in the land of the north.”"
Zechariah,6,9,The word of the LORD came to me:
Zechariah,6,10,"“Take silver and gold from the exiles Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon. Go the same day to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah."
Zechariah,6,11,"Take the silver and gold and make a crown, and set it on the head of the high priest, Joshua son of Jozadak."
Zechariah,6,12,"Tell him this is what the LORD Almighty says: ‘Here is the man whose name is the Branch, and he will branch out from his place and build the temple of the LORD."
Zechariah,6,13,"It is he who will build the temple of the LORD, and he will be clothed with majesty and will sit and rule on his throne. And he will be a priest on his throne. And there will be harmony between the two.’"
Zechariah,6,14,"The crown will be given to Heldai, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen son of Zephaniah as a memorial in the temple of the LORD."
Zechariah,6,15,"Those who are far away will come and help to build the temple of the LORD, and you will know that the LORD Almighty has sent me to you. This will happen if you diligently obey the LORD your God.”"
Zechariah,7,1,"In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, the month of Kislev."
Zechariah,7,2,"The people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-Melek, together with their men, to entreat the LORD"
Zechariah,7,3,"by asking the priests of the house of the LORD Almighty and the prophets, “Should I mourn and fast in the fifth month, as I have done for so many years?”"
Zechariah,7,4,Then the word of the LORD Almighty came to me:
Zechariah,7,5,"“Ask all the people of the land and the priests, ‘When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months for the past seventy years, was it really for me that you fasted?"
Zechariah,7,6,"And when you were eating and drinking, were you not just feasting for yourselves?"
Zechariah,7,7,"Are these not the words the LORD proclaimed through the earlier prophets when Jerusalem and its surrounding towns were at rest and prosperous, and the Negev and the western foothills were settled?’”"
Zechariah,7,8,And the word of the LORD came again to Zechariah:
Zechariah,7,9,“This is what the LORD Almighty said: ‘Administer true justice; show mercy and compassion to one another.
Zechariah,7,10,"Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the foreigner or the poor. Do not plot evil against each other.’"
Zechariah,7,11,“But they refused to pay attention; stubbornly they turned their backs and covered their ears.
Zechariah,7,12,They made their hearts as hard as flint and would not listen to the law or to the words that the LORD Almighty had sent by his Spirit through the earlier prophets. So the LORD Almighty was very angry.
Zechariah,7,13,"“‘When I called, they did not listen; so when they called, I would not listen,’ says the LORD Almighty."
Zechariah,7,14,"‘I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations, where they were strangers. The land they left behind them was so desolate that no one traveled through it. This is how they made the pleasant land desolate.’”"
Zechariah,8,1,The word of the LORD Almighty came to me.
Zechariah,8,2,This is what the LORD Almighty says: “I am very jealous for Zion; I am burning with jealousy for her.”
Zechariah,8,3,"This is what the LORD says: “I will return to Zion and dwell in Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the Faithful City, and the mountain of the LORD Almighty will be called the Holy Mountain.”"
Zechariah,8,4,"This is what the LORD Almighty says: “Once again men and women of ripe old age will sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each of them with cane in hand because of their age."
Zechariah,8,5,The city streets will be filled with boys and girls playing there.”
Zechariah,8,6,"This is what the LORD Almighty says: “It may seem marvelous to the remnant of this people at that time, but will it seem marvelous to me?” declares the LORD Almighty."
Zechariah,8,7,This is what the LORD Almighty says: “I will save my people from the countries of the east and the west.
Zechariah,8,8,"I will bring them back to live in Jerusalem; they will be my people, and I will be faithful and righteous to them as their God.”"
Zechariah,8,9,"This is what the LORD Almighty says: “Now hear these words, ‘Let your hands be strong so that the temple may be built.’ This is also what the prophets said who were present when the foundation was laid for the house of the LORD Almighty."
Zechariah,8,10,"Before that time there were no wages for people or hire for animals. No one could go about their business safely because of their enemies, since I had turned everyone against their neighbor."
Zechariah,8,11,"But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as I did in the past,” declares the LORD Almighty."
Zechariah,8,12,"“The seed will grow well, the vine will yield its fruit, the ground will produce its crops, and the heavens will drop their dew. I will give all these things as an inheritance to the remnant of this people."
Zechariah,8,13,"Just as you, Judah and Israel, have been a curse among the nations, so I will save you, and you will be a blessing. Do not be afraid, but let your hands be strong.”"
Zechariah,8,14,"This is what the LORD Almighty says: “Just as I had determined to bring disaster on you and showed no pity when your ancestors angered me,” says the LORD Almighty,"
Zechariah,8,15,“so now I have determined to do good again to Jerusalem and Judah. Do not be afraid.
Zechariah,8,16,"These are the things you are to do: Speak the truth to each other, and render true and sound judgment in your courts;"
Zechariah,8,17,"do not plot evil against each other, and do not love to swear falsely. I hate all this,” declares the LORD."
Zechariah,8,18,The word of the LORD Almighty came to me.
Zechariah,8,19,"This is what the LORD Almighty says: “The fasts of the fourth, fifth, seventh and tenth months will become joyful and glad occasions and happy festivals for Judah. Therefore love truth and peace.”"
Zechariah,8,20,"This is what the LORD Almighty says: “Many peoples and the inhabitants of many cities will yet come,"
Zechariah,8,21,"and the inhabitants of one city will go to another and say, ‘Let us go at once to entreat the LORD and seek the LORD Almighty. I myself am going.’"
Zechariah,8,22,And many peoples and powerful nations will come to Jerusalem to seek the LORD Almighty and to entreat him.”
Zechariah,8,23,"This is what the LORD Almighty says: “In those days ten people from all languages and nations will take firm hold of one Jew by the hem of his robe and say, ‘Let us go with you, because we have heard that God is with you.’”"
Zechariah,9,1,A prophecy: The word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrak and will come to rest on Damascus— for the eyes of all people and all the tribes of Israel are on the LORD—
Zechariah,9,2,"and on Hamath too, which borders on it, and on Tyre and Sidon, though they are very skillful."
Zechariah,9,3,"Tyre has built herself a stronghold; she has heaped up silver like dust, and gold like the dirt of the streets."
Zechariah,9,4,"But the Lord will take away her possessions and destroy her power on the sea, and she will be consumed by fire."
Zechariah,9,5,"Ashkelon will see it and fear; Gaza will writhe in agony, and Ekron too, for her hope will wither. Gaza will lose her king and Ashkelon will be deserted."
Zechariah,9,6,"A mongrel people will occupy Ashdod, and I will put an end to the pride of the Philistines."
Zechariah,9,7,"I will take the blood from their mouths, the forbidden food from between their teeth. Those who are left will belong to our God and become a clan in Judah, and Ekron will be like the Jebusites."
Zechariah,9,8,"But I will encamp at my temple to guard it against marauding forces. Never again will an oppressor overrun my people, for now I am keeping watch."
Zechariah,9,9,"Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion! Shout, Daughter Jerusalem! See, your king comes to you, righteous and victorious, lowly and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
Zechariah,9,10,"I will take away the chariots from Ephraim and the warhorses from Jerusalem, and the battle bow will be broken. He will proclaim peace to the nations. His rule will extend from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth."
Zechariah,9,11,"As for you, because of the blood of my covenant with you, I will free your prisoners from the waterless pit."
Zechariah,9,12,"Return to your fortress, you prisoners of hope; even now I announce that I will restore twice as much to you."
Zechariah,9,13,"I will bend Judah as I bend my bow and fill it with Ephraim. I will rouse your sons, Zion, against your sons, Greece, and make you like a warrior’s sword."
Zechariah,9,14,"Then the LORD will appear over them; his arrow will flash like lightning. The Sovereign LORD will sound the trumpet; he will march in the storms of the south,"
Zechariah,9,15,and the LORD Almighty will shield them. They will destroy and overcome with slingstones. They will drink and roar as with wine; they will be full like a bowl used for sprinkling the corners of the altar.
Zechariah,9,16,The LORD their God will save his people on that day as a shepherd saves his flock. They will sparkle in his land like jewels in a crown.
Zechariah,9,17,"How attractive and beautiful they will be! Grain will make the young men thrive, and new wine the young women."
Zechariah,10,1,"Ask the LORD for rain in the springtime; it is the LORD who sends the thunderstorms. He gives showers of rain to all people, and plants of the field to everyone."
Zechariah,10,2,"The idols speak deceitfully, diviners see visions that lie; they tell dreams that are false, they give comfort in vain. Therefore the people wander like sheep oppressed for lack of a shepherd."
Zechariah,10,3,"“My anger burns against the shepherds, and I will punish the leaders; for the LORD Almighty will care for his flock, the people of Judah, and make them like a proud horse in battle."
Zechariah,10,4,"From Judah will come the cornerstone, from him the tent peg, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler."
Zechariah,10,5,"Together they will be like warriors in battle trampling their enemy into the mud of the streets. They will fight because the LORD is with them, and they will put the enemy horsemen to shame."
Zechariah,10,6,"“I will strengthen Judah and save the tribes of Joseph. I will restore them because I have compassion on them. They will be as though I had not rejected them, for I am the LORD their God and I will answer them."
Zechariah,10,7,"The Ephraimites will become like warriors, and their hearts will be glad as with wine. Their children will see it and be joyful; their hearts will rejoice in the LORD."
Zechariah,10,8,I will signal for them and gather them in. Surely I will redeem them; they will be as numerous as before.
Zechariah,10,9,"Though I scatter them among the peoples, yet in distant lands they will remember me. They and their children will survive, and they will return."
Zechariah,10,10,"I will bring them back from Egypt and gather them from Assyria. I will bring them to Gilead and Lebanon, and there will not be room enough for them."
Zechariah,10,11,They will pass through the sea of trouble; the surging sea will be subdued and all the depths of the Nile will dry up. Assyria’s pride will be brought down and Egypt’s scepter will pass away.
Zechariah,10,12,"I will strengthen them in the LORD and in his name they will live securely,” declares the LORD."
Zechariah,11,1,"Open your doors, Lebanon, so that fire may devour your cedars!"
Zechariah,11,2,"Wail, you juniper, for the cedar has fallen; the stately trees are ruined! Wail, oaks of Bashan; the dense forest has been cut down!"
Zechariah,11,3,Listen to the wail of the shepherds; their rich pastures are destroyed! Listen to the roar of the lions; the lush thicket of the Jordan is ruined!
Zechariah,11,4,This is what the LORD my God says: “Shepherd the flock marked for slaughter.
Zechariah,11,5,"Their buyers slaughter them and go unpunished. Those who sell them say, ‘Praise the LORD, I am rich!’ Their own shepherds do not spare them."
Zechariah,11,6,"For I will no longer have pity on the people of the land,” declares the LORD. “I will give everyone into the hands of their neighbors and their king. They will devastate the land, and I will not rescue anyone from their hands.”"
Zechariah,11,7,"So I shepherded the flock marked for slaughter, particularly the oppressed of the flock. Then I took two staffs and called one Favor and the other Union, and I shepherded the flock."
Zechariah,11,8,"In one month I got rid of the three shepherds. The flock detested me, and I grew weary of them"
Zechariah,11,9,"and said, “I will not be your shepherd. Let the dying die, and the perishing perish. Let those who are left eat one another’s flesh.”"
Zechariah,11,10,"Then I took my staff called Favor and broke it, revoking the covenant I had made with all the nations."
Zechariah,11,11,"It was revoked on that day, and so the oppressed of the flock who were watching me knew it was the word of the LORD."
Zechariah,11,12,"I told them, “If you think it best, give me my pay; but if not, keep it.” So they paid me thirty pieces of silver."
Zechariah,11,13,"And the LORD said to me, “Throw it to the potter”—the handsome price at which they valued me! So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter at the house of the LORD."
Zechariah,11,14,"Then I broke my second staff called Union, breaking the family bond between Judah and Israel."
Zechariah,11,15,"Then the LORD said to me, “Take again the equipment of a foolish shepherd."
Zechariah,11,16,"For I am going to raise up a shepherd over the land who will not care for the lost, or seek the young, or heal the injured, or feed the healthy, but will eat the meat of the choice sheep, tearing off their hooves."
Zechariah,11,17,"“Woe to the worthless shepherd, who deserts the flock! May the sword strike his arm and his right eye! May his arm be completely withered, his right eye totally blinded!”"
Zechariah,12,1,"A prophecy: The word of the LORD concerning Israel. The LORD, who stretches out the heavens, who lays the foundation of the earth, and who forms the human spirit within a person, declares:"
Zechariah,12,2,“I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that sends all the surrounding peoples reeling. Judah will be besieged as well as Jerusalem.
Zechariah,12,3,"On that day, when all the nations of the earth are gathered against her, I will make Jerusalem an immovable rock for all the nations. All who try to move it will injure themselves."
Zechariah,12,4,"On that day I will strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness,” declares the LORD. “I will keep a watchful eye over Judah, but I will blind all the horses of the nations."
Zechariah,12,5,"Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, ‘The people of Jerusalem are strong, because the LORD Almighty is their God.’"
Zechariah,12,6,"“On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot in a woodpile, like a flaming torch among sheaves. They will consume all the surrounding peoples right and left, but Jerusalem will remain intact in her place."
Zechariah,12,7,"“The LORD will save the dwellings of Judah first, so that the honor of the house of David and of Jerusalem’s inhabitants may not be greater than that of Judah."
Zechariah,12,8,"On that day the LORD will shield those who live in Jerusalem, so that the feeblest among them will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD going before them."
Zechariah,12,9,On that day I will set out to destroy all the nations that attack Jerusalem.
Zechariah,12,10,"“And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and supplication. They will look on me, the one they have pierced, and they will mourn for him as one mourns for an only child, and grieve bitterly for him as one grieves for a firstborn son."
Zechariah,12,11,On that day the weeping in Jerusalem will be as great as the weeping of Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
Zechariah,12,12,"The land will mourn, each clan by itself, with their wives by themselves: the clan of the house of David and their wives, the clan of the house of Nathan and their wives,"
Zechariah,12,13,"the clan of the house of Levi and their wives, the clan of Shimei and their wives,"
Zechariah,12,14,and all the rest of the clans and their wives.
Zechariah,13,1,"“On that day a fountain will be opened to the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to cleanse them from sin and impurity."
Zechariah,13,2,"“On that day, I will banish the names of the idols from the land, and they will be remembered no more,” declares the LORD Almighty. “I will remove both the prophets and the spirit of impurity from the land."
Zechariah,13,3,"And if anyone still prophesies, their father and mother, to whom they were born, will say to them, ‘You must die, because you have told lies in the LORD’s name.’ Then their own parents will stab the one who prophesies."
Zechariah,13,4,“On that day every prophet will be ashamed of their prophetic vision. They will not put on a prophet’s garment of hair in order to deceive.
Zechariah,13,5,"Each will say, ‘I am not a prophet. I am a farmer; the land has been my livelihood since my youth.’"
Zechariah,13,6,"If someone asks, ‘What are these wounds on your body?’ they will answer, ‘The wounds I was given at the house of my friends.’"
Zechariah,13,7,"“Awake, sword, against my shepherd, against the man who is close to me!” declares the LORD Almighty. “Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered, and I will turn my hand against the little ones."
Zechariah,13,8,"In the whole land,” declares the LORD, “two-thirds will be struck down and perish; yet one-third will be left in it."
Zechariah,13,9,"This third I will put into the fire; I will refine them like silver and test them like gold. They will call on my name and I will answer them; I will say, ‘They are my people,’ and they will say, ‘The LORD is our God.’”"
Zechariah,14,1,"A day of the LORD is coming, Jerusalem, when your possessions will be plundered and divided up within your very walls."
