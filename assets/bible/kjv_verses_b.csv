Luke,4,29,"And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong."
Luke,4,30,"But he passing through the midst of them went his way,"
Luke,4,31,"And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days."
Luke,4,32,And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.
Luke,4,33,"And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,"
Luke,4,34,"Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God."

Luke,4,43,"And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent."
Luke,4,44,And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.
Luke,5,1,"And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,"
Luke,5,2,"And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets."
Luke,5,3,"And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship."
Luke,5,4,"Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught."
Luke,5,5,"And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net."
Luke,5,6,"And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake."
Luke,5,7,"And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink."
Luke,5,8,"When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord."
Luke,5,9,"For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:"
Luke,5,10,"And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men."
Luke,5,11,"And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him."
Luke,5,12,"And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean."
Luke,5,13,"And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him."
Luke,5,14,"And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them."
Luke,5,15,"But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities."
Luke,5,16,"And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed."
Luke,5,17,"And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them."
Luke,5,18,"And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him."
Luke,5,19,"And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus."
Luke,5,20,"And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee."
Luke,5,21,"And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?"
Luke,5,22,"But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?"
Luke,5,23,"Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?"
Luke,5,24,"But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house."
Luke,5,25,"And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God."
Luke,5,26,"And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day."
Luke,5,27,"And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me."
Luke,5,28,"And he left all, rose up, and followed him."
Luke,5,29,And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.
Luke,5,30,"But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?"
Luke,5,31,"And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick."
Luke,5,32,"I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
Luke,5,33,"And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?"
Luke,5,34,"And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?"
Luke,5,35,"But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days."
Luke,5,36,"And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old."
Luke,5,37,"And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish."
Luke,5,38,But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.
Luke,5,39,"No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better."
Luke,6,1,"And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands."
Luke,6,2,"And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?"
Luke,6,3,"And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him;"
Luke,6,4,"How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?"
Luke,6,5,"And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath."
Luke,6,6,"And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered."
Luke,6,7,"And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him."
Luke,6,8,"But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth."
Luke,6,9,"Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?"
Luke,6,10,"And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other."
Luke,6,11,And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.
Luke,6,12,"And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God."
Luke,6,13,"And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;"
Luke,6,14,"Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,"
Luke,6,15,"Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,"
Luke,6,16,"And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor."
Luke,6,17,"And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;"
Luke,6,18,And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.
Luke,6,19,"And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all."
Luke,6,20,"And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God."
Luke,6,21,Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.
Luke,6,22,"Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake."
Luke,6,23,"Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets."
Luke,6,24,But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.
Luke,6,25,Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.
Luke,6,26,"Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets."
Luke,6,27,"But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,"
Luke,6,28,"Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you."
Luke,6,29,And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also.
Luke,6,30,Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.
Luke,6,31,"And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise."
Luke,6,32,"For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them."
Luke,6,33,"And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same."
Luke,6,34,"And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again."
Luke,6,35,"But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil."
Luke,6,36,"Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful."
Luke,6,37,"Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:"
Luke,6,38,"Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again."
Luke,6,39,"And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?"
Luke,6,40,The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.
Luke,6,41,"And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"
Luke,6,42,"Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye."
Luke,6,43,For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
Luke,6,44,"For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes."
Luke,6,45,A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.
Luke,6,46,"And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?"
Luke,6,47,"Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:"
Luke,6,48,"He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock."
Luke,6,49,"But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great."
Luke,7,1,"Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum."
Luke,7,2,"And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die."
Luke,7,3,"And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant."
Luke,7,4,"And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:"
Luke,7,5,"For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue."
Luke,7,6,"Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:"
Luke,7,7,"Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed."
Luke,7,8,"For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it."
Luke,7,9,"When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel."
Luke,7,10,"And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick."
Luke,7,11,"And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people."
Luke,7,12,"Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her."
Luke,7,13,"And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not."
Luke,7,14,"And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise."
Luke,7,15,"And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother."
Luke,7,16,"And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people."
Luke,7,17,"And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about."
Luke,7,18,And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.
Luke,7,19,"And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?"
Luke,7,20,"When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?"
Luke,7,21,"And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight."
Luke,7,22,"Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached."
Luke,7,23,"And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me."
Luke,7,24,"And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?"
Luke,7,25,"But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts."
Luke,7,26,"But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet."
Luke,7,27,"This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee."
Luke,7,28,"For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."
Luke,7,29,"And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John."
Luke,7,30,"But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him."
Luke,7,31,"And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?"
Luke,7,32,"They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept."
Luke,7,33,"For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil."
Luke,7,34,"The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!"
Luke,7,35,But wisdom is justified of all her children.
Luke,7,36,"And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat."
Luke,7,37,"And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,"
Luke,7,38,"And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment."
Luke,7,39,"Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner."
Luke,7,40,"And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on."
Luke,7,41,"There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty."
Luke,7,42,"And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?"
Luke,7,43,"Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged."
Luke,7,44,"And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head."
Luke,7,45,Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.
Luke,7,46,My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.
Luke,7,47,"Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little."
Luke,7,48,"And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven."
Luke,7,49,"And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?"
Luke,7,50,"And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace."
Luke,8,1,"And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,"
Luke,8,2,"And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,"
Luke,8,3,"And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance."
Luke,8,4,"And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:"
Luke,8,5,"A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it."
Luke,8,6,"And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture."
Luke,8,7,"And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it."
Luke,8,8,"And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."
Luke,8,9,"And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?"
Luke,8,10,"And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand."
Luke,8,11,Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
Luke,8,12,"Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved."
Luke,8,13,"They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away."
Luke,8,14,"And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection."
Luke,8,15,"But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience."
Luke,8,16,"No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light."
Luke,8,17,"For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad."
Luke,8,18,"Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have."
Luke,8,19,"Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press."
Luke,8,20,"And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee."
Luke,8,21,"And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it."
Luke,8,22,"Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth."
Luke,8,23,"But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy."
Luke,8,24,"And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm."
Luke,8,25,"And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him."
Luke,8,26,"And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee."
Luke,8,27,"And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs."
Luke,8,28,"When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not."
Luke,8,29,"(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)"
Luke,8,30,"And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him."
Luke,8,31,And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.
Luke,8,32,And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.
Luke,8,33,"Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked."
Luke,8,34,"When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country."
Luke,8,35,"Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid."
Luke,8,36,They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.
Luke,8,37,"Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again."
Luke,8,38,"Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,"
Luke,8,39,"Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him."
Luke,8,40,"And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him."
Luke,8,41,"And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:"
Luke,8,42,"For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him."
Luke,8,43,"And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,"
Luke,8,44,"Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched."
Luke,8,45,"And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?"
Luke,8,46,"And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me."
Luke,8,47,"And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately."
Luke,8,48,"And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace."
Luke,8,49,"While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master."
Luke,8,50,"But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole."
Luke,8,51,"And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden."
Luke,8,52,"And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth."
Luke,8,53,"And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead."
Luke,8,54,"And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise."
Luke,8,55,"And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat."
Luke,8,56,And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.
Luke,9,1,"Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases."
Luke,9,2,"And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick."
Luke,9,3,"And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece."
Luke,9,4,"And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart."
Luke,9,5,"And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them."
Luke,9,6,"And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where."
Luke,9,7,"Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;"
Luke,9,8,"And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again."
Luke,9,9,"And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him."
Luke,9,10,"And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida."
Luke,9,11,"And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing."
Luke,9,12,"And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place."
Luke,9,13,"But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people."
Luke,9,14,"For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company."
Luke,9,15,"And they did so, and made them all sit down."
Luke,9,16,"Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude."
Luke,9,17,"And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets."
Luke,9,18,"And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?"
Luke,9,19,"They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again."
Luke,9,20,"He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God."
Luke,9,21,"And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing;"
Luke,9,22,"Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day."
Luke,9,23,"And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me."
Luke,9,24,"For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it."
Luke,9,25,"For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?"
Luke,9,26,"For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels."
Luke,9,27,"But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God."
Luke,9,28,"And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray."
Luke,9,29,"And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering."
Luke,9,30,"And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:"
Luke,9,31,"Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem."
Luke,9,32,"But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him."
Luke,9,33,"And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said."
Luke,9,34,"While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud."
Luke,9,35,"And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him."
Luke,9,36,"And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen."
Luke,9,37,"And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him."
Luke,9,38,"And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child."
Luke,9,39,"And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him."
Luke,9,40,And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.
Luke,9,41,"And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither."
Luke,9,42,"And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father."
Luke,9,43,"And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,"
Luke,9,44,Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.
Luke,9,45,"But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying."
Luke,9,46,"Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest."
Luke,9,47,"And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,"
Luke,9,48,"And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great."
Luke,9,49,"And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us."
Luke,9,50,"And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us."
Luke,9,51,"And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,"
Luke,9,52,"And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him."
Luke,9,53,"And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem."
Luke,9,54,"And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?"
Luke,9,55,"But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of."
Luke,9,56,"For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another village."
Luke,9,57,"And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest."
Luke,9,58,"And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head."
Luke,9,59,"And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father."
Luke,9,60,"Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God."
Luke,9,61,"And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house."
Luke,9,62,"And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God."
Luke,10,1,"After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come."
Luke,10,2,"Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest."
Luke,10,3,"Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves."
Luke,10,4,"Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way."
Luke,10,5,"And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house."
Luke,10,6,"And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again."
Luke,10,7,"And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house."
Luke,10,8,"And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:"
Luke,10,9,"And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you."
Luke,10,10,"But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,"
Luke,10,11,"Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you."
Luke,10,12,"But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city."
Luke,10,13,"Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
Luke,10,14,"But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you."
Luke,10,15,"And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell."
Luke,10,16,He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.
Luke,10,17,"And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name."
Luke,10,18,"And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven."
Luke,10,19,"Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you."
Luke,10,20,"Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven."
Luke,10,21,"In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight."
Luke,10,22,"All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him."
Luke,10,23,"And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:"
Luke,10,24,"For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them."
Luke,10,25,"And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
Luke,10,26,"He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?"
Luke,10,27,"And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself."
Luke,10,28,"And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live."
Luke,10,29,"But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?"
Luke,10,30,"And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead."
Luke,10,31,"And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side."
Luke,10,32,"And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side."
Luke,10,33,"But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,"
Luke,10,34,"And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him."
Luke,10,35,"And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee."
Luke,10,36,"Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?"
Luke,10,37,"And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise."
Luke,10,38,"Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house."
Luke,10,39,"And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word."
Luke,10,40,"But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me."
Luke,10,41,"And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:"
Luke,10,42,"But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her."
Luke,11,1,"And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples."
Luke,11,2,"And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth."
Luke,11,3,Give us day by day our daily bread.
Luke,11,4,And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.
Luke,11,5,"And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;"
Luke,11,6,"For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?"
Luke,11,7,"And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee."
Luke,11,8,"I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth."
Luke,11,9,"And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you."
Luke,11,10,For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
Luke,11,11,"If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?"
Luke,11,12,"Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?"
Luke,11,13,"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?"
Luke,11,14,"And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered."
Luke,11,15,"But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils."
Luke,11,16,"And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven."
Luke,11,17,"But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth."
Luke,11,18,"If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub."
Luke,11,19,"And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges."
Luke,11,20,"But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you."
Luke,11,21,"When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:"
Luke,11,22,"But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils."
Luke,11,23,He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.
Luke,11,24,"When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out."
Luke,11,25,"And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished."
Luke,11,26,"Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first."
Luke,11,27,"And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked."
Luke,11,28,"But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it."
Luke,11,29,"And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet."
Luke,11,30,"For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation."
Luke,11,31,"The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here."
Luke,11,32,"The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here."
Luke,11,33,"No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light."
Luke,11,34,"The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness."
Luke,11,35,Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.
Luke,11,36,"If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light."
Luke,11,37,"And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat."
Luke,11,38,"And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner."
Luke,11,39,"And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness."
Luke,11,40,"Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?"
Luke,11,41,"But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you."
Luke,11,42,"But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone."
Luke,11,43,"Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets."
Luke,11,44,"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them."
Luke,11,45,"Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also."
Luke,11,46,"And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers."
Luke,11,47,"Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them."
Luke,11,48,"Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres."
Luke,11,49,"Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:"
Luke,11,50,"That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;"
Luke,11,51,"From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation."
Luke,11,52,"Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered."
Luke,11,53,"And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:"
Luke,11,54,"Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him."
Luke,12,1,"In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy."
Luke,12,2,"For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known."
Luke,12,3,Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.
Luke,12,4,"And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do."
Luke,12,5,"But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him."
Luke,12,6,"Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?"
Luke,12,7,But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.
Luke,12,8,"Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:"
Luke,12,9,But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.
Luke,12,10,"And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven."
Luke,12,11,"And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:"
Luke,12,12,For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.
Luke,12,13,"And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me."
Luke,12,14,"And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?"
Luke,12,15,"And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth."
Luke,12,16,"And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:"
Luke,12,17,"And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?"
Luke,12,18,"And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods."
Luke,12,19,"And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry."
Luke,12,20,"But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?"
Luke,12,21,"So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God."
Luke,12,22,"And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on."
Luke,12,23,"The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment."
Luke,12,24,Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?
Luke,12,25,And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?
Luke,12,26,"If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?"
Luke,12,27,"Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these."
Luke,12,28,"If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith?"
Luke,12,29,"And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind."
Luke,12,30,For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.
Luke,12,31,But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.
Luke,12,32,"Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom."
Luke,12,33,"Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth."
Luke,12,34,"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."
Luke,12,35,"Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;"
Luke,12,36,"And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately."
Luke,12,37,"Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them."
Luke,12,38,"And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants."
Luke,12,39,"And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through."
Luke,12,40,Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.
Luke,12,41,"Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all?"
Luke,12,42,"And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?"
Luke,12,43,"Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing."
Luke,12,44,"Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath."
Luke,12,45,"But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;"
Luke,12,46,"The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers."
Luke,12,47,"And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes."
Luke,12,48,"But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more."
Luke,12,49,"I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?"
Luke,12,50,But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!
Luke,12,51,"Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division:"
Luke,12,52,"For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three."
Luke,12,53,"The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law."
Luke,12,54,"And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is."
Luke,12,55,"And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat; and it cometh to pass."
Luke,12,56,"Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?"
Luke,12,57,"Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?"
Luke,12,58,"When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison."
Luke,12,59,"I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite."
Luke,13,1,"There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices."
Luke,13,2,"And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things?"
Luke,13,3,"I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish."
Luke,13,4,"Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?"
Luke,13,5,"I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish."
Luke,13,6,"He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none."
Luke,13,7,"Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?"
Luke,13,8,"And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:"
Luke,13,9,"And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down."
Luke,13,10,And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.
Luke,13,11,"And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself."
Luke,13,12,"And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity."
Luke,13,13,"And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God."
Luke,13,14,"And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day."
Luke,13,15,"The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?"
Luke,13,16,"And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?"
Luke,13,17,"And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him."
Luke,13,18,"Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it?"
Luke,13,19,"It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it."
Luke,13,20,"And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?"
Luke,13,21,"It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened."
Luke,13,22,"And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem."
Luke,13,23,"Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them,"
Luke,13,24,"Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able."
Luke,13,25,"When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:"
Luke,13,26,"Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets."
Luke,13,27,"But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity."
Luke,13,28,"There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out."
Luke,13,29,"And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God."
Luke,13,30,"And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last."
Luke,13,31,"The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee."
Luke,13,32,"And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected."
Luke,13,33,"Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem."
Luke,13,34,"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not!"
Luke,13,35,"Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord."
Luke,14,1,"And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him."
Luke,14,2,"And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy."
Luke,14,3,"And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?"
Luke,14,4,"And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go;"
Luke,14,5,"And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?"
Luke,14,6,And they could not answer him again to these things.
Luke,14,7,"And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them."
Luke,14,8,"When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him;"
Luke,14,9,"And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room."
Luke,14,10,"But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee."
Luke,14,11,For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
Luke,14,12,"Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee."
Luke,14,13,"But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:"
Luke,14,14,And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.
Luke,14,15,"And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God."
Luke,14,16,"Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:"
Luke,14,17,"And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready."
Luke,14,18,"And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused."
Luke,14,19,"And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused."
Luke,14,20,"And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come."
Luke,14,21,"So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind."
Luke,14,22,"And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room."
Luke,14,23,"And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled."
Luke,14,24,"For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper."
Luke,14,25,"And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them,"
Luke,14,26,"If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple."
Luke,14,27,"And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple."
Luke,14,28,"For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?"
Luke,14,29,"Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,"
Luke,14,30,"Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish."
Luke,14,31,"Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?"
Luke,14,32,"Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace."
Luke,14,33,"So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple."
Luke,14,34,"Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned?"
Luke,14,35,"It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."
Luke,15,1,Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.
Luke,15,2,"And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them."
Luke,15,3,"And he spake this parable unto them, saying,"
Luke,15,4,"What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?"
Luke,15,5,"And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing."
Luke,15,6,"And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost."
Luke,15,7,"I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance."
Luke,15,8,"Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it?"
Luke,15,9,"And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost."
Luke,15,10,"Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth."
Luke,15,11,"And he said, A certain man had two sons:"
Luke,15,12,"And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living."
Luke,15,13,"And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living."
Luke,15,14,"And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want."
Luke,15,15,And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
Luke,15,16,And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.
Luke,15,17,"And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!"
Luke,15,18,"I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,"
Luke,15,19,And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.
Luke,15,20,"And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him."
Luke,15,21,"And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son."
Luke,15,22,"But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:"
Luke,15,23,"And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:"
Luke,15,24,"For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry."
Luke,15,25,"Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing."
Luke,15,26,"And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant."
Luke,15,27,"And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound."
Luke,15,28,"And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him."
Luke,15,29,"And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:"
Luke,15,30,"But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf."
Luke,15,31,"And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine."
Luke,15,32,"It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found."
Luke,16,1,"And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods."
Luke,16,2,"And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward."
Luke,16,3,"Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed."
Luke,16,4,"I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses."
Luke,16,5,"So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?"
Luke,16,6,"And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty."
Luke,16,7,"Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore."
Luke,16,8,"And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light."
Luke,16,9,"And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations."
Luke,16,10,He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.
Luke,16,11,"If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?"
Luke,16,12,"And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?"
Luke,16,13,"No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon."
Luke,16,14,"And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him."
Luke,16,15,"And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God."
Luke,16,16,"The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it."
Luke,16,17,"And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail."
Luke,16,18,"Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery."
Luke,16,19,"There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:"
Luke,16,20,"And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,"
Luke,16,21,And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
Luke,16,22,"And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;"
Luke,16,23,"And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom."
Luke,16,24,"And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame."
Luke,16,25,"But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented."
Luke,16,26,"And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence."
Luke,16,27,"Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:"
Luke,16,28,"For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment."
Luke,16,29,"Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them."
Luke,16,30,"And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent."
Luke,16,31,"And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead."
Luke,17,1,"Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!"
Luke,17,2,"It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones."
Luke,17,3,"Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him."
Luke,17,4,"And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him."
Luke,17,5,"And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith."
Luke,17,6,"And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you."
Luke,17,7,"But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?"
Luke,17,8,"And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?"
Luke,17,9,Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.
Luke,17,10,"So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do."
Luke,17,11,"And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee."
Luke,17,12,"And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:"
Luke,17,13,"And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us."
Luke,17,14,"And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed."
Luke,17,15,"And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,"
Luke,17,16,"And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan."
Luke,17,17,"And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?"
Luke,17,18,"There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger."
Luke,17,19,"And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole."
Luke,17,20,"And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:"
Luke,17,21,"Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you."
Luke,17,22,"And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it."
Luke,17,23,"And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them."
Luke,17,24,"For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day."
Luke,17,25,"But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation."
Luke,17,26,"And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man."
Luke,17,27,"They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all."
Luke,17,28,"Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;"
Luke,17,29,"But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all."
Luke,17,30,Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.
Luke,17,31,"In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back."
Luke,17,32,Remember Lot's wife.
Luke,17,33,Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.
Luke,17,34,"I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left."
Luke,17,35,"Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left."
Luke,17,36,"Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left."
Luke,17,37,"And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together."
Luke,18,1,"And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;"
Luke,18,2,"Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:"
Luke,18,3,"And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary."
Luke,18,4,"And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;"
Luke,18,5,"Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me."
Luke,18,6,"And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith."
Luke,18,7,"And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?"
Luke,18,8,"I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?"
Luke,18,9,"And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:"
Luke,18,10,"Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican."
Luke,18,11,"The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican."
Luke,18,12,"I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess."
Luke,18,13,"And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner."
Luke,18,14,"I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted."
Luke,18,15,"And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them."
Luke,18,16,"But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God."
Luke,18,17,"Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein."
Luke,18,18,"And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
Luke,18,19,"And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God."
Luke,18,20,"Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother."
Luke,18,21,"And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up."
Luke,18,22,"Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me."
Luke,18,23,"And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich."
Luke,18,24,"And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!"
Luke,18,25,"For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."
Luke,18,26,"And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?"
Luke,18,27,"And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God."
Luke,18,28,"Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee."
Luke,18,29,"And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,"
Luke,18,30,"Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting."
Luke,18,31,"Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished."
Luke,18,32,"For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:"
Luke,18,33,"And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again."
Luke,18,34,"And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken."
Luke,18,35,"And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:"
Luke,18,36,"And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant."
Luke,18,37,"And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by."
Luke,18,38,"And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me."
Luke,18,39,"And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of David, have mercy on me."
Luke,18,40,"And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,"
Luke,18,41,"Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight."
Luke,18,42,"And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee."
Luke,18,43,"And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God."
Luke,19,1,And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.
Luke,19,2,"And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich."
Luke,19,3,"And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature."
Luke,19,4,"And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way."
Luke,19,5,"And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house."
Luke,19,6,"And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully."
Luke,19,7,"And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner."
Luke,19,8,"And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold."
Luke,19,9,"And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham."
Luke,19,10,For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.
Luke,19,11,"And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear."
Luke,19,12,"He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return."
Luke,19,13,"And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come."
Luke,19,14,"But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us."
Luke,19,15,"And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading."
Luke,19,16,"Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds."
Luke,19,17,"And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities."
Luke,19,18,"And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds."
Luke,19,19,"And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities."
Luke,19,20,"And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:"
Luke,19,21,"For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow."
Luke,19,22,"And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:"
Luke,19,23,"Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?"
Luke,19,24,"And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds."
Luke,19,25,"(And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)"
Luke,19,26,"For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him."
Luke,19,27,"But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me."
Luke,19,28,"And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem."
Luke,19,29,"And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,"
Luke,19,30,"Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither."
Luke,19,31,"And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him."
Luke,19,32,"And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them."
Luke,19,33,"And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?"
Luke,19,34,"And they said, The Lord hath need of him."
Luke,19,35,"And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon."
Luke,19,36,"And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way."
Luke,19,37,"And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;"
Luke,19,38,"Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest."
Luke,19,39,"And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples."
Luke,19,40,"And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out."
Luke,19,41,"And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,"
Luke,19,42,"Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes."
Luke,19,43,"For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,"
Luke,19,44,"And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation."
Luke,19,45,"And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;"
Luke,19,46,"Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves."
Luke,19,47,"And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,"
Luke,19,48,And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.
Luke,20,1,"And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,"
Luke,20,2,"And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?"
Luke,20,3,"And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:"
Luke,20,4,"The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?"
Luke,20,5,"And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?"
Luke,20,6,"But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet."
Luke,20,7,"And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was."
Luke,20,8,"And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things."
Luke,20,9,"Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time."
Luke,20,10,"And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty."
Luke,20,11,"And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty."
Luke,20,12,"And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out."
Luke,20,13,"Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him."
Luke,20,14,"But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours."
Luke,20,15,"So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?"
Luke,20,16,"He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid."
Luke,20,17,"And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?"
Luke,20,18,"Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder."
Luke,20,19,And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.
Luke,20,20,"And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor."
Luke,20,21,"And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly:"
Luke,20,22,"Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?"
Luke,20,23,"But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?"
Luke,20,24,"Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's."
Luke,20,25,"And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's."
Luke,20,26,"And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace."
Luke,20,27,"Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,"
Luke,20,28,"Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother."
Luke,20,29,"There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children."
Luke,20,30,"And the second took her to wife, and he died childless."
Luke,20,31,"And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died."
Luke,20,32,Last of all the woman died also.
Luke,20,33,Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.
Luke,20,34,"And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:"
Luke,20,35,"But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:"
Luke,20,36,"Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection."
Luke,20,37,"Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."
Luke,20,38,"For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him."
Luke,20,39,"Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said."
Luke,20,40,And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.
Luke,20,41,"And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son?"
Luke,20,42,"And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,"
Luke,20,43,Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.
Luke,20,44,"David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?"
Luke,20,45,"Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,"
Luke,20,46,"Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;"
Luke,20,47,"Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation."
Luke,21,1,"And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury."
Luke,21,2,And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.
Luke,21,3,"And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:"
Luke,21,4,For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.
Luke,21,5,"And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,"
Luke,21,6,"As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down."
Luke,21,7,"And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?"
Luke,21,8,"And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them."
Luke,21,9,"But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by."
Luke,21,10,"Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:"
Luke,21,11,"And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven."
Luke,21,12,"But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake."
Luke,21,13,And it shall turn to you for a testimony.
Luke,21,14,"Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer:"
Luke,21,15,"For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist."
Luke,21,16,"And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death."
Luke,21,17,And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.
Luke,21,18,But there shall not an hair of your head perish.
Luke,21,19,In your patience possess ye your souls.
Luke,21,20,"And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh."
Luke,21,21,Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.
Luke,21,22,"For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled."
Luke,21,23,"But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people."
Luke,21,24,"And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled."
Luke,21,25,"And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;"
Luke,21,26,"Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken."
Luke,21,27,And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
Luke,21,28,"And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh."
Luke,21,29,"And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;"
Luke,21,30,"When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand."
Luke,21,31,"So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand."
Luke,21,32,"Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled."
Luke,21,33,Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
Luke,21,34,"And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares."
Luke,21,35,For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.
Luke,21,36,"Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man."
Luke,21,37,"And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Olives."
Luke,21,38,"And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him."
Luke,22,1,"Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover."
Luke,22,2,And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.
Luke,22,3,"Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve."
Luke,22,4,"And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them."
Luke,22,5,"And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money."
Luke,22,6,"And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude."
Luke,22,7,"Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed."
Luke,22,8,"And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat."
Luke,22,9,"And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?"
Luke,22,10,"And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in."
Luke,22,11,"And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?"
Luke,22,12,And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.
Luke,22,13,"And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover."
Luke,22,14,"And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him."
Luke,22,15,"And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:"
Luke,22,16,"For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God."
Luke,22,17,"And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:"
Luke,22,18,"For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come."
Luke,22,19,"And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me."
Luke,22,20,"Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you."
Luke,22,21,"But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table."
Luke,22,22,"And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!"
Luke,22,23,"And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing."
Luke,22,24,"And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest."
Luke,22,25,"And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors."
Luke,22,26,"But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve."
Luke,22,27,"For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth."
Luke,22,28,Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.
Luke,22,29,"And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;"
Luke,22,30,"That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
Luke,22,31,"And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:"
Luke,22,32,"But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren."
Luke,22,33,"And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death."
Luke,22,34,"And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me."
Luke,22,35,"And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing."
Luke,22,36,"Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one."
Luke,22,37,"For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end."
Luke,22,38,"And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough."
Luke,22,39,"And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him."
Luke,22,40,"And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation."
Luke,22,41,"And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,"
Luke,22,42,"Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done."
Luke,22,43,"And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him."
Luke,22,44,And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
Luke,22,45,"And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,"
Luke,22,46,"And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation."
Luke,22,47,"And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him."
Luke,22,48,"But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?"
Luke,22,49,"When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?"
Luke,22,50,"And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear."
Luke,22,51,"And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him."
Luke,22,52,"Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?"
Luke,22,53,"When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness."
Luke,22,54,"Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off."
Luke,22,55,"And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them."
Luke,22,56,"But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him."
Luke,22,57,"And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not."
Luke,22,58,"And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not."
Luke,22,59,"And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean."
Luke,22,60,"And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew."
Luke,22,61,"And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice."
Luke,22,62,"And Peter went out, and wept bitterly."
Luke,22,63,"And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him."
Luke,22,64,"And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?"
Luke,22,65,And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.
Luke,22,66,"And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,"
Luke,22,67,"Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:"
Luke,22,68,"And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go."
Luke,22,69,Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.
Luke,22,70,"Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am."
Luke,22,71,"And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth."
Luke,23,1,"And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate."
Luke,23,2,"And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King."
Luke,23,3,"And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it."
Luke,23,4,"Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man."
Luke,23,5,"And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place."
Luke,23,6,"When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean."
Luke,23,7,"And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time."
Luke,23,8,"And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him."
Luke,23,9,Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.
Luke,23,10,And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.
Luke,23,11,"And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate."
Luke,23,12,And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.
Luke,23,13,"And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,"
Luke,23,14,"Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:"
Luke,23,15,"No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him."
Luke,23,16,"I will therefore chastise him, and release him."
Luke,23,17,(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
Luke,23,18,"And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:"
Luke,23,19,"(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)"
Luke,23,20,"Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them."
Luke,23,21,"But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him."
Luke,23,22,"And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go."
Luke,23,23,"And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed."
Luke,23,24,And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.
Luke,23,25,"And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will."
Luke,23,26,"And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus."
Luke,23,27,"And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him."
Luke,23,28,"But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children."
Luke,23,29,"For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck."
Luke,23,30,"Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us."
Luke,23,31,"For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?"
Luke,23,32,"And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death."
Luke,23,33,"And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left."
Luke,23,34,"Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots."
Luke,23,35,"And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God."
Luke,23,36,"And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,"
Luke,23,37,"And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself."
Luke,23,38,"And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
Luke,23,39,"And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us."
Luke,23,40,"But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?"
Luke,23,41,And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.
Luke,23,42,"And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom."
Luke,23,43,"And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in paradise."
Luke,23,44,"And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour."
Luke,23,45,"And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst."
Luke,23,46,"And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost."
Luke,23,47,"Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man."
Luke,23,48,"And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned."
Luke,23,49,"And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things."
Luke,23,50,"And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just:"
Luke,23,51,"(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God."
Luke,23,52,"This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus."
Luke,23,53,"And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid."
Luke,23,54,"And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on."
Luke,23,55,"And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid."
Luke,23,56,"And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment."
Luke,24,1,"Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them."
Luke,24,2,And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
Luke,24,3,"And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus."
Luke,24,4,"And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:"
Luke,24,5,"And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?"
Luke,24,6,"He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,"
Luke,24,7,"Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again."
Luke,24,8,"And they remembered his words,"
Luke,24,9,"And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest."
Luke,24,10,"It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles."
Luke,24,11,"And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not."
Luke,24,12,"Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass."
Luke,24,13,"And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs."
Luke,24,14,And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
Luke,24,15,"And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them."
Luke,24,16,But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.
Luke,24,17,"And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?"
Luke,24,18,"And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?"
Luke,24,19,"And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:"
Luke,24,20,"And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him."
Luke,24,21,"But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done."
Luke,24,22,"Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;"
Luke,24,23,"And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive."
Luke,24,24,"And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not."
Luke,24,25,"Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:"
Luke,24,26,"Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?"
Luke,24,27,"And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself."
Luke,24,28,"And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further."
Luke,24,29,"But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them."
Luke,24,30,"And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them."
Luke,24,31,"And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight."
Luke,24,32,"And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?"
Luke,24,33,"And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,"
Luke,24,34,"Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon."
Luke,24,35,"And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread."
Luke,24,36,"And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you."
Luke,24,37,"But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit."
Luke,24,38,"And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?"
Luke,24,39,"Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have."
Luke,24,40,"And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet."
Luke,24,41,"And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?"
Luke,24,42,"And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb."
Luke,24,43,"And he took it, and did eat before them."
Luke,24,44,"And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me."
Luke,24,45,"Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,"
Luke,24,46,"And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:"
Luke,24,47,"And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem."
Luke,24,48,And ye are witnesses of these things.
Luke,24,49,"And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high."
Luke,24,50,"And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them."
Luke,24,51,"And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven."
Luke,24,52,"And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:"
Luke,24,53,"And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen."
John,1,1,"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. "
John,1,2,The same was in the beginning with God. 
John,1,3,All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. 
John,1,4,In him was life; and the life was the light of men. 
John,1,5,And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. 
John,1,6,"There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. "
John,1,7,"The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe. "
John,1,8,"He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. "
John,1,9,"That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. "
John,1,10,"He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. "
John,1,11,"He came unto his own, and his own received him not. "
John,1,12,"But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: "
John,1,13,"Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. "
John,1,14,"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. "
John,1,15,"John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me. "
John,1,16,"And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. "
John,1,17,"For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. "
John,1,18,"No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. "
John,1,19,"And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou? "
John,1,20,"And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ. "
John,1,21,"And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No. "
John,1,22,"Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? "
John,1,23,"He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias. "
John,1,24,And they which were sent were of the Pharisees. 
John,1,25,"And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet? "
John,1,26,"John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not; "
John,1,27,"He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose. "
John,1,28,"These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing. "
John,1,29,"The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. "
John,1,30,"This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me. "
John,1,31,"And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water. "
John,1,32,"And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. "
John,1,33,"And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. "
John,1,34,"And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God. "
John,1,35,"Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples; "
John,1,36,"And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God! "
John,1,37,"And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. "
John,1,38,"Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou? "
John,1,39,"He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour. "
John,1,40,"One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. "
John,1,41,"He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ. "
John,1,42,"And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone. "
John,1,43,"The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me. "
John,1,44,"Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. "
John,1,45,"Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. "
John,1,46,"And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see. "
John,1,47,"Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! "
John,1,48,"Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee. "
John,1,49,"Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel. "
John,1,50,"Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these. "
John,1,51,"And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man."
John,2,1,And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: 
John,2,2,"And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. "
John,2,3,"And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. "
John,2,4,"Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. "
John,2,5,"His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. "
John,2,6,"And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. "
John,2,7,"Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. "
John,2,8,"And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it. "
John,2,9,"When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, "
John,2,10,"And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now. "
John,2,11,"This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him. "
John,2,12,"After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days. "
John,2,13,"And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. "
John,2,14,"And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: "
John,2,15,"And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; "
John,2,16,"And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise. "
John,2,17,"And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up. "
John,2,18,"Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things? "
John,2,19,"Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. "
John,2,20,"Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? "
John,2,21,But he spake of the temple of his body. 
John,2,22,"When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said. "
John,2,23,"Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did. "
John,2,24,"But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, "
John,2,25,And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.
John,3,1,"There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews: "
John,3,2,"The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him. "
John,3,3,"Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. "
John,3,4,"Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? "
John,3,5,"Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. "
John,3,6,That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. 
John,3,7,"Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. "
John,3,8,"The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. "
John,3,9,"Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? "
John,3,10,"Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? "
John,3,11,"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. "
John,3,12,"If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things? "
John,3,13,"And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. "
John,3,14,"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: "
John,3,15,"That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. "
John,3,16,"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. "
John,3,17,For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. 
John,3,18,"He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. "
John,3,19,"And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. "
John,3,20,"For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. "
John,3,21,"But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. "
John,3,22,"After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized. "
John,3,23,"And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized. "
John,3,24,For John was not yet cast into prison. 
John,3,25,Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying. 
John,3,26,"And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him. "
John,3,27,"John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven. "
John,3,28,"Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him. "
John,3,29,"He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled. "
John,3,30,"He must increase, but I must decrease. "
John,3,31,"He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all. "
John,3,32,"And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony. "
John,3,33,He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true. 
John,3,34,For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him. 
John,3,35,"The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. "
John,3,36,He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.
John,4,1,"When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, "
John,4,2,"(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,) "
John,4,3,"He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee. "
John,4,4,And he must needs go through Samaria. 
John,4,5,"Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. "
John,4,6,"Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour. "
John,4,7,"There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. "
John,4,8,(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.) 
John,4,9,"Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. "
John,4,10,"Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. "
John,4,11,"The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? "
John,4,12,"Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? "
John,4,13,"Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: "
John,4,14,But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. 
John,4,15,"The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. "
John,4,16,"Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. "
John,4,17,"The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: "
John,4,18,For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. 
John,4,19,"The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. "
John,4,20,"Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. "
John,4,21,"Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. "
John,4,22,Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. 
John,4,23,"But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. "
John,4,24,God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. 
John,4,25,"The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. "
John,4,26,"Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. "
John,4,27,"And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her? "
John,4,28,"The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men, "
John,4,29,"Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? "
John,4,30,"Then they went out of the city, and came unto him. "
John,4,31,"In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. "
John,4,32,"But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. "
John,4,33,"Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat? "
John,4,34,"Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. "
John,4,35,"Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. "
John,4,36,"And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. "
John,4,37,"And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. "
John,4,38,"I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours. "
John,4,39,"And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did. "
John,4,40,"So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. "
John,4,41,And many more believed because of his own word; 
John,4,42,"And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world. "
John,4,43,"Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee. "
John,4,44,"For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country. "
John,4,45,"Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast. "
John,4,46,"So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. "
John,4,47,"When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death. "
John,4,48,"Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. "
John,4,49,"The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. "
John,4,50,"Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way. "
John,4,51,"And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth. "
John,4,52,"Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. "
John,4,53,"So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house. "
John,4,54,"This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee."
John,5,1,After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
John,5,2,"Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. "
John,5,3,"In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. "
John,5,4,"For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. "
John,5,5,"And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years. "
John,5,6,"When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole? "
John,5,7,"The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me. "
John,5,8,"Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. "
John,5,9,"And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath. "
John,5,10,"The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed. "
John,5,11,"He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk. "
John,5,12,"Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk? "
John,5,13,"And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place. "
John,5,14,"Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee. "
John,5,15,"The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole. "
John,5,16,"And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day. "
John,5,17,"But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work. "
John,5,18,"Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God. "
John,5,19,"Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. "
John,5,20,"For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. "
John,5,21,"For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. "
John,5,22,"For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: "
John,5,23,"That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. "
John,5,24,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. "
John,5,25,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. "
John,5,26,For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; 
John,5,27,"And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. "
John,5,28,"Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, "
John,5,29,"And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation. "
John,5,30,"I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me. "
John,5,31,"If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. "
John,5,32,There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. 
John,5,33,"Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth. "
John,5,34,"But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved. "
John,5,35,He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light. 
John,5,36,"But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me. "
John,5,37,"And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape. "
John,5,38,"And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not. "
John,5,39,Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. 
John,5,40,"And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. "
John,5,41,I receive not honour from men. 
John,5,42,"But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. "
John,5,43,"I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. "
John,5,44,"How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only? "
John,5,45,"Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust. "
John,5,46,"For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me. "
John,5,47,"But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?"
John,6,1,"After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias. "
John,6,2,"And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased. "
John,6,3,"And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples. "
John,6,4,"And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh. "
John,6,5,"When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat? "
John,6,6,And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do. 
John,6,7,"Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little. "
John,6,8,"One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him, "
John,6,9,"There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many? "
John,6,10,"And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. "
John,6,11,"And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would. "
John,6,12,"When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost. "
John,6,13,"Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten. "
John,6,14,"Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world. "
John,6,15,"When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone. "
John,6,16,"And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea, "
John,6,17,"And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them. "
John,6,18,And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew. 
John,6,19,"So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid. "
John,6,20,"But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid. "
John,6,21,Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went. 
John,6,22,"The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone; "
John,6,23,"(Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:) "
John,6,24,"When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus. "
John,6,25,"And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither? "
John,6,26,"Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled. "
John,6,27,"Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed. "
John,6,28,"Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? "
John,6,29,"Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. "
John,6,30,"They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work? "
John,6,31,"Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat. "
John,6,32,"Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. "
John,6,33,"For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world. "
John,6,34,"Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. "
John,6,35,"And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. "
John,6,36,"But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not. "
John,6,37,All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. 
John,6,38,"For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. "
John,6,39,"And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. "
John,6,40,"And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day. "
John,6,41,"The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven. "
John,6,42,"And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven? "
John,6,43,"Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves. "
John,6,44,"No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day. "
John,6,45,"It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me. "
John,6,46,"Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father. "
John,6,47,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life. "
John,6,48,I am that bread of life. 
John,6,49,"Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. "
John,6,50,"This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. "
John,6,51,"I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. "
John,6,52,"The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat? "
John,6,53,"Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. "
John,6,54,"Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. "
John,6,55,"For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. "
John,6,56,"He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. "
John,6,57,"As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me. "
John,6,58,"This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever. "
John,6,59,"These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum. "
John,6,60,"Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it? "
John,6,61,"When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you? "
John,6,62,What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before? 
John,6,63,"It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life. "
John,6,64,"But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him. "
John,6,65,"And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father. "
John,6,66,"From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. "
John,6,67,"Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away? "
John,6,68,"Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. "
John,6,69,"And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God. "
John,6,70,"Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil? "
John,6,71,"He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve."
John,7,1,"After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him. "
John,7,2,Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand. 
John,7,3,"His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest. "
John,7,4,"For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world. "
John,7,5,For neither did his brethren believe in him. 
John,7,6,"Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready. "
John,7,7,"The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil. "
John,7,8,Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time is not yet full come. 
John,7,9,"When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee. "
John,7,10,"But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. "
John,7,11,"Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? "
John,7,12,"And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people. "
John,7,13,Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews. 
John,7,14,"Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. "
John,7,15,"And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? "
John,7,16,"Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. "
John,7,17,"If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. "
John,7,18,"He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. "
John,7,19,"Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me? "
John,7,20,"The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee? "
John,7,21,"Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel. "
John,7,22,"Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man. "
John,7,23,"If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day? "
John,7,24,"Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment. "
John,7,25,"Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill? "
John,7,26,"But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ? "
John,7,27,"Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is. "
John,7,28,"Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. "
John,7,29,"But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me. "
John,7,30,"Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come. "
John,7,31,"And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done? "
John,7,32,The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him. 
John,7,33,"Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me. "
John,7,34,"Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come. "
John,7,35,"Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles? "
John,7,36,"What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come? "
John,7,37,"In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. "
John,7,38,"He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. "
John,7,39,"(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.) "
John,7,40,"Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet. "
John,7,41,"Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee? "
John,7,42,"Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was? "
John,7,43,So there was a division among the people because of him. 
John,7,44,And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him. 
John,7,45,"Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him? "
John,7,46,"The officers answered, Never man spake like this man. "
John,7,47,"Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived? "
John,7,48,Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him? 
John,7,49,But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed. 
John,7,50,"Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,) "
John,7,51,"Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth? "
John,7,52,"They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet. "
John,7,53,And every man went unto his own house.
John,8,1,Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. 
John,8,2,"And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them. "
John,8,3,"And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst, "
John,8,4,"They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. "
John,8,5,"Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou? "
John,8,6,"This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not. "
John,8,7,"So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. "
John,8,8,"And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. "
John,8,9,"And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. "
John,8,10,"When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? "
John,8,11,"She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more. "
John,8,12,"Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. "
John,8,13,"The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true. "
John,8,14,"Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go. "
John,8,15,Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man. 
John,8,16,"And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me. "
John,8,17,"It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. "
John,8,18,"I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me. "
John,8,19,"Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also. "
John,8,20,"These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come. "
John,8,21,"Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come. "
John,8,22,"Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come. "
John,8,23,"And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world. "
John,8,24,"I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins. "
John,8,25,"Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning. "
John,8,26,I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him. 
John,8,27,They understood not that he spake to them of the Father. 
John,8,28,"Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. "
John,8,29,And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him. 
John,8,30,"As he spake these words, many believed on him. "
John,8,31,"Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; "
John,8,32,"And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. "
John,8,33,"They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? "
John,8,34,"Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. "
John,8,35,And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever. 
John,8,36,"If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. "
John,8,37,"I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you. "
John,8,38,I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father. 
John,8,39,"They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham. "
John,8,40,"But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. "
John,8,41,"Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God. "
John,8,42,"Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. "
John,8,43,Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. 
John,8,44,"Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. "
John,8,45,"And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. "
John,8,46,"Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me? "
John,8,47,"He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God. "
John,8,48,"Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? "
John,8,49,"Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me. "
John,8,50,And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth. 
John,8,51,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death. "
John,8,52,"Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death. "
John,8,53,"Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself? "
John,8,54,"Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God: "
John,8,55,"Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying. "
John,8,56,"Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad. "
John,8,57,"Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? "
John,8,58,"Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. "
John,8,59,"Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by."
John,9,1,"And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth. "
John,9,2,"And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? "
John,9,3,"Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. "
John,9,4,"I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. "
John,9,5,"As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. "
John,9,6,"When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, "
John,9,7,"And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing. "
John,9,8,"The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? "
John,9,9,"Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he. "
John,9,10,"Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened? "
John,9,11,"He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight. "
John,9,12,"Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not. "
John,9,13,They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. 
John,9,14,"And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. "
John,9,15,"Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see. "
John,9,16,"Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them. "
John,9,17,"They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet. "
John,9,18,"But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight. "
John,9,19,"And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see? "
John,9,20,"His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: "
John,9,21,"But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself. "
John,9,22,"These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. "
John,9,23,"Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. "
John,9,24,"Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner. "
John,9,25,"He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. "
John,9,26,"Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes? "
John,9,27,"He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples? "
John,9,28,"Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples. "
John,9,29,"We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is. "
John,9,30,"The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes. "
John,9,31,"Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. "
John,9,32,Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. 
John,9,33,"If this man were not of God, he could do nothing. "
John,9,34,"They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. "
John,9,35,"Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? "
John,9,36,"He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? "
John,9,37,"And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. "
John,9,38,"And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. "
John,9,39,"And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind. "
John,9,40,"And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also? "
John,9,41,"Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth."
John,10,1,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. "
John,10,2,But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 
John,10,3,"To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. "
John,10,4,"And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. "
John,10,5,"And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers. "
John,10,6,This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them. 
John,10,7,"Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. "
John,10,8,All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. 
John,10,9,"I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. "
John,10,10,"The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. "
John,10,11,I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. 
John,10,12,"But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. "
John,10,13,"The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep. "
John,10,14,"I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. "
John,10,15,"As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. "
John,10,16,"And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd. "
John,10,17,"Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. "
John,10,18,"No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father. "
John,10,19,There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings. 
John,10,20,"And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him? "
John,10,21,"Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind? "
John,10,22,"And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter. "
John,10,23,And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch. 
John,10,24,"Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. "
John,10,25,"Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me. "
John,10,26,"But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you. "
John,10,27,"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: "
John,10,28,"And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. "
John,10,29,"My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. "
John,10,30,I and my Father are one. 
John,10,31,Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. 
John,10,32,"Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? "
John,10,33,"The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God. "
John,10,34,"Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? "
John,10,35,"If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken; "
John,10,36,"Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God? "
John,10,37,"If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. "
John,10,38,"But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him. "
John,10,39,"Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand, "
John,10,40,And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode. 
John,10,41,"And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true. "
John,10,42,And many believed on him there.
John,11,1,"Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha. "
John,11,2,"(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.) "
John,11,3,"Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. "
John,11,4,"When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby. "
John,11,5,"Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. "
John,11,6,"When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was. "
John,11,7,"Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again. "
John,11,8,"His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again? "
John,11,9,"Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world. "
John,11,10,"But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him. "
John,11,11,"These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. "
John,11,12,"Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. "
John,11,13,Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. 
John,11,14,"Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. "
John,11,15,"And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him. "
John,11,16,"Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him. "
John,11,17,"Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already. "
John,11,18,"Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off: "
John,11,19,"And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother. "
John,11,20,"Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house. "
John,11,21,"Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. "
John,11,22,"But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee. "
John,11,23,"Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. "
John,11,24,"Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. "
John,11,25,"Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: "
John,11,26,And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this? 
John,11,27,"She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world."
John,11,28,"And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee. "
John,11,29,"As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him. "
John,11,30,"Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him. "
John,11,31,"The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there. "
John,11,32,"Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. "
John,11,33,"When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled. "
John,11,34,"And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see. "
John,11,35,Jesus wept. 
John,11,36,"Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! "
John,11,37,"And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died? "
John,11,38,"Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. "
John,11,39,"Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days. "
John,11,40,"Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? "
John,11,41,"Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. "
John,11,42,"And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me. "
John,11,43,"And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. "
John,11,44,"And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go. "
John,11,45,"Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him. "
John,11,46,"But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done. "
John,11,47,"Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. "
John,11,48,"If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation. "
John,11,49,"And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, "
John,11,50,"Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. "
John,11,51,"And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; "
John,11,52,"And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad. "
John,11,53,Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death. 
John,11,54,"Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples. "
John,11,55,"And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves. "
John,11,56,"Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast? "
John,11,57,"Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him."
John,12,1,"Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. "
John,12,2,There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him. 
John,12,3,"Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. "
John,12,4,"Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him, "
John,12,5,"Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? "
John,12,6,"This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein. "
John,12,7,"Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this. "
John,12,8,For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always. 
John,12,9,"Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. "
John,12,10,But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death; 
John,12,11,"Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus. "
John,12,12,"On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, "
John,12,13,"Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord. "
John,12,14,"And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written, "
John,12,15,"Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt. "
John,12,16,"These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him. "
John,12,17,"The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record. "
John,12,18,"For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle. "
John,12,19,"The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him. "
John,12,20,And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast: 
John,12,21,"The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus. "
John,12,22,Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus. 
John,12,23,"And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. "
John,12,24,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. "
John,12,25,He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. 
John,12,26,"If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour. "
John,12,27,"Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. "
John,12,28,"Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. "
John,12,29,"The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him. "
John,12,30,"Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. "
John,12,31,Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. 
John,12,32,"And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. "
John,12,33,"This he said, signifying what death he should die. "
John,12,34,"The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man? "
John,12,35,"Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. "
John,12,36,"While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them. "
John,12,37,"But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him: "
John,12,38,"That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? "
John,12,39,"Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again, "
John,12,40,"He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them. "
John,12,41,"These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him. "
John,12,42,"Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: "
John,12,43,For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God. 
John,12,44,"Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. "
John,12,45,And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me. 
John,12,46,"I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness. "
John,12,47,"And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. "
John,12,48,"He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. "
John,12,49,"For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. "
John,12,50,"And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak."
John,13,1,"Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. "
John,13,2,"And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him; "
John,13,3,"Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; "
John,13,4,"He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself. "
John,13,5,"After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. "
John,13,6,"Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? "
John,13,7,"Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. "
John,13,8,"Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. "
John,13,9,"Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. "
John,13,10,"Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. "
John,13,11,"For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean. "
John,13,12,"So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? "
John,13,13,Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. 
John,13,14,"If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. "
John,13,15,"For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you. "
John,13,16,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. "
John,13,17,"If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them. "
John,13,18,"I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me. "
John,13,19,"Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he. "
John,13,20,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. "
John,13,21,"When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. "
John,13,22,"Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake. "
John,13,23,"Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. "
John,13,24,"Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake. "
John,13,25,"He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it? "
John,13,26,"Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. "
John,13,27,"And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly. "
John,13,28,Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him. 
John,13,29,"For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor. "
John,13,30,He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night. 
John,13,31,"Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. "
John,13,32,"If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him. "
John,13,33,"Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you. "
John,13,34,"A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. "
John,13,35,"By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. "
John,13,36,"Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards. "
John,13,37,"Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake. "
John,13,38,"Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice."
John,14,1,"Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. "
John,14,2,"In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. "
John,14,3,"And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. "
John,14,4,"And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know. "
John,14,5,"Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? "
John,14,6,"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. "
John,14,7,"If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. "
John,14,8,"Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us. "
John,14,9,"Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father? "
John,14,10,"Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. "
John,14,11,"Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake. "
John,14,12,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. "
John,14,13,"And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. "
John,14,14,"If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it. "
John,14,15,"If ye love me, keep my commandments. "
John,14,16,"And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; "
John,14,17,"Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. "
John,14,18,I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. 
John,14,19,"Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also. "
John,14,20,"At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you. "
John,14,21,"He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. "
John,14,22,"Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? "
John,14,23,"Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. "
John,14,24,"He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me. "
John,14,25,"These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. "
John,14,26,"But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. "
John,14,27,"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. "
John,14,28,"Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I. "
John,14,29,"And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe. "
John,14,30,"Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me. "
John,14,31,"But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence."
John,15,1,"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. "
John,15,2,"Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. "
John,15,3,Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. 
John,15,4,"Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. "
John,15,5,"I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. "
John,15,6,"If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. "
John,15,7,"If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. "
John,15,8,"Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples. "
John,15,9,"As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love. "
John,15,10,"If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love. "
John,15,11,"These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full. "
John,15,12,"This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. "
John,15,13,"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. "
John,15,14,"Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. "
John,15,15,Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you. 
John,15,16,"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. "
John,15,17,"These things I command you, that ye love one another. "
John,15,18,"If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. "
John,15,19,"If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. "
John,15,20,"Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. "
John,15,21,"But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me. "
John,15,22,"If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin. "
John,15,23,He that hateth me hateth my Father also. 
John,15,24,"If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father. "
John,15,25,"But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause. "
John,15,26,"But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me: "
John,15,27,"And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning."
John,16,1,"These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended. "
John,16,2,"They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service. "
John,16,3,"And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me. "
John,16,4,"But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you. "
John,16,5,"But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? "
John,16,6,"But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart. "
John,16,7,"Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. "
John,16,8,"And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: "
John,16,9,"Of sin, because they believe not on me; "
John,16,10,"Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; "
John,16,11,"Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged. "
John,16,12,"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. "
John,16,13,"Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. "
John,16,14,"He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you. "
John,16,15,"All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you. "
John,16,16,"A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father. "
John,16,17,"Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father? "
John,16,18,"They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith. "
John,16,19,"Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me? "
John,16,20,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. "
John,16,21,"A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world. "
John,16,22,"And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you. "
John,16,23,"And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. "
John,16,24,"Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full. "
John,16,25,"These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father. "
John,16,26,"At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: "
John,16,27,"For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God. "
John,16,28,"I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father. "
John,16,29,"His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb. "
John,16,30,"Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God. "
John,16,31,"Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe? "
John,16,32,"Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. "
John,16,33,"These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world."
John,17,1,"These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: "
John,17,2,"As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him. "
John,17,3,"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. "
John,17,4,I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. 
John,17,5,"And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was. "
John,17,6,"I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word. "
John,17,7,Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee. 
John,17,8,"For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me. "
John,17,9,"I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine. "
John,17,10,"And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them. "
John,17,11,"And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are. "
John,17,12,"While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled. "
John,17,13,"And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves. "
John,17,14,"I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. "
John,17,15,"I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. "
John,17,16,"They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. "
John,17,17,Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. 
John,17,18,"As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. "
John,17,19,"And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. "
John,17,20,"Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; "
John,17,21,"That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. "
John,17,22,"And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: "
John,17,23,"I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me. "
John,17,24,"Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world. "
John,17,25,"O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me. "
John,17,26,"And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them."
John,18,1,"When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples. "
John,18,2,"And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples. "
John,18,3,"Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons. "
John,18,4,"Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye? "
John,18,5,"They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them. "
John,18,6,"As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground. "
John,18,7,"Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth. "
John,18,8,"Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way: "
John,18,9,"That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none. "
John,18,10,"Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus. "
John,18,11,"Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? "
John,18,12,"Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him, "
John,18,13,"And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year. "
John,18,14,"Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people. "
John,18,15,"And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest. "
John,18,16,"But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter. "
John,18,17,"Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not. "
John,18,18,"And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself. "
John,18,19,"The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine. "
John,18,20,"Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing. "
John,18,21,"Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said. "
John,18,22,"And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? "
John,18,23,"Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me? "
John,18,24,Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest. 
John,18,25,"And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not. "
John,18,26,"One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him? "
John,18,27,Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew. 
John,18,28,"Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover. "
John,18,29,"Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man? "
John,18,30,"They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee. "
John,18,31,"Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death: "
John,18,32,"That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die. "
John,18,33,"Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews? "
John,18,34,"Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me? "
John,18,35,"Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done? "
John,18,36,"Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. "
John,18,37,"Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. "
John,18,38,"Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all. "
John,18,39,"But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews? "
John,18,40,"Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber."
John,19,1,"Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him. "
John,19,2,"And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe, "
John,19,3,"And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands. "
John,19,4,"Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him. "
John,19,5,"Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man! "
John,19,6,"When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him. "
John,19,7,"The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. "
John,19,8,"When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid; "
John,19,9,"And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. "
John,19,10,"Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee? "
John,19,11,"Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin. "
John,19,12,"And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar. "
John,19,13,"When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. "
John,19,14,"And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King! "
John,19,15,"But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar. "
John,19,16,"Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away. "
John,19,17,"And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha: "
John,19,18,"Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst. "
John,19,19,"And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS. "
John,19,20,"This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin. "
John,19,21,"Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. "
John,19,22,"Pilate answered, What I have written I have written. "
John,19,23,"Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout. "
John,19,24,"They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did. "
John,19,25,"Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. "
John,19,26,"When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son! "
John,19,27,"Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home. "
John,19,28,"After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst. "
John,19,29,"Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth. "
John,19,30,"When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost. "
John,19,31,"The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. "
John,19,32,"Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him. "
John,19,33,"But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs: "
John,19,34,"But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water. "
John,19,35,"And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe. "
John,19,36,"For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken. "
John,19,37,"And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced. "
John,19,38,"And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus. "
John,19,39,"9And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight. "
John,19,40,"Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. "
John,19,41,"Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid. "
John,19,42,There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.
John,20,1,"The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre. "
John,20,2,"Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him. "
John,20,3,"Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre. "
John,20,4,"So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. "
John,20,5,"And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. "
John,20,6,"Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, "
John,20,7,"And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. "
John,20,8,"Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed. "
John,20,9,"For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead. "
John,20,10,Then the disciples went away again unto their own home. 
John,20,11,"But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre, "
John,20,12,"And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. "
John,20,13,"And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they have laid him. "
John,20,14,"And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. "
John,20,15,"Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. "
John,20,16,"Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. "
John,20,17,"Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God. "
John,20,18,"Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the LORD, and that he had spoken these things unto her. "
John,20,19,"Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. "
John,20,20,"And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD. "
John,20,21,"Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. "
John,20,22,"And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost: "
John,20,23,"Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained. "
John,20,24,"But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. "
John,20,25,"The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the LORD. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe. "
John,20,26,"And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you. "
John,20,27,"Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. "
John,20,28,"And Thomas answered and said unto him, My LORD and my God. "
John,20,29,"Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. "
John,20,30,"And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book: "
John,20,31,"But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name."
John,21,1,After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself. 
John,21,2,"There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples. "
John,21,3,"Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing. "
John,21,4,"But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. "
John,21,5,"Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No. "
John,21,6,"And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. "
John,21,7,"Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea. "
John,21,8,"And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes. "
John,21,9,"As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread. "
John,21,10,"Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught. "
John,21,11,"Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken. "
John,21,12,"Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. "
John,21,13,"Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise. "
John,21,14,"This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead. "
John,21,15,"So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs. "
John,21,16,"He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep. "
John,21,17,"He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep. "
John,21,18,"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdest thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not. "
John,21,19,"This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me. "
John,21,20,"Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee? "
John,21,21,"Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? "
John,21,22,"Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me. "
John,21,23,"Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? "
John,21,24,"This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true. "
John,21,25,"And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen."
Acts,1,1,"The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,"
Acts,1,2,"Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:"

Acts,3,4,"And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us."
Acts,3,5,"And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them."
Acts,3,6,"Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk."
Acts,3,7,"And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength."
Acts,3,8,"And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God."
Acts,3,9,And all the people saw him walking and praising God:
Acts,3,10,And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.
Acts,3,11,"And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering."

Acts,3,21,"Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began."
Acts,3,22,"For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you."
Acts,3,23,"And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people."

Acts,4,2,"Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead."
Acts,4,3,"And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide."
Acts,4,4,Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.
Acts,4,5,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,"

Acts,4,9,"If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;"

Acts,4,19,"But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye."
Acts,4,20,For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.
Acts,4,21,"So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done."
Acts,4,22,"For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed."
Acts,4,23,"And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them."

Acts,4,32,And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.
Acts,4,33,And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.
Acts,4,34,"Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,"
Acts,4,35,And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.
Acts,4,36,"And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,"

Acts,5,19,"But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,"
Acts,5,20,"Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life."
Acts,5,21,"And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought."
Acts,5,22,"But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned and told,"
Acts,5,23,"Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within."
Acts,5,24,"Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow."
Acts,5,25,"Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people."
Acts,5,26,"Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned."
Acts,5,27,"And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,"

Acts,5,34,"Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;"
Acts,5,35,"And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men."
Acts,5,36,"For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought."
Acts,5,37,"After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed."
Acts,5,38,"And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:"

Acts,7,3,"And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee."
Acts,7,4,"Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell."
Acts,7,5,"And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child."
Acts,7,6,"And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years."

Acts,8,34,"And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?"
Acts,8,35,"Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus."

Acts,8,37,"And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."
Acts,8,38,"And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him."
Acts,8,39,"And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing."

Acts,9,2,"And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem."
Acts,9,3,"And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:"
Acts,9,4,"And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"
Acts,9,5,"And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks."
Acts,9,6,"And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do."
Acts,9,7,"And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man."
Acts,9,8,"And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus."
Acts,9,9,"And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink."
Acts,9,10,"And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord."
Acts,9,11,"And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,"
Acts,9,12,"And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight."
Acts,9,13,"Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:"
Acts,9,14,And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.
Acts,9,15,"But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:"
Acts,9,16,For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.
Acts,9,17,"And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost."
Acts,9,18,"And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized."
Acts,9,19,"And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus."
Acts,9,20,"And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God."
Acts,9,21,"But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?"
Acts,9,22,"But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ."
Acts,9,23,"And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:"
Acts,9,24,But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.
Acts,9,25,"Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket."
Acts,9,26,"And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple."
Acts,9,27,"But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus."
Acts,9,28,And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.
Acts,9,29,"And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him."
Acts,9,30,"Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus."
Acts,9,31,"Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied."

Acts,9,35,"And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord."
Acts,9,36,"Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did."
Acts,9,37,"And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber."
Acts,9,38,"And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them."
Acts,9,39,"Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them."
Acts,9,40,"But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up."
Acts,9,41,"And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive."
Acts,9,42,And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.
Acts,9,43,"And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner."
Acts,10,1,"There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,"
Acts,10,2,"A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway."
Acts,10,3,"He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius."
Acts,10,4,"And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God."
Acts,10,5,"And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter:"
Acts,10,6,"He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do."
Acts,10,7,"And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;"
Acts,10,8,"And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa."
Acts,10,9,"On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:"
Acts,10,10,"And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,"
Acts,10,11,"And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending upon him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:"
Acts,10,12,"Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air."
Acts,10,13,"And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat."
Acts,10,14,"But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean."
Acts,10,15,"And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common."
Acts,10,16,This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.
Acts,10,17,"Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate,"
Acts,10,18,"And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there."
Acts,10,19,"While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee."
Acts,10,20,"Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them."
Acts,10,21,"Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?"
Acts,10,22,"And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee."
Acts,10,23,"Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him."
Acts,10,24,"And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and he had called together his kinsmen and near friends."
Acts,10,25,"And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him."
Acts,10,26,"But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man."
Acts,10,27,"And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together."
Acts,10,28,"And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean."
Acts,10,29,"Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?"
Acts,10,30,"And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,"
Acts,10,31,"And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God."
Acts,10,32,"Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee."
Acts,10,33,"Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God."
Acts,10,34,"Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:"
Acts,10,35,"But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him."
Acts,10,36,"The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)"

Acts,10,41,"Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead."

Acts,10,45,"And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost."
Acts,10,46,"For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,"
Acts,10,47,"Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?"
Acts,10,48,And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.
Acts,11,1,And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.
Acts,11,2,"And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,"
Acts,11,3,"Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them."
Acts,11,4,"But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying,"
Acts,11,5,"I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:"

Acts,11,7,"And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat."
Acts,11,8,"But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth."

Acts,11,10,And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.
Acts,11,11,"And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me."
Acts,11,12,"And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:"
Acts,11,13,"And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;"
Acts,11,14,"Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved."
Acts,11,15,"And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning."
Acts,11,16,"Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost."
Acts,11,17,"Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?"

Acts,12,4,"And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people."
Acts,12,5,Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.
Acts,12,6,"And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison."

Acts,14,20,"Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe."
Acts,14,21,"And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,"
Acts,14,22,"Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God."

Acts,15,1,"And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved."
Acts,15,2,"When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question."
Acts,15,3,"And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren."
Acts,15,4,"And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them."
Acts,15,5,"But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses."
Acts,15,6,And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.
Acts,15,7,"And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe."

Acts,15,9,"And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith."
Acts,15,10,"Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?"
Acts,15,11,"But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they."

Acts,15,16,"After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:"
Acts,15,17,"That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things."
Acts,15,18,Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.
Acts,15,19,"Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:"
Acts,15,20,"But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood."
Acts,15,21,"For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day."
Acts,15,22,"Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brethren:"
Acts,15,23,And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.
Acts,15,24,"Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:"
Acts,15,25,"It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,"
Acts,15,26,Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Acts,15,27,"We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth."
Acts,15,28,"For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;"
Acts,15,29,"That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well."
Acts,15,30,"So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:"
Acts,15,31,"Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation."
Acts,15,32,"And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them."
Acts,15,33,"And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles."
Acts,15,34,Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.
Acts,15,35,"Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also."
Acts,15,36,"And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the LORD, and see how they do."
Acts,15,37,"And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark."
Acts,15,38,"But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work."
Acts,15,39,"And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;"
Acts,15,40,"And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God."
Acts,15,41,"And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches."
Acts,16,1,"Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:"
Acts,16,2,Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.
Acts,16,3,Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.
Acts,16,4,"And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem."
Acts,16,5,"And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily."
Acts,16,6,"Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,"
Acts,16,7,"After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not."
Acts,16,8,And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.
Acts,16,9,"And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us."
Acts,16,10,"And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them."
Acts,16,11,"Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;"
Acts,16,12,"And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days."
Acts,16,13,"And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither."
Acts,16,14,"And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul."
Acts,16,15,"And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us."
Acts,16,16,"And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:"
Acts,16,17,"The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation."
Acts,16,18,"And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour."
Acts,16,19,"And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,"
Acts,16,20,"And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,"
Acts,16,21,"And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans."
Acts,16,22,"And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them."
Acts,16,23,"And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:"
Acts,16,24,"Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks."
Acts,16,25,"And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them."
Acts,16,26,"And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed."
Acts,16,27,"And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled."
Acts,16,28,"But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here."
Acts,16,29,"Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,"
Acts,16,30,"And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
Acts,16,31,"And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house."
Acts,16,32,"And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house."
Acts,16,33,"And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway."
Acts,16,34,"And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house."
Acts,16,35,"And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go."
Acts,16,36,"And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace."
Acts,16,37,"But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out."
Acts,16,38,"And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans."
Acts,16,39,"And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city."
Acts,16,40,"And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed."
Acts,17,1,"Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:"
Acts,17,2,"And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,"
Acts,17,3,"Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ."
Acts,17,4,"And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few."
Acts,17,5,"But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people."
Acts,17,6,"And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;"
Acts,17,7,"Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus."
Acts,17,8,"And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things."
Acts,17,9,"And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go."
Acts,17,10,And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.
Acts,17,11,"These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so."
Acts,17,12,"Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few."
Acts,17,13,"But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people."
Acts,17,14,And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.
Acts,17,15,"And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed."
Acts,17,16,"Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry."
Acts,17,17,"Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him."
Acts,17,18,"Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection."
Acts,17,19,"And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?"
Acts,17,20,For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.
Acts,17,21,"(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)"
Acts,17,22,"Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious."
Acts,17,23,"For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you."
Acts,17,24,"God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;"
Acts,17,25,"Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;"
Acts,17,26,"And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;"
Acts,17,27,"That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:"
Acts,17,28,"For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring."
Acts,17,29,"Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device."
Acts,17,30,And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:
Acts,17,31,"Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead."
Acts,17,32,"And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter."
Acts,17,33,So Paul departed from among them.
Acts,17,34,"Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them."
Acts,18,1,"After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;"
Acts,18,2,"And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them."
Acts,18,3,"And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers."
Acts,18,4,"And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks."
Acts,18,5,"And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ."
Acts,18,6,"And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean; from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles."
Acts,18,7,"And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue."
Acts,18,8,"And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized."
Acts,18,9,"Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:"
Acts,18,10,"For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city."
Acts,18,11,"And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them."
Acts,18,12,"And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,"
Acts,18,13,"Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law."
Acts,18,14,"And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:"
Acts,18,15,"But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters."
Acts,18,16,And he drave them from the judgment seat.
Acts,18,17,"Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things."
Acts,18,18,"And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow."
Acts,18,19,"And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews."
Acts,18,20,"When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;"
Acts,18,21,"But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus."
Acts,18,22,"And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch."
Acts,18,23,"And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples."
Acts,18,24,"And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus."
Acts,18,25,"This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John."
Acts,18,26,"And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly."
Acts,18,27,"And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:"
Acts,18,28,"For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publicly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ."
Acts,19,1,"And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,"
Acts,19,2,"He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost."
Acts,19,3,"And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism."
Acts,19,4,"Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus."
Acts,19,5,"When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus."
Acts,19,6,"And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied."
Acts,19,7,And all the men were about twelve.
Acts,19,8,"And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God."
Acts,19,9,"But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus."
Acts,19,10,"And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks."
Acts,19,11,And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:
Acts,19,12,"So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them."
Acts,19,13,"Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth."
Acts,19,14,"And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so."
Acts,19,15,"And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?"
Acts,19,16,"And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded."
Acts,19,17,"And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified."
Acts,19,18,"And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds."
Acts,19,19,"Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver."
Acts,19,20,So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.
Acts,19,21,"After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome."
Acts,19,22,"So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season."
Acts,19,23,And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.
Acts,19,24,"For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;"
Acts,19,25,"Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth."
Acts,19,26,"Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:"
Acts,19,27,"So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth."
Acts,19,28,"And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians."
Acts,19,29,"And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre."
Acts,19,30,"And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not."
Acts,19,31,"And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre."
Acts,19,32,"Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused: and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together."
Acts,19,33,"And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people."
Acts,19,34,"But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians."
Acts,19,35,"And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?"
Acts,19,36,"Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly."
Acts,19,37,"For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess."
Acts,19,38,"Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another."
Acts,19,39,"But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly."
Acts,19,40,"For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse."
Acts,19,41,"And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly."
Acts,20,1,"And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia."
Acts,20,2,"And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,"
Acts,20,3,"And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia."
Acts,20,4,"And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus."
Acts,20,5,These going before tarried for us at Troas.
Acts,20,6,"And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days."
Acts,20,7,"And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight."
Acts,20,8,"And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together."
Acts,20,9,"And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead."
Acts,20,10,"And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him."
Acts,20,11,"When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed."
Acts,20,12,"And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted."
Acts,20,13,"And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot."
Acts,20,14,"And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene."
Acts,20,15,"And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus."
Acts,20,16,"For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost."
Acts,20,17,"And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church."

Acts,20,25,"And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more."

Acts,20,28,"Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood."

Acts,20,30,"Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them."
Acts,20,31,"Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears."

Acts,20,36,"And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all."
Acts,20,37,"And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,"
Acts,20,38,"Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship."
Acts,21,1,"And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:"
Acts,21,2,"And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth."
Acts,21,3,"Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden."
Acts,21,4,"And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem."
Acts,21,5,"And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed."
Acts,21,6,"And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again."
Acts,21,7,"And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day."
Acts,21,8,"And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him."

Acts,21,10,"And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus."
Acts,21,11,"And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles."
Acts,21,12,"And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem."

Acts,21,18,And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.
Acts,21,19,"And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry."
Acts,21,20,"And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:"
Acts,21,21,"And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs."
Acts,21,22,What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.
Acts,21,23,Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;
Acts,21,24,"Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law."
Acts,21,25,"As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication."
Acts,21,26,"Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them."
Acts,21,27,"And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,"
Acts,21,28,"Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place."
Acts,21,29,"(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)"
Acts,21,30,"And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut."
Acts,21,31,"And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar."
Acts,21,32,"Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul."
Acts,21,33,"Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done."
Acts,21,34,"And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle."
Acts,21,35,"And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people."
Acts,21,36,"For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him."
Acts,21,37,"And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?"
Acts,21,38,"Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?"
Acts,21,39,"But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people."
Acts,21,40,"And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,"
Acts,22,1,"Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto you."
Acts,22,2,"(And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)"
Acts,22,3,"I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day."
Acts,22,4,"And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women."
Acts,22,5,"As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished."
Acts,22,6,"And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me."
Acts,22,7,"And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"
Acts,22,8,"And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest."
Acts,22,9,"And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me."
Acts,22,10,"And I said, What shall I do, LORD? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do."
Acts,22,11,"And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus."
Acts,22,12,"And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,"
Acts,22,13,"Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him."
Acts,22,14,"And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth."
Acts,22,15,For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.
Acts,22,16,"And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord."
Acts,22,17,"And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;"
Acts,22,18,"And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me."
Acts,22,19,"And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:"
Acts,22,20,"And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him."
Acts,22,21,"And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles."
Acts,22,22,"And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live."
Acts,22,23,"And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,"
Acts,22,24,"The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him."
Acts,22,25,"And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?"
Acts,22,26,"When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman."
Acts,22,27,"Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea."
Acts,22,28,"And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born."
Acts,22,29,"Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him."
Acts,22,30,"On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them."
Acts,23,1,"And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day."
Acts,23,2,And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.
Acts,23,3,"Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?"
Acts,23,4,"And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?"
Acts,23,5,"Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people."
Acts,23,6,"But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question."
Acts,23,7,"And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided."
Acts,23,8,"For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both."
Acts,23,9,"And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God."
Acts,23,10,"And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle."
Acts,23,11,"And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome."
Acts,23,12,"And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul."
Acts,23,13,And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.
Acts,23,14,"And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul."
Acts,23,15,"Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him."
Acts,23,16,"And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul."
Acts,23,17,"Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him."
Acts,23,18,"So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee."
Acts,23,19,"Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?"
Acts,23,20,"And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly."
Acts,23,21,"But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee."
Acts,23,22,"So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me."
Acts,23,23,"And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;"
Acts,23,24,"And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor."
Acts,23,25,And he wrote a letter after this manner:
Acts,23,26,Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting.
Acts,23,27,"This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman."
Acts,23,28,"And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:"
Acts,23,29,"Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds."
Acts,23,30,"And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell."
Acts,23,31,"Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris."
Acts,23,32,"On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:"
Acts,23,33,"Who, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him."
Acts,23,34,"And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;"
Acts,23,35,"I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall."
Acts,24,1,"And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul."
Acts,24,2,"And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,"
Acts,24,3,"We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness."
Acts,24,4,"Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words."
Acts,24,5,"For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:"
Acts,24,6,"Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law."
Acts,24,7,"But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,"
Acts,24,8,"Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him."
Acts,24,9,"And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so."
Acts,24,10,"Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:"
Acts,24,11,"Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship."
Acts,24,12,"And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:"
Acts,24,13,Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.
Acts,24,14,"But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:"
Acts,24,15,"And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust."
Acts,24,16,"And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offence toward God, and toward men."
Acts,24,17,"Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings."
Acts,24,18,"Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult."
Acts,24,19,"Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me."
Acts,24,20,"Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,"
Acts,24,21,"Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day."
Acts,24,22,"And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter."
Acts,24,23,"And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him."
Acts,24,24,"And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ."
Acts,24,25,"And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee."
Acts,24,26,"He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him."
Acts,24,27,"But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound."
Acts,25,1,"Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem."
Acts,25,2,"Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,"
Acts,25,3,"And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him."
Acts,25,4,"But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither."
Acts,25,5,"Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him."
Acts,25,6,"And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought."
Acts,25,7,"And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove."
Acts,25,8,"While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all."
Acts,25,9,"But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?"
Acts,25,10,"Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest."
Acts,25,11,"For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar."
Acts,25,12,"Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go."
Acts,25,13,And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.
Acts,25,14,"And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:"
Acts,25,15,"About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him."
Acts,25,16,"To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him."
Acts,25,17,"Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth."
Acts,25,18,"Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:"
Acts,25,19,"But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive."
Acts,25,20,"And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters."
Acts,25,21,"But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar."
Acts,25,22,"Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him."
Acts,25,23,"And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth."
Acts,25,24,"And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer."
Acts,25,25,"But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him."
Acts,25,26,"Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write."
Acts,25,27,"For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him."
Acts,26,1,"Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:"
Acts,26,2,"I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:"
Acts,26,3,Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.
Acts,26,4,"My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;"
Acts,26,5,"Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee."
Acts,26,6,"And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God, unto our fathers:"
Acts,26,7,"Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews."
Acts,26,8,"Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?"
Acts,26,9,"I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth."
Acts,26,10,"Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them."
Acts,26,11,"And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities."
Acts,26,12,"Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,"
Acts,26,13,"At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me."
Acts,26,14,"And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks."
Acts,26,15,"And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest."
Acts,26,16,"But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;"
Acts,26,17,"Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,"
Acts,26,18,"To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me."
Acts,26,19,"Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:"
Acts,26,20,"But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance."
Acts,26,21,"For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me."
Acts,26,22,"Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:"
Acts,26,23,"That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles."
Acts,26,24,"And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad."
Acts,26,25,"But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness."
Acts,26,26,"For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner."
Acts,26,27,"King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest."
Acts,26,28,"Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian."
Acts,26,29,"And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds."
Acts,26,30,"And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:"
Acts,26,31,"And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds."
Acts,26,32,"Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar."
Acts,27,1,"And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band."
Acts,27,2,"And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us."
Acts,27,3,"And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself."
Acts,27,4,"And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary."
Acts,27,5,"And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia."
Acts,27,6,And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.
Acts,27,7,"And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;"
Acts,27,8,"And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea."
Acts,27,9,"Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,"
Acts,27,10,"And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives."
Acts,27,11,"Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul."
Acts,27,12,"And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west."
Acts,27,13,"And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete."
Acts,27,14,"But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon."
Acts,27,15,"And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive."
Acts,27,16,"And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:"
Acts,27,17,"Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven."
Acts,27,18,"And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;"
Acts,27,19,And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.
Acts,27,20,"And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away."
Acts,27,21,"But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss."
Acts,27,22,"And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship."
Acts,27,23,"For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,"
Acts,27,24,"Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee."
Acts,27,25,"Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me."
Acts,27,26,Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.
Acts,27,27,"But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;"
Acts,27,28,"And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms."
Acts,27,29,"Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day."
Acts,27,30,"And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,"
Acts,27,31,"Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved."
Acts,27,32,"Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off."
Acts,27,33,"And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing."
Acts,27,34,Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.
Acts,27,35,"And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat."
Acts,27,36,"Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat."
Acts,27,37,And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.
Acts,27,38,"And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea."
Acts,27,39,"And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship."
Acts,27,40,"And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore."
Acts,27,41,"And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves."
Acts,27,42,"And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape."
Acts,27,43,"But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:"
Acts,27,44,"And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land."
Acts,28,1,"And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita."
Acts,28,2,"And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold."
Acts,28,3,"And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand."
Acts,28,4,"And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live."
Acts,28,5,"And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm."
Acts,28,6,"Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god."
Acts,28,7,"In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously."
Acts,28,8,"And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him."
Acts,28,9,"So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:"
Acts,28,10,"Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary."
Acts,28,11,"And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux."
Acts,28,12,"And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days."
Acts,28,13,"And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:"
Acts,28,14,"Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome."
Acts,28,15,"And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage."
Acts,28,16,"And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him."
Acts,28,17,"And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans."
Acts,28,18,"Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me."
Acts,28,19,"But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of."
Acts,28,20,"For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain."
Acts,28,21,"And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee."
Acts,28,22,"But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against."
Acts,28,23,"And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening."
Acts,28,24,"And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not."
Acts,28,25,"And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,"
Acts,28,26,"Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:"
Acts,28,27,"For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them."
Acts,28,28,"Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it."
Acts,28,29,"And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves."
Acts,28,30,"And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,"
Acts,28,31,"Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him."
Romans,1,1,"Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, "
Romans,1,2,"(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,) "
Romans,1,3,"Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; "
Romans,1,4,"And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead: "
Romans,1,5,"By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name: "
Romans,1,6,Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ: 
Romans,1,7,"To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. "
Romans,1,8,"First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. "
Romans,1,9,"For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers; "
Romans,1,10,"Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you. "
Romans,1,11,"For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established; "
Romans,1,12,"That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me. "
Romans,1,13,"Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles. "
Romans,1,14,"I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise. "
Romans,1,15,"So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also. "
Romans,1,16,"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. "
Romans,1,17,"For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. "
Romans,1,18,"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; "
Romans,1,19,Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. 
Romans,1,20,"For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: "
Romans,1,21,"Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. "
Romans,1,22,"Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, "
Romans,1,23,"And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. "
Romans,1,24,"Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: "
Romans,1,25,"Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. "
Romans,1,26,For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: 
Romans,1,27,"And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. "
Romans,1,28,"And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; "
Romans,1,29,"Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, "
Romans,1,30,"Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, "
Romans,1,31,"Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: "
Romans,1,32,"Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them."
Romans,2,1,"Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things. "
Romans,2,2,But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things. 
Romans,2,3,"And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God? "
Romans,2,4,Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? 
Romans,2,5,But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; 
Romans,2,6,Who will render to every man according to his deeds: 
Romans,2,7,"To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life: "
Romans,2,8,"But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, "
Romans,2,9,"Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile; "
Romans,2,10,"But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile: "
Romans,2,11,For there is no respect of persons with God. 
Romans,2,12,For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law; 
Romans,2,13,"(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified. "
Romans,2,14,"For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: "
Romans,2,15,"Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;) "
Romans,2,16,In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel. 
Romans,2,17,"Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God, "
Romans,2,18,"And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law; "
Romans,2,19,"And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness, "
Romans,2,20,"An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law. "
Romans,2,21,"Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal? "
Romans,2,22,"Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege? "
Romans,2,23,"Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God? "
Romans,2,24,"For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written. "
Romans,2,25,"For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision. "
Romans,2,26,"Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? "
Romans,2,27,"And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law? "
Romans,2,28,"For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: "
Romans,2,29,"But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God."
Romans,3,1,What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision? 
Romans,3,2,"Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God. "
Romans,3,3,For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? 
Romans,3,4,"God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged. "
Romans,3,5,"But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man) "
Romans,3,6,God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world? 
Romans,3,7,For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner? 
Romans,3,8,"And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just. "
Romans,3,9,"What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin; "
Romans,3,10,"As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: "
Romans,3,11,"There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. "
Romans,3,12,"They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. "
Romans,3,13,Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: 
Romans,3,14,Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: 
Romans,3,15,Their feet are swift to shed blood: 
Romans,3,16,Destruction and misery are in their ways: 
Romans,3,17,And the way of peace have they not known: 
Romans,3,18,There is no fear of God before their eyes. 
Romans,3,19,"Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. "
Romans,3,20,Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. 
Romans,3,21,"But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; "
Romans,3,22,Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: 
Romans,3,23,"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; "
Romans,3,24,Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: 
Romans,3,25,"Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; "
Romans,3,26,"To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. "
Romans,3,27,Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. 
Romans,3,28,Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. 
Romans,3,29,"Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: "
Romans,3,30,"Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. "
Romans,3,31,"Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law."
Romans,4,1,"What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found? "
Romans,4,2,"For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God. "
Romans,4,3,"For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness. "
Romans,4,4,"Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. "
Romans,4,5,"But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. "
Romans,4,6,"Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, "
Romans,4,7,"Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. "
Romans,4,8,Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. 
Romans,4,9,"Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness. "
Romans,4,10,"How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. "
Romans,4,11,"And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also: "
Romans,4,12,"And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised. "
Romans,4,13,"For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. "
Romans,4,14,"For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect: "
Romans,4,15,"Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression. "
Romans,4,16,"Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all, "
Romans,4,17,"(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were. "
Romans,4,18,"Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be. "
Romans,4,19,"And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb: "
Romans,4,20,"He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; "
Romans,4,21,"And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform. "
Romans,4,22,And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness. 
Romans,4,23,"Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; "
Romans,4,24,"But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; "
Romans,4,25,"Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification."
Romans,5,1,"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: "
Romans,5,2,"By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. "
Romans,5,3,"And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; "
Romans,5,4,"And patience, experience; and experience, hope: "
Romans,5,5,And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. 
Romans,5,6,"For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. "
Romans,5,7,For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. 
Romans,5,8,"But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. "
Romans,5,9,"Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. "
Romans,5,10,"For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. "
Romans,5,11,"And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement. "
Romans,5,12,"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: "
Romans,5,13,(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law. 
Romans,5,14,"Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come. "
Romans,5,15,"But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. "
Romans,5,16,"And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification. "
Romans,5,17,"For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.) "
Romans,5,18,Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. 
Romans,5,19,"For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. "
Romans,5,20,"Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: "
Romans,5,21,"That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord."
Romans,6,1,"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? "
Romans,6,2,"God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? "
Romans,6,3,"Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? "
Romans,6,4,"Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. "
Romans,6,5,"For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: "
Romans,6,6,"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. "
Romans,6,7,For he that is dead is freed from sin. 
Romans,6,8,"Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him: "
Romans,6,9,Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. 
Romans,6,10,"For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. "
Romans,6,11,"Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. "
Romans,6,12,"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. "
Romans,6,13,"Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. "
Romans,6,14,"For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. "
Romans,6,15,"What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. "
Romans,6,16,"Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? "
Romans,6,17,"But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. "
Romans,6,18,"Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness. "
Romans,6,19,I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness. 
Romans,6,20,"For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. "
Romans,6,21,What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. 
Romans,6,22,"But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. "
Romans,6,23,For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Romans,7,1,"Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth? "
Romans,7,2,"For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. "
Romans,7,3,"So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man. "
Romans,7,4,"Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. "
Romans,7,5,"For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. "
Romans,7,6,"But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter. "
Romans,7,7,"What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. "
Romans,7,8,"But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. "
Romans,7,9,"For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. "
Romans,7,10,"And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death. "
Romans,7,11,"For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me. "
Romans,7,12,"Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. "
Romans,7,13,"Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful. "
Romans,7,14,"For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin. "
Romans,7,15,"For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I. "
Romans,7,16,"If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good. "
Romans,7,17,"Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. "
Romans,7,18,"For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. "
Romans,7,19,"For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do. "
Romans,7,20,"Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. "
Romans,7,21,"I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me. "
Romans,7,22,For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: 
Romans,7,23,"But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. "
Romans,7,24,O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? 
Romans,7,25,I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.
Romans,8,1,"There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. "
Romans,8,2,For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. 
Romans,8,3,"For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: "
Romans,8,4,"That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. "
Romans,8,5,For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. 
Romans,8,6,For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. 
Romans,8,7,"Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. "
Romans,8,8,So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. 
Romans,8,9,"But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. "
Romans,8,10,"And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. "
Romans,8,11,"But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. "
Romans,8,12,"Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh. "
Romans,8,13,"For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. "
Romans,8,14,"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. "
Romans,8,15,"For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. "
Romans,8,16,"The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: "
Romans,8,17,"And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. "
Romans,8,18,For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. 
Romans,8,19,For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. 
Romans,8,20,"For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope, "
Romans,8,21,Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. 
Romans,8,22,For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. 
Romans,8,23,"And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. "
Romans,8,24,"For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? "
Romans,8,25,"But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it. "
Romans,8,26,Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. 
Romans,8,27,"And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God. "
Romans,8,28,"And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. "
Romans,8,29,"For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. "
Romans,8,30,"Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified. "
Romans,8,31,"What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? "
Romans,8,32,"He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? "
Romans,8,33,Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. 
Romans,8,34,"Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. "
Romans,8,35,"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? "
Romans,8,36,"As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. "
Romans,8,37,"Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. "
Romans,8,38,"For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, "
Romans,8,39,"Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
Romans,9,1,"I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost, "
Romans,9,2,That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. 
Romans,9,3,"For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh: "
Romans,9,4,"Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises; "
Romans,9,5,"Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen. "
Romans,9,6,"Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel: "
Romans,9,7,"Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called. "
Romans,9,8,"That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed. "
Romans,9,9,"For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son. "
Romans,9,10,"And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac; "
Romans,9,11,"(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;) "
Romans,9,12,"It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. "
Romans,9,13,"As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. "
Romans,9,14,What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid. 
Romans,9,15,"For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. "
Romans,9,16,"So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. "
Romans,9,17,"For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth. "
Romans,9,18,"Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth. "
Romans,9,19,"Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will? "
Romans,9,20,"Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? "
Romans,9,21,"Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour? "
Romans,9,22,"What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: "
Romans,9,23,"And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory, "
Romans,9,24,"Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles? "
Romans,9,25,"As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved. "
Romans,9,26,"And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God. "
Romans,9,27,"Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved: "
Romans,9,28,"For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth. "
Romans,9,29,"And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha. "
Romans,9,30,"What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith. "
Romans,9,31,"But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness. "
Romans,9,32,"Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone; "
Romans,9,33,"As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed."
Romans,10,1,"Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved. "
Romans,10,2,"For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. "
Romans,10,3,"For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. "
Romans,10,4,For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth. 
Romans,10,5,"For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them. "
Romans,10,6,"But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:) "
Romans,10,7,"Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.) "
Romans,10,8,"But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; "
Romans,10,9,"That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. "
Romans,10,10,For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 
Romans,10,11,"For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. "
Romans,10,12,For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. 
Romans,10,13,For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. 
Romans,10,14,How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? 
Romans,10,15,"And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! "
Romans,10,16,"But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report? "
Romans,10,17,"So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. "
Romans,10,18,"But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world. "
Romans,10,19,"But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you. "
Romans,10,20,"But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me. "
Romans,10,21,"But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people."
Romans,11,1,"I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. "
Romans,11,2,"God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying, "
Romans,11,3,"Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life. "
Romans,11,4,"But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal. "
Romans,11,5,Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace. 
Romans,11,6,"And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work. "
Romans,11,7,"What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded. "
Romans,11,8,"(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day. "
Romans,11,9,"And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them: "
Romans,11,10,"Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway. "
Romans,11,11,"I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy. "
Romans,11,12,"Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness? "
Romans,11,13,"For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office: "
Romans,11,14,"If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them. "
Romans,11,15,"For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead? "
Romans,11,16,"For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches. "
Romans,11,17,"And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert grafted in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree; "
Romans,11,18,"Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee. "
Romans,11,19,"Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in. "
Romans,11,20,"Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear: "
Romans,11,21,"For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee. "
Romans,11,22,"Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. "
Romans,11,23," And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again. "
Romans,11,24,"For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree? "
Romans,11,25,"For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in. "
Romans,11,26,"And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: "
Romans,11,27,"For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins. "
Romans,11,28,"As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes. "
Romans,11,29,For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. 
Romans,11,30,"For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief: "
Romans,11,31,"Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy. "
Romans,11,32,"For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all. "
Romans,11,33,"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out! "
Romans,11,34,For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor? 
Romans,11,35,"Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? "
Romans,11,36,"For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen."
Romans,12,1,"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. "
Romans,12,2,"And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. "
Romans,12,3,"For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. "
Romans,12,4,"For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office: "
Romans,12,5,"So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another. "
Romans,12,6,"Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; "
Romans,12,7,"Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching; "
Romans,12,8,"Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness. "
Romans,12,9,Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good. 
Romans,12,10,Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another; 
Romans,12,11,Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; 
Romans,12,12,Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; 
Romans,12,13,Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality. 
Romans,12,14,"Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not. "
Romans,12,15,"Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep. "
Romans,12,16,"Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits. "
Romans,12,17,Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. 
Romans,12,18,"If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. "
Romans,12,19,"Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. "
Romans,12,20,"Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. "
Romans,12,21,"Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."
Romans,13,1,Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. 
Romans,13,2,"Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation. "
Romans,13,3,"For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same: "
Romans,13,4,"For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil. "
Romans,13,5,"Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake. "
Romans,13,6,"For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing. "
Romans,13,7,Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour. 
Romans,13,8,"Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. "
Romans,13,9,"For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. "
Romans,13,10,Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law. 
Romans,13,11,"And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. "
Romans,13,12,"The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. "
Romans,13,13,"Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying. "
Romans,13,14,"But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof."
Romans,14,1,"Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations. "
Romans,14,2,"For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs. "
Romans,14,3,Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him. 
Romans,14,4,"Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand. "
Romans,14,5,One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. 
Romans,14,6,"He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks. "
Romans,14,7,"For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself. "
Romans,14,8,"For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's. "
Romans,14,9,"For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living. "
Romans,14,10,But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. 
Romans,14,11,"For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. "
Romans,14,12,So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God. 
Romans,14,13,"Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way. "
Romans,14,14,"I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean. "
Romans,14,15,"But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died. "
Romans,14,16,Let not then your good be evil spoken of: 
Romans,14,17,"For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. "
Romans,14,18,"For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men. "
Romans,14,19,"Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another. "
Romans,14,20,For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence. 
Romans,14,21,"It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak. "
Romans,14,22,Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. 
Romans,14,23,"And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin."
Romans,15,1,"We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. "
Romans,15,2,Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification. 
Romans,15,3,"For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me. "
Romans,15,4,"For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope. "
Romans,15,5,Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus: 
Romans,15,6,"That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. "
Romans,15,7,"Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God. "
Romans,15,8,"Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers: "
Romans,15,9,"And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name. "
Romans,15,10,"And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people. "
Romans,15,11,"And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people. "
Romans,15,12,"And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust. "
Romans,15,13,"Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost. "
Romans,15,14,"And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another. "
Romans,15,15,"Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God, "
Romans,15,16,"That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost. "
Romans,15,17,I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God. 
Romans,15,18,"For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed, "
Romans,15,19,"Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ. "
Romans,15,20,"Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation: "
Romans,15,21,"But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand. "
Romans,15,22,For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you. 
Romans,15,23,"But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you; "
Romans,15,24,"Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company. "
Romans,15,25,But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints. 
Romans,15,26,For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem. 
Romans,15,27,"It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things. "
Romans,15,28,"When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain. "
Romans,15,29,"And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ. "
Romans,15,30,"Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me; "
Romans,15,31,That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints; 
Romans,15,32,"That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed. "
Romans,15,33,Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
Romans,16,1,"I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea: "
Romans,16,2,"That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also. "
Romans,16,3,Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus: 
Romans,16,4,"Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles. "
Romans,16,5,"Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my well-beloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ. "
Romans,16,6,"Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us. "
Romans,16,7,"Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me. "
Romans,16,8,Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord. 
Romans,16,9,"Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved. "
Romans,16,10,Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of Aristobulus' household. 
Romans,16,11,"Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord. "
Romans,16,12,"Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord. "
Romans,16,13,"Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine. "
Romans,16,14,"Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them. "
Romans,16,15,"Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with them. "
Romans,16,16,Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you. 
Romans,16,17,"Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them. "
Romans,16,18,"For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple. "
Romans,16,19,"For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil. "
Romans,16,20,And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. 
Romans,16,21,"Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you. "
Romans,16,22,"I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord. "
Romans,16,23,"Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother. "
Romans,16,24,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. 
Romans,16,25,"Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began, "
Romans,16,26,"But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith: "
Romans,16,27,"To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen."
1 Corinthians,1,1,"Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,"
1 Corinthians,1,2,"Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both their's and our's:"
1 Corinthians,1,3,"Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ."
1 Corinthians,1,4,"I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;"
1 Corinthians,1,5,"That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;"
1 Corinthians,1,6,Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:
1 Corinthians,1,7,So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:
1 Corinthians,1,8,"Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ."
1 Corinthians,1,9,"God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord."
1 Corinthians,1,10,"Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment."
1 Corinthians,1,11,"For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you."
1 Corinthians,1,12,"Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ."
1 Corinthians,1,13,Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?
1 Corinthians,1,14,"I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;"
1 Corinthians,1,15,Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.
1 Corinthians,1,16,"And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other."
1 Corinthians,1,17,"For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect."
1 Corinthians,1,18,For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.
1 Corinthians,1,19,"For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent."
1 Corinthians,1,20,Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
1 Corinthians,1,21,"For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe."
1 Corinthians,1,22,"For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:"
1 Corinthians,1,23,"But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;"
1 Corinthians,1,24,"But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God."
1 Corinthians,1,25,Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
1 Corinthians,1,26,"For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:"
1 Corinthians,1,27,But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;
1 Corinthians,1,28,"And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:"
1 Corinthians,1,29,That no flesh should glory in his presence.
1 Corinthians,1,30,"But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:"
1 Corinthians,1,31,"That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord."
1 Corinthians,2,1,"And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God."
1 Corinthians,2,2,"For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified."
1 Corinthians,2,3,"And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling."
1 Corinthians,2,4,"And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:"
1 Corinthians,2,5,"That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God."
1 Corinthians,2,6,"Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:"
1 Corinthians,2,7,"But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:"
1 Corinthians,2,8,"Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."
1 Corinthians,2,9,"But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him."
1 Corinthians,2,10,"But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God."
1 Corinthians,2,11,"For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God."
1 Corinthians,2,12,"Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God."
1 Corinthians,2,13,"Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual."
1 Corinthians,2,14,"But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned."
1 Corinthians,2,15,"But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man."
1 Corinthians,2,16,"For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? but we have the mind of Christ."
1 Corinthians,3,1,"And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ."
1 Corinthians,3,2,"I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able."
1 Corinthians,3,3,"For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?"
1 Corinthians,3,4,"For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?"
1 Corinthians,3,5,"Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?"
1 Corinthians,3,6,"I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase."
1 Corinthians,3,7,"So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase."
1 Corinthians,3,8,Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.
1 Corinthians,3,9,"For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building."
1 Corinthians,3,10,"According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon."
1 Corinthians,3,11,"For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ."
1 Corinthians,3,12,"Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;"
1 Corinthians,3,13,"Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is."
1 Corinthians,3,14,"If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward."
1 Corinthians,3,15,"If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire."
1 Corinthians,3,16,"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?"
1 Corinthians,3,17,"If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are."
1 Corinthians,3,18,"Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise."
1 Corinthians,3,19,"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness."
1 Corinthians,3,20,"And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain."
1 Corinthians,3,21,Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are your's;
1 Corinthians,3,22,"Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are your's;"
1 Corinthians,3,23,And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.
1 Corinthians,4,1,"Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God."
1 Corinthians,4,2,"Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful."
1 Corinthians,4,3,"But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self."
1 Corinthians,4,4,For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.
1 Corinthians,4,5,"Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God."
1 Corinthians,4,6,"And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another."
1 Corinthians,4,7,"For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?"
1 Corinthians,4,8,"Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you."
1 Corinthians,4,9,"For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men."
1 Corinthians,4,10,"We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised."
1 Corinthians,4,11,"Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;"
1 Corinthians,4,12,"And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:"
1 Corinthians,4,13,"Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day."
1 Corinthians,4,14,"I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you."
1 Corinthians,4,15,"For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel."
1 Corinthians,4,16,"Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me."
1 Corinthians,4,17,"For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church."
1 Corinthians,4,18,"Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you."
1 Corinthians,4,19,"But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power."
1 Corinthians,4,20,"For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power."
1 Corinthians,4,21,"What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?"
1 Corinthians,5,1,"It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife."
1 Corinthians,5,2,"And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you."
1 Corinthians,5,3,"For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,"
1 Corinthians,5,4,"In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
1 Corinthians,5,5,"To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."
1 Corinthians,5,6,Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?
1 Corinthians,5,7,"Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:"
1 Corinthians,5,8,"Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."
1 Corinthians,5,9,I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:
1 Corinthians,5,10,"Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world."
1 Corinthians,5,11,"But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolator, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat."
1 Corinthians,5,12,For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?
1 Corinthians,5,13,But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.
1 Corinthians,6,1,"Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?"
1 Corinthians,6,2,"Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?"
1 Corinthians,6,3,Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?
1 Corinthians,6,4,"If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church."
1 Corinthians,6,5,"I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?"
1 Corinthians,6,6,"But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers."
1 Corinthians,6,7,"Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?"
1 Corinthians,6,8,"Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren."
1 Corinthians,6,9,"Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,"
1 Corinthians,6,10,"Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God."
1 Corinthians,6,11,"And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God."
1 Corinthians,6,12,"All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any."
1 Corinthians,6,13,"Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body."
1 Corinthians,6,14,"And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power."
1 Corinthians,6,15,"Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid."
1 Corinthians,6,16,"What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh."
1 Corinthians,6,17,But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
1 Corinthians,6,18,Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.
1 Corinthians,6,19,"What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?"
1 Corinthians,6,20,"For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's."
1 Corinthians,7,1,Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.
1 Corinthians,7,2,"Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband."
1 Corinthians,7,3,Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.
1 Corinthians,7,4,"The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife."
1 Corinthians,7,5,"Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency."
1 Corinthians,7,6,"But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment."
1 Corinthians,7,7,"For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that."
1 Corinthians,7,8,"I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, it is good for them if they abide even as I."
1 Corinthians,7,9,"But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn."
1 Corinthians,7,10,"And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:"
1 Corinthians,7,11,"But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife."
1 Corinthians,7,12,"But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away."
1 Corinthians,7,13,"And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him."
1 Corinthians,7,14,"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy."
1 Corinthians,7,15,"But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace."
1 Corinthians,7,16,"For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?"
1 Corinthians,7,17,"But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches."
1 Corinthians,7,18,Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.
1 Corinthians,7,19,"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God."
1 Corinthians,7,20,Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.
1 Corinthians,7,21,"Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather."
1 Corinthians,7,22,"For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant."
1 Corinthians,7,23,Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.
1 Corinthians,7,24,"Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God."
1 Corinthians,7,25,"Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful."
1 Corinthians,7,26,"I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be."
1 Corinthians,7,27,Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.
1 Corinthians,7,28,"But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you."
1 Corinthians,7,29,"But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;"
1 Corinthians,7,30,"And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;"
1 Corinthians,7,31,"And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away."
1 Corinthians,7,32,"But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:"
1 Corinthians,7,33,"But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife."
1 Corinthians,7,34,"There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband."
1 Corinthians,7,35,"And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction."
1 Corinthians,7,36,"But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry."
1 Corinthians,7,37,"Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well."
1 Corinthians,7,38,So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.
1 Corinthians,7,39,"The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord."
1 Corinthians,7,40,"But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God."
1 Corinthians,8,1,"Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth."
1 Corinthians,8,2,"And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know."
1 Corinthians,8,3,"But if any man love God, the same is known of him."
1 Corinthians,8,4,"As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one."
1 Corinthians,8,5,"For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)"
1 Corinthians,8,6,"But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him."
1 Corinthians,8,7,Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.
1 Corinthians,8,8,"But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse."
1 Corinthians,8,9,But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.
1 Corinthians,8,10,"For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;"
1 Corinthians,8,11,"And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?"
1 Corinthians,8,12,"But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ."
1 Corinthians,8,13,"Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend."
1 Corinthians,9,1,Am I am not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?
1 Corinthians,9,2,"If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord."
1 Corinthians,9,3,"Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,"
1 Corinthians,9,4,Have we not power to eat and to drink?
1 Corinthians,9,5,"Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?"
1 Corinthians,9,6,"Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?"
1 Corinthians,9,7,"Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?"
1 Corinthians,9,8,Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?
1 Corinthians,9,9,"For it is written in the law of Moses, thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?"
1 Corinthians,9,10,"Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope."
1 Corinthians,9,11,"If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?"
1 Corinthians,9,12,"If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ."
1 Corinthians,9,13,Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?
1 Corinthians,9,14,Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.
1 Corinthians,9,15,"But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void."
1 Corinthians,9,16,"For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!"
1 Corinthians,9,17,"For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me."
1 Corinthians,9,18,"What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel."
1 Corinthians,9,19,"For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more."
1 Corinthians,9,20,"And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;"
1 Corinthians,9,21,"To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law."
1 Corinthians,9,22,"To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some."
1 Corinthians,9,23,"And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you."
1 Corinthians,9,24,"Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain."
1 Corinthians,9,25,And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.
1 Corinthians,9,26,"I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:"
1 Corinthians,9,27,"But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway."
1 Corinthians,10,1,"Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;"
1 Corinthians,10,2,And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
1 Corinthians,10,3,And did all eat the same spiritual meat;
1 Corinthians,10,4,And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.
1 Corinthians,10,5,But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
1 Corinthians,10,6,"Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted."
1 Corinthians,10,7,"Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play."
1 Corinthians,10,8,"Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand."
1 Corinthians,10,9,"Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents."
1 Corinthians,10,10,"Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer."
1 Corinthians,10,11,"Now all these things happened unto them for examples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come."
1 Corinthians,10,12,Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.
1 Corinthians,10,13,"There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it."
1 Corinthians,10,14,"Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry."
1 Corinthians,10,15,I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.
1 Corinthians,10,16,"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?"
1 Corinthians,10,17,"For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread."
1 Corinthians,10,18,Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?
1 Corinthians,10,19,"What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?"
1 Corinthians,10,20,"But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils."
1 Corinthians,10,21,"Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils."
1 Corinthians,10,22,Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
1 Corinthians,10,23,"All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not."
1 Corinthians,10,24,"Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth."
1 Corinthians,10,25,"Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:"
1 Corinthians,10,26,"For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof."
1 Corinthians,10,27,"If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake."
1 Corinthians,10,28,"But if any man say unto you, this is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:"
1 Corinthians,10,29,"Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?"
1 Corinthians,10,30,"For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?"
1 Corinthians,10,31,"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God."
1 Corinthians,10,32,"Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:"
1 Corinthians,10,33,"Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved."
1 Corinthians,11,1,"Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ."
1 Corinthians,11,2,"Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you."
1 Corinthians,11,3,"But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God."
1 Corinthians,11,4,"Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head."
1 Corinthians,11,5,But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.
1 Corinthians,11,6,"For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered."
1 Corinthians,11,7,"For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man."
1 Corinthians,11,8,For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.
1 Corinthians,11,9,Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.
1 Corinthians,11,10,For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.
1 Corinthians,11,11,"Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord."
1 Corinthians,11,12,"For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God."
1 Corinthians,11,13,Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?
1 Corinthians,11,14,"Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?"
1 Corinthians,11,15,"But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering."
1 Corinthians,11,16,"But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God."
1 Corinthians,11,17,"Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse."
1 Corinthians,11,18,"For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it."
1 Corinthians,11,19,"For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you."
1 Corinthians,11,20,"When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper."
1 Corinthians,11,21,"For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken."
1 Corinthians,11,22,"What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? what shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not."
1 Corinthians,11,23,"For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:"
1 Corinthians,11,24,"And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me."
1 Corinthians,11,25,"After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, this cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me."
1 Corinthians,11,26,"For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come."
1 Corinthians,11,27,"Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord."
1 Corinthians,11,28,"But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup."
1 Corinthians,11,29,"For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body."
1 Corinthians,11,30,"For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep."
1 Corinthians,11,31,"For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged."
1 Corinthians,11,32,"But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world."
1 Corinthians,11,33,"Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another."
1 Corinthians,11,34,"And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come."
1 Corinthians,12,1,"Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant."
1 Corinthians,12,2,"Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led."
1 Corinthians,12,3,"Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost."
1 Corinthians,12,4,"Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,5,"And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord."
1 Corinthians,12,6,"And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all."
1 Corinthians,12,7,But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.
1 Corinthians,12,8,For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
1 Corinthians,12,9,To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
1 Corinthians,12,10,To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:
1 Corinthians,12,11,"But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will."
1 Corinthians,12,12,"For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ."
1 Corinthians,12,13,"For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit."
1 Corinthians,12,14,"For the body is not one member, but many."
1 Corinthians,12,15,"If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?"
1 Corinthians,12,16,"And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?"
1 Corinthians,12,17,"If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?"
1 Corinthians,12,18,"But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him."
1 Corinthians,12,19,"And if they were all one member, where were the body?"
1 Corinthians,12,20,"But now are they many members, yet but one body."
1 Corinthians,12,21,"And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you."
1 Corinthians,12,22,"Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:"
1 Corinthians,12,23,"And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness."
1 Corinthians,12,24,"For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked."
1 Corinthians,12,25,That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.
1 Corinthians,12,26,"And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it."
1 Corinthians,12,27,"Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular."
1 Corinthians,12,28,"And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues."
1 Corinthians,12,29,Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?
1 Corinthians,12,30,Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
1 Corinthians,12,31,But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.
1 Corinthians,13,1,"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal."
1 Corinthians,13,2,"And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing."
1 Corinthians,13,3,"And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing."
1 Corinthians,13,4,"Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,"
1 Corinthians,13,5,"Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;"
1 Corinthians,13,6,"Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;"
1 Corinthians,13,7,"Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things."
1 Corinthians,13,8,"Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away."
1 Corinthians,13,9,"For we know in part, and we prophesy in part."
1 Corinthians,13,10,"But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away."
1 Corinthians,13,11,"When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things."
1 Corinthians,13,12,"For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known."
1 Corinthians,13,13,"And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity."
1 Corinthians,14,1,"Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy."
1 Corinthians,14,2,"For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries."
1 Corinthians,14,3,"But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort."
1 Corinthians,14,4,He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.
1 Corinthians,14,5,"I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying."
1 Corinthians,14,6,"Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?"
1 Corinthians,14,7,"And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?"
1 Corinthians,14,8,"For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?"
1 Corinthians,14,9,"So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air."
1 Corinthians,14,10,"There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification."
1 Corinthians,14,11,"Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me."
1 Corinthians,14,12,"Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church."
1 Corinthians,14,13,Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.
1 Corinthians,14,14,"For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful."
1 Corinthians,14,15,"What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also."
1 Corinthians,14,16,"Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?"
1 Corinthians,14,17,"For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified."
1 Corinthians,14,18,"I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:"
1 Corinthians,14,19,"Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue."
1 Corinthians,14,20,"Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men."
1 Corinthians,14,21,"In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord."
1 Corinthians,14,22,"Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe."
1 Corinthians,14,23,"If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?"
1 Corinthians,14,24,"But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:"
1 Corinthians,14,25,"And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth."
1 Corinthians,14,26,"How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying."
1 Corinthians,14,27,"If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret."
1 Corinthians,14,28,"But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God."
1 Corinthians,14,29,"Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge."
1 Corinthians,14,30,"If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace."
1 Corinthians,14,31,"For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted."
1 Corinthians,14,32,And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
1 Corinthians,14,33,"For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints."
1 Corinthians,14,34,Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law.
1 Corinthians,14,35,"And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church."
1 Corinthians,14,36,What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?
1 Corinthians,14,37,"If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord."
1 Corinthians,14,38,"But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant."
1 Corinthians,14,39,"Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues."
1 Corinthians,14,40,Let all things be done decently and in order.
1 Corinthians,15,1,"Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;"
1 Corinthians,15,2,"By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain."
1 Corinthians,15,3,"For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;"
1 Corinthians,15,4,"And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:"
1 Corinthians,15,5,"And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:"
1 Corinthians,15,6,"After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep."
1 Corinthians,15,7,"After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles."
1 Corinthians,15,8,"And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time."
1 Corinthians,15,9,"For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God."
1 Corinthians,15,10,"But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me."
1 Corinthians,15,11,"Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed."
1 Corinthians,15,12,"Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?"
1 Corinthians,15,13,"But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:"
1 Corinthians,15,14,"And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain."
1 Corinthians,15,15,"Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not."
1 Corinthians,15,16,"For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:"
1 Corinthians,15,17,"And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins."
1 Corinthians,15,18,Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.
1 Corinthians,15,19,"If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable."
1 Corinthians,15,20,"But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept."
1 Corinthians,15,21,"For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead."
1 Corinthians,15,22,"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive."
1 Corinthians,15,23,But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.
1 Corinthians,15,24,"Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power."
1 Corinthians,15,25,"For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet."
1 Corinthians,15,26,The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.
1 Corinthians,15,27,"For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him."
1 Corinthians,15,28,"And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all."
1 Corinthians,15,29,"Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?"
1 Corinthians,15,30,And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?
1 Corinthians,15,31,"I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily."
1 Corinthians,15,32,"If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die."
1 Corinthians,15,33,Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.
1 Corinthians,15,34,"Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame."
1 Corinthians,15,35,"But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?"
1 Corinthians,15,36,"Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:"
1 Corinthians,15,37,"And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:"
1 Corinthians,15,38,"But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body."
1 Corinthians,15,39,"All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds."
1 Corinthians,15,40,"There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another."
1 Corinthians,15,41,"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory."
1 Corinthians,15,42,So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
1 Corinthians,15,43,It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:
1 Corinthians,15,44,"It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body."
1 Corinthians,15,45,"And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit."
1 Corinthians,15,46,"Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual."
1 Corinthians,15,47,"The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven."
1 Corinthians,15,48,"As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly."
1 Corinthians,15,49,"And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly."
1 Corinthians,15,50,"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption."
1 Corinthians,15,51,"Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,"
1 Corinthians,15,52,"In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed."
1 Corinthians,15,53,"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality."
1 Corinthians,15,54,"So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory."
1 Corinthians,15,55,"O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?"
1 Corinthians,15,56,The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.
1 Corinthians,15,57,"But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
1 Corinthians,15,58,"Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord."
1 Corinthians,16,1,"Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye."
1 Corinthians,16,2,"Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come."
1 Corinthians,16,3,"And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem."
1 Corinthians,16,4,"And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me."
1 Corinthians,16,5,"Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia."
1 Corinthians,16,6,"And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go."
1 Corinthians,16,7,"For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit."
1 Corinthians,16,8,But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.
1 Corinthians,16,9,"For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries."
1 Corinthians,16,10,"Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do."
1 Corinthians,16,11,"Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren."
1 Corinthians,16,12,"As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time."
1 Corinthians,16,13,"Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong."
1 Corinthians,16,14,Let all your things be done with charity.
1 Corinthians,16,15,"I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)"
1 Corinthians,16,16,"That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth."
1 Corinthians,16,17,I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.
1 Corinthians,16,18,For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.
1 Corinthians,16,19,"The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house."
1 Corinthians,16,20,All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.
1 Corinthians,16,21,The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.
1 Corinthians,16,22,"If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha."
1 Corinthians,16,23,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
1 Corinthians,16,24,My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
2 Corinthians,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:"
2 Corinthians,1,2,"Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ."
2 Corinthians,1,3,"Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;"
2 Corinthians,1,4,"Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God."
2 Corinthians,1,5,"For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ."
2 Corinthians,1,6,"And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation."
2 Corinthians,1,7,"And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation."
2 Corinthians,1,8,"For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:"
2 Corinthians,1,9,"But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:"
2 Corinthians,1,10,"Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;"
2 Corinthians,1,11,"Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf."
2 Corinthians,1,12,"For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward."
2 Corinthians,1,13,"For we write none other things unto you, that what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;"
2 Corinthians,1,14,"As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are our's in the day of the Lord Jesus."
2 Corinthians,1,15,"And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;"
2 Corinthians,1,16,"And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea."
2 Corinthians,1,17,"When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?"
2 Corinthians,1,18,"But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay."
2 Corinthians,1,19,"For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea."
2 Corinthians,1,20,"For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us."
2 Corinthians,1,21,"Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God;"
2 Corinthians,1,22,"Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts."
2 Corinthians,1,23,"Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth."
2 Corinthians,1,24,"Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand."
2 Corinthians,2,1,"But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness."
2 Corinthians,2,2,"For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?"
2 Corinthians,2,3,"And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all."
2 Corinthians,2,4,"For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you."
2 Corinthians,2,5,"But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all."
2 Corinthians,2,6,"Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many."
2 Corinthians,2,7,"So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow."
2 Corinthians,2,8,Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.
2 Corinthians,2,9,"For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things."
2 Corinthians,2,10,"To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;"
2 Corinthians,2,11,Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.
2 Corinthians,2,12,"Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,"
2 Corinthians,2,13,"I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia."
2 Corinthians,2,14,"Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place."
2 Corinthians,2,15,"For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:"
2 Corinthians,2,16,To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?
2 Corinthians,2,17,"For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ."
2 Corinthians,3,1,"Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?"
2 Corinthians,3,2,"Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:"
2 Corinthians,3,3,"Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart."
2 Corinthians,3,4,And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:
2 Corinthians,3,5,Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;
2 Corinthians,3,6,"Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life."
2 Corinthians,3,7,"But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:"
2 Corinthians,3,8,How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?
2 Corinthians,3,9,"For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory."
2 Corinthians,3,10,"For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth."
2 Corinthians,3,11,"For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious."
2 Corinthians,3,12,"Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:"
2 Corinthians,3,13,"And not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:"
2 Corinthians,3,14,But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ.
2 Corinthians,3,15,"But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart."
2 Corinthians,3,16,"Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away."
2 Corinthians,3,17,"Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."
2 Corinthians,3,18,"But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord."
2 Corinthians,4,1,"Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;"
2 Corinthians,4,2,"But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God."
2 Corinthians,4,3,"But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:"
2 Corinthians,4,4,"In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them."
2 Corinthians,4,5,"For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake."
2 Corinthians,4,6,"For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
2 Corinthians,4,7,"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us."
2 Corinthians,4,8,"We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;"
2 Corinthians,4,9,"Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;"
2 Corinthians,4,10,"Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body."
2 Corinthians,4,11,"For we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh."
2 Corinthians,4,12,"So then death worketh in us, but life in you."
2 Corinthians,4,13,"We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;"
2 Corinthians,4,14,"Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you."
2 Corinthians,4,15,"For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God."
2 Corinthians,4,16,"For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day."
2 Corinthians,4,17,"For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;"
2 Corinthians,4,18,"While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal."
2 Corinthians,5,1,"For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."
2 Corinthians,5,2,"For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:"
2 Corinthians,5,3,If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
2 Corinthians,5,4,"For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life."
2 Corinthians,5,5,"Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit."
2 Corinthians,5,6,"Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:"
2 Corinthians,5,7,"(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)"
2 Corinthians,5,8,"We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord."
2 Corinthians,5,9,"Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him."
2 Corinthians,5,10,"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad."
2 Corinthians,5,11,"Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences."
2 Corinthians,5,12,"For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart."
2 Corinthians,5,13,"For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause."
2 Corinthians,5,14,"For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:"
2 Corinthians,5,15,"And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again."
2 Corinthians,5,16,"Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more."
2 Corinthians,5,17,"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new."
2 Corinthians,5,18,"And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;"
2 Corinthians,5,19,"To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation."
2 Corinthians,5,20,"Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God."
2 Corinthians,5,21,"For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him."
2 Corinthians,6,1,"We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain."
2 Corinthians,6,2,"(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)"
2 Corinthians,6,3,"Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:"
2 Corinthians,6,4,"But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,"
2 Corinthians,6,5,"In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;"
2 Corinthians,6,6,"By pureness, by knowledge, by long suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,"
2 Corinthians,6,7,"By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,"
2 Corinthians,6,8,"By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true;"
2 Corinthians,6,9,"As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;"
2 Corinthians,6,10,"As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things."
2 Corinthians,6,11,"O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged."
2 Corinthians,6,12,"Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels."
2 Corinthians,6,13,"Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be ye also enlarged."
2 Corinthians,6,14,Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?
2 Corinthians,6,15,And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?
2 Corinthians,6,16,"And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people."
2 Corinthians,6,17,"Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you."
2 Corinthians,6,18,"And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty."
2 Corinthians,7,1,"Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God."
2 Corinthians,7,2,"Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man."
2 Corinthians,7,3,"I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you."
2 Corinthians,7,4,"Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation."
2 Corinthians,7,5,"For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears."
2 Corinthians,7,6,"Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;"
2 Corinthians,7,7,"And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more."
2 Corinthians,7,8,"For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season."
2 Corinthians,7,9,"Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing."
2 Corinthians,7,10,For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.
2 Corinthians,7,11,"For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter."
2 Corinthians,7,12,"Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you."
2 Corinthians,7,13,"Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all."
2 Corinthians,7,14,"For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth."
2 Corinthians,7,15,"And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him."
2 Corinthians,7,16,I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.
2 Corinthians,8,1,"Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;"
2 Corinthians,8,2,How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
2 Corinthians,8,3,"For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;"
2 Corinthians,8,4,"Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints."
2 Corinthians,8,5,"And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God."
2 Corinthians,8,6,"Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also."
2 Corinthians,8,7,"Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also."
2 Corinthians,8,8,"I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love."
2 Corinthians,8,9,"For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich."
2 Corinthians,8,10,"And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago."
2 Corinthians,8,11,"Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have."
2 Corinthians,8,12,"For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not."
2 Corinthians,8,13,"For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:"
2 Corinthians,8,14,"But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:"
2 Corinthians,8,15,"As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack."
2 Corinthians,8,16,"But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you."
2 Corinthians,8,17,"For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you."
2 Corinthians,8,18,"And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;"
2 Corinthians,8,19,"And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:"
2 Corinthians,8,20,"Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:"
2 Corinthians,8,21,"Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men."
2 Corinthians,8,22,"And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you."
2 Corinthians,8,23,"Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ."
2 Corinthians,8,24,"Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf."
2 Corinthians,9,1,"For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:"
2 Corinthians,9,2,"For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many."
2 Corinthians,9,3,"Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:"
2 Corinthians,9,4,"Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting."
2 Corinthians,9,5,"Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness."
2 Corinthians,9,6,"But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully."
2 Corinthians,9,7,"Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver."
2 Corinthians,9,8,"And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:"
2 Corinthians,9,9,"(As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever."
2 Corinthians,9,10,"Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)"
2 Corinthians,9,11,"Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God."
2 Corinthians,9,12,"For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;"
2 Corinthians,9,13,"Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;"
2 Corinthians,9,14,"And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you."
2 Corinthians,9,15,Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.
2 Corinthians,10,1,"Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:"
2 Corinthians,10,2,"But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh."
2 Corinthians,10,3,"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:"
2 Corinthians,10,4,"(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)"
2 Corinthians,10,5,"Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;"
2 Corinthians,10,6,"And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled."
2 Corinthians,10,7,"Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? if any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's."
2 Corinthians,10,8,"For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:"
2 Corinthians,10,9,That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.
2 Corinthians,10,10,"For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible."
2 Corinthians,10,11,"Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present."
2 Corinthians,10,12,"For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise."
2 Corinthians,10,13,"But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you."
2 Corinthians,10,14,"For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:"
2 Corinthians,10,15,"Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,"
2 Corinthians,10,16,"To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand."
2 Corinthians,10,17,"But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord."
2 Corinthians,10,18,"For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth."
2 Corinthians,11,1,Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.
2 Corinthians,11,2,"For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ."
2 Corinthians,11,3,"But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ."
2 Corinthians,11,4,"For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him."
2 Corinthians,11,5,For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.
2 Corinthians,11,6,"But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things."
2 Corinthians,11,7,"Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?"
2 Corinthians,11,8,"I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service."
2 Corinthians,11,9,"And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself."
2 Corinthians,11,10,"As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia."
2 Corinthians,11,11,Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.
2 Corinthians,11,12,"But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we."
2 Corinthians,11,13,"For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ."
2 Corinthians,11,14,And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
2 Corinthians,11,15,Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
2 Corinthians,11,16,"I say again, let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little."
2 Corinthians,11,17,"That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting."
2 Corinthians,11,18,"Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also."
2 Corinthians,11,19,"For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise."
2 Corinthians,11,20,"For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face."
2 Corinthians,11,21,"I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also."
2 Corinthians,11,22,Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.
2 Corinthians,11,23,"Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft."
2 Corinthians,11,24,Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.
2 Corinthians,11,25,"Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;"
2 Corinthians,11,26,"In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;"
2 Corinthians,11,27,"In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness."
2 Corinthians,11,28,"Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches."
2 Corinthians,11,29,"Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?"
2 Corinthians,11,30,"If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities."
2 Corinthians,11,31,"The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not."
2 Corinthians,11,32,"In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:"
2 Corinthians,11,33,"And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands."
2 Corinthians,12,1,It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
2 Corinthians,12,2,"I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven."
2 Corinthians,12,3,"And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)"
2 Corinthians,12,4,"How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter."
2 Corinthians,12,5,"Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities."
2 Corinthians,12,6,"For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me."
2 Corinthians,12,7,"And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure."
2 Corinthians,12,8,"For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me."
2 Corinthians,12,9,"And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me."
2 Corinthians,12,10,"Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong."
2 Corinthians,12,11,"I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing."
2 Corinthians,12,12,"Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds."
2 Corinthians,12,13,"For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong."
2 Corinthians,12,14,"Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children."
2 Corinthians,12,15,"And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved."
2 Corinthians,12,16,"But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile."
2 Corinthians,12,17,Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?
2 Corinthians,12,18,"I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?"
2 Corinthians,12,19,"Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying."
2 Corinthians,12,20,"For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:"
2 Corinthians,12,21,"And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed."
2 Corinthians,13,1,This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.
2 Corinthians,13,2,"I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:"
2 Corinthians,13,3,"Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you."
2 Corinthians,13,4,"For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you."
2 Corinthians,13,5,"Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?"
2 Corinthians,13,6,But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.
2 Corinthians,13,7,"Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates."
2 Corinthians,13,8,"For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth."
2 Corinthians,13,9,"For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection."
2 Corinthians,13,10,"Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction."
2 Corinthians,13,11,"Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you."
2 Corinthians,13,12,Greet one another with an holy kiss.
2 Corinthians,13,13,All the saints salute you.
2 Corinthians,13,14,"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen."
Exodus,1,1,"Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob."
Exodus,1,2,"Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,"
Exodus,1,3,"Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,"
Exodus,1,4,"Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher."
Exodus,1,5,And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.
Exodus,1,6,"And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation."
Exodus,1,7,"And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them."
Exodus,1,8,"Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph."
Exodus,1,9,"And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:"
Exodus,1,10,"Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land."
Exodus,1,11,"Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses."
Exodus,1,12,"But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel."
Exodus,1,13,And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:
Exodus,1,14,"And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour."
Exodus,1,15,"And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:"
Exodus,1,16,"And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live."
Exodus,1,17,"But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive."
Exodus,1,18,"And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?"
Exodus,1,19,"And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them."
Exodus,1,20,"Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty."
Exodus,1,21,"And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses."
Exodus,1,22,"And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive."
Exodus,2,1,"And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi."
Exodus,2,2,"And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months."
Exodus,2,3,"And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink."
Exodus,2,4,"And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him."
Exodus,2,5,"And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it."
Exodus,2,6,"And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children."
Exodus,2,7,"Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?"
Exodus,2,8,"And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother."
Exodus,2,9,"And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took the child, and nursed it."
Exodus,2,10,"And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water."
Exodus,2,11,"And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren."
Exodus,2,12,"And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand."
Exodus,2,13,"And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?"
Exodus,2,14,"And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known."
Exodus,2,15,"Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well."
Exodus,2,16,"Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock."
Exodus,2,17,"And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock."
Exodus,2,18,"And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day?"
Exodus,2,19,"And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock."
Exodus,2,20,"And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread."
Exodus,2,21,And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
Exodus,2,22,"And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land."
Exodus,2,23,"And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage."
Exodus,2,24,"And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob."
Exodus,2,25,"And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them."
Exodus,3,1,"Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb."
Exodus,3,2,"And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed."
Exodus,3,3,"And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt."
Exodus,3,4,"And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I."
Exodus,3,5,"And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground."
Exodus,3,6,"Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God."
Exodus,3,7,"And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;"
Exodus,3,8,"And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites."
Exodus,3,9,"Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them."
Exodus,3,10,"Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt."
Exodus,3,11,"And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?"
Exodus,3,12,"And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain."
Exodus,3,13,"And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?"
Exodus,3,14,"And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you."
Exodus,3,15,"And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations."
Exodus,3,16,"Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:"
Exodus,3,17,"And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey."
Exodus,3,18,"And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God."
Exodus,3,19,"And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand."
Exodus,3,20,"And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go."
Exodus,3,21,"And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty."
Exodus,3,22,"But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians."

Exodus,10,6,"And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh."

Exodus,16,29,"See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day."
Exodus,16,30,So the people rested on the seventh day.
Exodus,16,31,"And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey."
Exodus,16,32,"And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt."
Exodus,16,33,"And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations."
Exodus,16,34,"As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept."
Exodus,16,35,"And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan."
Exodus,16,36,Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.
Exodus,17,1,"And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink."
Exodus,17,2,"Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?"
Exodus,17,3,"And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?"
Exodus,17,4,"And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me."
Exodus,17,5,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go."
Exodus,17,6,"Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel."
Exodus,17,7,"And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?"
Exodus,17,8,"Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim."
Exodus,17,9,"And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand."
Exodus,17,10,"So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill."
Exodus,17,11,"And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed."
Exodus,17,12,"But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun."
Exodus,17,13,And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
Exodus,17,14,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven."
Exodus,17,15,"And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:"
Exodus,17,16,"For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation."
Exodus,18,1,"When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;"
Exodus,18,2,"Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,"
Exodus,18,3,"And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:"
Exodus,18,4,"And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:"
Exodus,18,5,"And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:"
Exodus,18,6,"And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her."
Exodus,18,7,"And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent."
Exodus,18,8,"And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them."
Exodus,18,9,"And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians."
Exodus,18,10,"And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians."
Exodus,18,11,Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.
Exodus,18,12,"And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God."
Exodus,18,13,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening."
Exodus,18,14,"And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?"
Exodus,18,15,"And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God:"
Exodus,18,16,"When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws."
Exodus,18,17,"And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good."
Exodus,18,18,"Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone."
Exodus,18,19,"Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:"
Exodus,18,20,"And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do."
Exodus,18,21,"Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:"
Exodus,18,22,"And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee."
Exodus,18,23,"If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace."
Exodus,18,24,"So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said."
Exodus,18,25,"And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens."
Exodus,18,26,"And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves."
Exodus,18,27,And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.
Exodus,19,1,"In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai."
Exodus,19,2,"For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount."
Exodus,19,3,"And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;"
Exodus,19,4,"Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself."
Exodus,19,5,"Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine:"
Exodus,19,6,"And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel."
Exodus,19,7,"And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him."
Exodus,19,8,"And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD."
Exodus,19,9,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD."
Exodus,19,10,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,"
Exodus,19,11,And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.
Exodus,19,12,"And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:"
Exodus,19,13,"There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount."
Exodus,19,14,"And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes."
Exodus,19,15,"And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives."
Exodus,19,16,"And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled."
Exodus,19,17,And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.
Exodus,19,18,"And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly."
Exodus,19,19,"And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice."
Exodus,19,20,"And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up."
Exodus,19,21,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish."
Exodus,19,22,"And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them."
Exodus,19,23,"And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it."
Exodus,19,24,"And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them."
Exodus,19,25,"So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them."
Exodus,20,1,"And God spake all these words, saying,"
Exodus,20,2,"I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage."
Exodus,20,3,Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
Exodus,20,4,"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth."
Exodus,20,5,"Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;"
Exodus,20,6,"And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments."
Exodus,20,7,Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
Exodus,20,8,"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy."
Exodus,20,9,"Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:"
Exodus,20,10,"But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:"
Exodus,20,11,"For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it."
Exodus,20,12,Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
Exodus,20,13,Thou shalt not kill.
Exodus,20,14,Thou shalt not commit adultery.

Exodus,20,17,"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's."
Exodus,20,18,"And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off."
Exodus,20,19,"And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die."
Exodus,20,20,"And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not."
Exodus,20,21,"And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was."
Exodus,20,22,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven."
Exodus,20,23,"Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold."
Exodus,20,24,"An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee."
Exodus,20,25,"And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it."
Exodus,20,26,"Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon."
Exodus,21,1,Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.
Exodus,21,2,"If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing."
Exodus,21,3,"If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him."
Exodus,21,4,"If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself."
Exodus,21,5,"And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:"
Exodus,21,6,"Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever."
Exodus,21,7,"And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do."
Exodus,21,8,"If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her."
Exodus,21,9,"And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters."
Exodus,21,10,"If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish."

Exodus,21,12,"He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death."
Exodus,21,13,"And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee."
Exodus,21,14,"But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die."
Exodus,21,15,"And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death."
Exodus,21,16,"And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death."
Exodus,21,17,"And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death."
Exodus,21,18,"And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:"
Exodus,21,19,"If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed."
Exodus,21,20,"And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished."
Exodus,21,21,"Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money."
Exodus,21,22,"If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine."

Exodus,21,24,"Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,"
Exodus,21,25,"Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe."
Exodus,21,26,"And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake."
Exodus,21,27,"And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake."
Exodus,21,28,"If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit."
Exodus,21,29,"But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death."
Exodus,21,30,"If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him."
Exodus,21,31,"Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him."
Exodus,21,32,"If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned."

Exodus,21,34,"The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his."
Exodus,21,35,"And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they shall divide."

Exodus,22,4,"If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double."
Exodus,22,5,"If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution."
Exodus,22,6,"If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution."
Exodus,22,7,"If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let him pay double."
Exodus,22,8,"If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour's goods."
Exodus,22,9,"For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which another challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour."
Exodus,22,10,"If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:"
Exodus,22,11,"Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good."
Exodus,22,12,"And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof."
Exodus,22,13,"If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and he shall not make good that which was torn."
Exodus,22,14,"And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it good."
Exodus,22,15,"But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire."
Exodus,22,16,"And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife."
Exodus,22,17,"If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins."

Exodus,22,26,"If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:"
Exodus,22,27,"For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious."
Exodus,22,28,"Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people."

Leviticus,2,3,And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.
Leviticus,2,4,"And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil."
Leviticus,2,5,"And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil."
Leviticus,2,6,"Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meat offering."
Leviticus,2,7,"And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil."
Leviticus,2,8,"And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall bring it unto the altar."
Leviticus,2,9,"And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD."
Leviticus,2,10,And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.
Leviticus,2,11,"No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire."
Leviticus,2,12,"As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour."
Leviticus,2,13,And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.
Leviticus,2,14,"And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears."
Leviticus,2,15,"And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meat offering."
Leviticus,2,16,"And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD."
Leviticus,3,1,"And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD."
Leviticus,3,2,"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about."
Leviticus,3,3,"And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,"
Leviticus,3,4,"And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away."
Leviticus,3,5,"And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD."
Leviticus,3,6,"And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the LORD be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish."
Leviticus,3,7,"If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before the LORD."
Leviticus,3,8,"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar."
Leviticus,3,9,"And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, and the whole rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,"
Leviticus,3,10,"And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away."

Leviticus,3,15,"And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away."
Leviticus,3,16,And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat is the LORD's.
Leviticus,3,17,"It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood."
Leviticus,4,1,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,4,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them:"
Leviticus,4,3,"If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering."
Leviticus,4,4,"And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD."
Leviticus,4,5,"And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:"
Leviticus,4,6,"And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary."
Leviticus,4,7,"And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation."
Leviticus,4,8,"And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,"
Leviticus,4,9,"And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away,"
Leviticus,4,10,As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering.
Leviticus,4,11,"And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,"
Leviticus,4,12,"Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt."
Leviticus,4,13,"And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty;"
Leviticus,4,14,"When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation."
Leviticus,4,15,And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD.
Leviticus,4,16,And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:
Leviticus,4,17,"And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the vail."
Leviticus,4,18,"And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation."
Leviticus,4,19,"And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the altar."
Leviticus,4,20,"And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them."
Leviticus,4,21,"And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for the congregation."
Leviticus,4,22,"When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things which should not be done, and is guilty;"
Leviticus,4,23,"Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish:"
Leviticus,4,24,"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a sin offering."
Leviticus,4,25,"And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering."
Leviticus,4,26,"And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him."
Leviticus,4,27,"And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty;"
Leviticus,4,28,"Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned."
Leviticus,4,29,"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering."
Leviticus,4,30,"And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar."
Leviticus,4,31,"And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him."
Leviticus,4,32,"And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish."
Leviticus,4,33,"And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering."
Leviticus,4,34,"And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar:"
Leviticus,4,35,"And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him."
Leviticus,5,1,"And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a witness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity."
Leviticus,5,2,"Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty."
Leviticus,5,3,"Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it be that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty."
Leviticus,5,4,"Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these."
Leviticus,5,5,"And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing:"
Leviticus,5,6,"And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin."
Leviticus,5,7,"And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering."
Leviticus,5,8,"And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from his neck, but shall not divide it asunder:"
Leviticus,5,9,And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is a sin offering.
Leviticus,5,10,"And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him."
Leviticus,5,11,"But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a sin offering."
Leviticus,5,12,"Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: it is a sin offering."
Leviticus,5,13,"And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him: and the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat offering."
Leviticus,5,14,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,5,15,"If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering."
Leviticus,5,16,"And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him."
Leviticus,5,17,"And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wist it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity."
Leviticus,5,18,"And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven him."
Leviticus,5,19,It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against the LORD.
Leviticus,6,1,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,6,2,"If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour;"
Leviticus,6,3,"Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein:"
Leviticus,6,4,"Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found,"
Leviticus,6,5,"Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day of his trespass offering."
Leviticus,6,6,"And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest:"
Leviticus,6,7,And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing therein.
Leviticus,6,8,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,6,9,"Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it."
Leviticus,6,10,"And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar."
Leviticus,6,11,"And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place."
Leviticus,6,12,"And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings."
Leviticus,6,13,The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out.
Leviticus,6,14,"And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar."
Leviticus,6,15,"And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour, even the memorial of it, unto the LORD."
Leviticus,6,16,And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.
Leviticus,6,17,"It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the sin offering, and as the trespass offering."
Leviticus,6,18,All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall be holy.
Leviticus,6,19,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,6,20,"This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at night."
Leviticus,6,21,"In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou shalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD."
Leviticus,6,22,And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be wholly burnt.
Leviticus,6,23,For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten.
Leviticus,6,24,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,6,25,"Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is most holy."
Leviticus,6,26,"The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation."
Leviticus,6,27,"Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place."
Leviticus,6,28,"But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed in water."
Leviticus,6,29,All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most holy.
Leviticus,6,30,"And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire."
Leviticus,7,1,Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most holy.
Leviticus,7,2,In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar.
Leviticus,7,3,"And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards,"
Leviticus,7,4,"And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away:"
Leviticus,7,5,And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a trespass offering.
Leviticus,7,6,Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in the holy place: it is most holy.
Leviticus,7,7,"As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it."
Leviticus,7,8,"And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered."
Leviticus,7,9,"And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's that offereth it."
Leviticus,7,10,"And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another."
Leviticus,7,11,"And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer unto the LORD."
Leviticus,7,12,"If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried."
Leviticus,7,13,"Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings."
Leviticus,7,14,"And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings."
Leviticus,7,15,And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.
Leviticus,7,16,"But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:"
Leviticus,7,17,But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.
Leviticus,7,18,"And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity."
Leviticus,7,19,"And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof."
Leviticus,7,20,"But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people."
Leviticus,7,21,"Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people."
Leviticus,7,22,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,7,23,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat."
Leviticus,7,24,"And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye shall in no wise eat of it."
Leviticus,7,25,"For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people."
Leviticus,7,26,"Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings."
Leviticus,7,27,"Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people."
Leviticus,7,28,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,7,29,"Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace offerings."
Leviticus,7,30,"His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD."
Leviticus,7,31,And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'.
Leviticus,7,32,And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.
Leviticus,7,33,"He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part."
Leviticus,7,34,"For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel."
Leviticus,7,35,"This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest's office;"
Leviticus,7,36,"Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout their generations."
Leviticus,7,37,"This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings;"
Leviticus,7,38,"Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai."
Leviticus,8,1,"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,8,2,"Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;"
Leviticus,8,3,And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
Leviticus,8,4,And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
Leviticus,8,5,"And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the LORD commanded to be done."
Leviticus,8,6,"And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water."
Leviticus,8,7,"And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith."
Leviticus,8,8,And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.
Leviticus,8,9,"And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,10,"And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them."
Leviticus,8,11,"And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them."
Leviticus,8,12,"And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him."
Leviticus,8,13,"And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,14,And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering.
Leviticus,8,15,"And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it."
Leviticus,8,16,"And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned it upon the altar."
Leviticus,8,17,"But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,18,And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
Leviticus,8,19,And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
Leviticus,8,20,"And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat."
Leviticus,8,21,"And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour, and an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,22,"And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram."
Leviticus,8,23,"And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot."
Leviticus,8,24,"And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about."
Leviticus,8,25,"And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:"
Leviticus,8,26,"And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and upon the right shoulder:"
Leviticus,8,27,"And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them for a wave offering before the LORD."
Leviticus,8,28,"And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD."
Leviticus,8,29,"And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; as the LORD commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,30,"And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him."
Leviticus,8,31,"And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it."
Leviticus,8,32,And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.
Leviticus,8,33,"And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you."
Leviticus,8,34,"As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to make an atonement for you."
Leviticus,8,35,"Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded."
Leviticus,8,36,So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.
Leviticus,9,1,"And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;"
Leviticus,9,2,"And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD."
Leviticus,9,3,"And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;"
Leviticus,9,4,"Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you."
Leviticus,9,5,And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.
Leviticus,9,6,"And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you."
Leviticus,9,7,"And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded."
Leviticus,9,8,"Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself."
Leviticus,9,9,"And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:"
Leviticus,9,10,"But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses."
Leviticus,9,11,And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.
Leviticus,9,12,"And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar."
Leviticus,9,13,"And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar."
Leviticus,9,14,"And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar."
Leviticus,9,15,"And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first."
Leviticus,9,16,"And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner."
Leviticus,9,17,"And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning."
Leviticus,9,18,"He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,"
Leviticus,9,19,"And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:"
Leviticus,9,20,"And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:"
Leviticus,9,21,And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.
Leviticus,9,22,"And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings."
Leviticus,9,23,"And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people."
Leviticus,9,24,"And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces."
Leviticus,10,1,"And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not."
Leviticus,10,2,"And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD."
Leviticus,10,3,"Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace."
Leviticus,10,4,"And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp."
Leviticus,10,5,"So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said."
Leviticus,10,6,"And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled."
Leviticus,10,7,"And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses."
Leviticus,10,8,"And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,"
Leviticus,10,9,"Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:"
Leviticus,10,10,"And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;"
Leviticus,10,11,And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.
Leviticus,10,12,"And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy:"
Leviticus,10,13,"And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded."
Leviticus,10,14,"And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel."
Leviticus,10,15,"The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded."
Leviticus,10,16,"And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,"
Leviticus,10,17,"Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?"
Leviticus,10,18,"Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded."
