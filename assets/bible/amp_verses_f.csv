Acts,16,19,But when her owners discovered that their hope of profit was gone they caught hold of Paul and Silas and dragged them before the authorities in the forum (marketplace) [where trials are held].
Acts,16,20,And when they had brought them before the magistrates they declared These fellows are Jews and they are throwing our city into great confusion.
Acts,16,21,They encourage the practice of customs which it is unlawful for us Romans to accept or observe!
Acts,16,22,The crowd [also] joined in the attack upon them and the rulers tore the clothes off of them and commanded that they be beaten with rods.
Acts,16,23,And when they had struck them with many blows they threw them into prison charging the jailer to keep them safely.
Acts,16,24,He having received [so strict a] charge put them into the inner prison (the dungeon) and fastened their feet in the stocks.
Acts,16,25,But about midnight as Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God and the [other] prisoners were listening to them
Acts,16,26,Suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the very foundations of the prison were shaken; and at once all the doors were opened and everyone's shackles were unfastened.
Acts,16,27,When the jailer startled out of his sleep saw that the prison doors were open he drew his sword and was on the point of killing himself because he supposed that the prisoners had escaped.
Acts,16,28,But Paul shouted Do not harm yourself for we are all here!
Acts,16,29,Then [the jailer] called for lights and rushed in and trembling and terrified he fell down before Paul and Silas.
Acts,16,30,And he brought them out [of the dungeon] and said Men what is it necessary for me to do that I may be saved?
Acts,16,31,And they answered Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ [ give yourself up to Him take yourself out of your own keeping and entrust yourself into His keeping] and you will be saved [and this applies both to] you and your household as well.
Acts,16,32,And they declared the Word of the Lord [the doctrine concerning the attainment through Christ of eternal salvation in the kingdom of God] to him and to all who were in his house.
Acts,16,33,And he took them the same hour of the night and bathed [them because of their bloody] wounds and he was baptized immediately and all [the members of] his [household].
Acts,16,34,Then he took them up into his house and set food before them; and he leaped much for joy and exulted with all his family that he believed in God [accepting and joyously welcoming what He had made known through Christ].
Acts,16,35,But when it was day the magistrates sent policemen saying Release those fellows and let them go.
Acts,16,36,And the jailer repeated the words to Paul saying The magistrates have sent to release you and let you go; now therefore come out and go in peace.
Acts,16,37,But Paul answered them They have beaten us openly and publicly without a trial and uncondemned men who are Roman citizens and have thrown us into prison; and do they now thrust us out secretly? No indeed! Let them come here themselves and conduct us out!
Acts,16,38,The police reported this message to the magistrates and they were frightened when they heard that the prisoners were Roman citizens;
Acts,16,39,So they came themselves and [striving to appease them by entreaty] apologized to them. And they brought them out and asked them to leave the city.
Acts,16,40,So [Paul and Silas] left the prison and went to Lydia's house; and when they had seen the brethren they warned and urged and consoled and encouraged them and departed.
Acts,17,1,NOW AFTER [Paul and Silas] had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia they came to Thessalonica where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
Acts,17,2,And Paul entered as he usually did and for three Sabbaths he reasoned and argued with them from the Scriptures
Acts,17,3,Explaining [them] and [quoting passages] setting forth and proving that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead and saying This Jesus Whom I proclaim to you is the Christ (the Messiah).
Acts,17,4,And some of them [accordingly] were induced to believe and associated themselves with Paul and Silas as did a great number of the devout Greeks and not a few of the leading women.
Acts,17,5,But the unbelieving Jews were aroused to jealousy and getting hold of some wicked men (ruffians and rascals) and loungers in the marketplace they gathered together a mob set the town in an uproar and attacked the house of Jason seeking to bring [Paul and Silas] out to the people.
Acts,17,6,But when they failed to find them they dragged Jason and some of the brethren before the city authorities crying These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also
Acts,17,7,And Jason has received them to his house and privately protected them! And they are all ignoring and acting contrary to the decrees of Caesar [actually] asserting that there is another king one Jesus!
Acts,17,8,And both the crowd and the city authorities on hearing this were irritated (stirred up and troubled).
Acts,17,9,And when they had taken security [bail] from Jason and the others they let them go.
Acts,17,10,Now the brethren at once sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea; and when they arrived they entered the synagogue of the Jews.
Acts,17,11,Now these [Jews] were better disposed and more noble than those in Thessalonica for they were entirely ready and accepted and welcomed the message [ concerning the attainment through Christ of eternal salvation in the kingdom of God] with inclination of mind and eagerness searching and examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.
Acts,17,12,Many of them therefore became believers together with not a few prominent Greeks women as well as men.
Acts,17,13,But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that the Word of God [ concerning the attainment through Christ of eternal salvation in the kingdom of God] was also preached by Paul at Beroea they came there too disturbing and inciting the masses.
Acts,17,14,At once the brethren sent Paul off on his way to the sea but Silas and Timothy remained behind.
Acts,17,15,Those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and receiving instructions for Silas and Timothy that they should come to him as soon as possible they departed.
Acts,17,16,Now while Paul was awaiting them at Athens his spirit was grieved and roused to anger as he saw that the city was full of idols.
Acts,17,17,So he reasoned and argued in the synagogue with the Jews and those who worshiped there and in the marketplace [where assemblies are held] day after day with any who chanced to be there.
Acts,17,18,And some also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him and began to engage in discussion. And some said What is this babbler with his scrap-heap learning trying to say? Others said He seems to be an announcer of foreign deities--because he preached Jesus and the resurrection.
Acts,17,19,And they took hold of him and brought him to the Areopagus [Mars Hill meeting place] saying May we know what this novel (unheard of and unprecedented) teaching is which you are openly declaring?
Acts,17,20,For you set forth some startling things foreign and strange to our ears; we wish to know therefore just what these things mean--
Acts,17,21,For the Athenians all of them and the foreign residents and visitors among them spent all their leisure time in nothing except telling or hearing something newer than the last--
Acts,17,22,So Paul standing in the center of the Areopagus [Mars Hill meeting place] said: Men of Athens I perceive in every way [on every hand and with every turn I make] that you are most religious or very reverent to demons.
Acts,17,23,For as I passed along and carefully observed your objects of worship I came also upon an altar with this inscription To the unknown god. Now what you are already worshiping as unknown this I set forth to you.
Acts,17,24,The God Who produced and formed the world and all things in it being Lord of heaven and earth does not dwell in handmade shrines.
Acts,17,25,Neither is He served by human hands as though He lacked anything for it is He Himself Whogives life and breath and all things to all [people].
Acts,17,26,And He made from one [common origin one source one blood] all nations of men to settle on the face of the earth having definitely determined [their] allotted periods of time and the fixed boundaries of their habitation (their settlements lands and abodes)
Acts,17,27,So that they should seek God in the hope that they might feel after Him and find Him although He is not far from each one of us.
Acts,17,28,For in Him we live and move and have our being; as even some of your [own] poets have said For we are also His offspring.
Acts,17,29,Since then we are God's offspring we ought not to suppose that Deity (the Godhead) is like gold or silver or stone [of the nature of] a representation by human art and imagination or anything constructed or invented.
Acts,17,30,Such [former] ages of ignorance God it is true ignored and allowed to pass unnoticed; but now He charges all people everywhere to repent ( to change their minds for the better and heartily to amend their ways with abhorrence of their past sins)
Acts,17,31,Because He has fixed a day when He will judge the world righteously (justly) by a Man Whom He has destined and appointed for that task and He has made this credible and given conviction and assurance and evidence to everyone by raising Him from the dead.
Acts,17,32,Now when they had heard [that there had been] a resurrection from the dead some scoffed; but others said We will hear you again about this matter.
Acts,17,33,So Paul went out from among them.
Acts,17,34,But some men were on his side and joined him and believed (became Christians); among them were Dionysius a judge of the Areopagus and a woman named Damaris and some others with them.
Acts,18,1,AFTER THIS [Paul] departed from Athens and went to Corinth.
Acts,18,2,There he met a Jew named Aquila a native of Pontus recently arrived from Italy with Priscilla his wife due to the fact that Claudius had issued an edict that all the Jews were to leave Rome. And [Paul] went to see them
Acts,18,3,And because he was of the same occupation he stayed with them; and they worked [together] for they were tentmakers by trade.
Acts,18,4,But he discoursed and argued in the synagogue every Sabbath and won over [both] Jews and Greeks.
Acts,18,5,By the time Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia Paul was completely engrossed with preaching earnestly arguing and testifying to the Jews that Jesus [is] the Christ.
Acts,18,6,But since they kept opposing and abusing and reviling him he shook out his clothing [against them] and said to them Your blood be upon your [own] heads! I am innocent [of it]. From now on I will go to the Gentiles (the heathen).
Acts,18,7,He then left there and went to the house of a man named Titus Justus who worshiped God and whose house was next door to the synagogue.
Acts,18,8,But Crispus the leader of the synagogue believed [that Jesus is the Messiah and acknowledged Him with joyful trust as Savior and Lord] together with his entire household; and many of the Corinthians who listened [to Paul also] believed and were baptized.
Acts,18,9,And one night the Lord said to Paul in a vision Have no fear but speak and do not keep silent;
Acts,18,10,For I am with you and no man shall assault you to harm you for I have many people in this city.
Acts,18,11,So he settled down among them for a year and six months teaching the Word of God [concerning the attainment through Christ of eternal salvation in the kingdom of God].
Acts,18,12,But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia (most of Greece) the Jews unitedly made an attack upon Paul and brought him before the judge's seat
Acts,18,13,Declaring This fellow is advising and inducing and inciting people to worship God in violation of the Law [of Rome and of Moses].
Acts,18,14,But when Paul was about to open his mouth to reply Gallio said to the Jews If it were a matter of some misdemeanor or villainy O Jews I should have cause to bear with you and listen;
Acts,18,15,But since it is merely a question [of doctrine] about words and names and your own law see to it yourselves; I decline to be a judge of such matters and I have no intention of trying such cases.
Acts,18,16,And he drove them away from the judgment seat.
Acts,18,17,Then they [the Greeks] all seized Sosthenes the leader of the synagogue and beat him right in front of the judgment seat. But Gallio paid no attention to any of this.
Acts,18,18,Afterward Paul remained many days longer and then told the brethren farewell and sailed for Syria; and he was accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. At Cenchreae he [ Paul] cut his hair for he had made a vow.
Acts,18,19,Then they arrived in Ephesus and [Paul] left the others there; but he himself entered the synagogue and discoursed and argued with the Jews.
Acts,18,20,When they asked him to remain for a longer time he would not consent;
Acts,18,21,But when he was leaving them he said I will return to you if God is willing and he set sail from Ephesus.
Acts,18,22,When he landed at Caesarea he went up and saluted the church [at Jerusalem] and then went down to Antioch.
Acts,18,23,After staying there some time he left and went from place to place in an orderly journey through the territory of Galatia and Phrygia establishing the disciples and imparting new strength to them.
Acts,18,24,Meanwhile there was a Jew named Apollos a native of Alexandria who came to Ephesus. He was a cultured and eloquent man well versed and mighty in the Scriptures.
Acts,18,25,He had been instructed in the way of the Lord and burning with spiritual zeal he spoke and taught diligently and accurately the things concerning Jesus though he was acquainted only with the baptism of John.
Acts,18,26,He began to speak freely (fearlessly and boldly) in the synagogue; but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him they took him with them and expounded to him the way of God more definitely and accurately.
Acts,18,27,And when [Apollos] wished to cross to Achaia (most of Greece) the brethren wrote to the disciples there urging and encouraging them to accept and welcome him heartily. When he arrived he proved a great help to those who through grace (God's unmerited favor and mercy) had believed (adhered to trusted in and relied on Christ as Lord and Savior).
Acts,18,28,For with great power he refuted the Jews in public [discussions] showing and proving by the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ (the Messiah).
Acts,19,1,WHILE APOLLOS was in Corinth Paul went through the upper inland districts and came down to Ephesus. There he found some disciples.
Acts,19,2,And he asked them Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed [on Jesus as the Christ]? And they said No we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.
Acts,19,3,And he asked Into what [baptism] then were you baptized? They said Into John's baptism.
Acts,19,4,And Paul said John baptized with the baptism of repentance continually telling the people that they should believe in the One Who was to come after him that is in Jesus [having a conviction full of joyful trust that He is Christ the Messiah and being obedient to Him].
Acts,19,5,On hearing this they were baptized [again this time] in the name of the Lord Jesus.
Acts,19,6,And as Paul laid his hands upon them the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spoke in [foreign unknown] tongues (languages) and prophesied.
Acts,19,7,There were about twelve of them in all.
Acts,19,8,And he went into the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly persuading and arguing and pleading about the kingdom of God.
Acts,19,9,But when some became more and more stubborn (hardened and unbelieving) discrediting and reviling and speaking evil of the Way [of the Lord] before the congregation he separated himself from them taking the disciples with him and went on holding daily discussions in the lecture room of Tyrannus from about ten o'clock till three.
Acts,19,10,This continued for two years so that all the inhabitants of [the province of] Asia Jews as well as Greeks heard the Word of the Lord [concerning the attainment through Christ of eternal salvation in the kingdom of God].
Acts,19,11,And God did unusual and extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul
Acts,19,12,So that handkerchiefs or towels or aprons which had touched his skin were carried away and put upon the sick and their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them.
Acts,19,13,Then some of the traveling Jewish exorcists (men who adjure evil spirits) also undertook to call the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits saying I solemnly implore and charge you by the Jesus Whom Paul preaches!
Acts,19,14,Seven sons of a certain Jewish chief priest named Sceva were doing this.
Acts,19,15,But [one] evil spirit retorted Jesus I know and Paul I know about but who are you?
Acts,19,16,Then the man in whom the evil spirit dwelt leaped upon them mastering two of them and was so violent against them that they dashed out of that house [in fear] stripped naked and wounded.
Acts,19,17,This became known to all who lived in Ephesus both Jews and Greeks and alarm and terror fell upon them all; and the name of the Lord Jesus was extolled and magnified.
Acts,19,18,Many also of those who were now believers came making full confession and thoroughly exposing their [former deceptive and evil] practices.
Acts,19,19,And many of those who had practiced curious magical arts collected their books and [throwing them book after book on the pile] burned them in the sight of everybody. When they counted the value of them they found it amounted to 50000 pieces of silver ( about $9300).
Acts,19,20,Thus the Word of the Lord [concerning the attainment through Christ of eternal salvation in the kingdom of God] grew and spread and intensified prevailing mightily.
Acts,19,21,Now after these events Paul determined in the [Holy] Spirit that he would travel through Macedonia and Achaia (most of Greece) and go to Jerusalem saying After I have been there I must visit Rome also.
Acts,19,22,And having sent two of his assistants Timothy and Erastus into Macedonia he himself stayed on in [the province of] Asia for a while.
Acts,19,23,But as time went on there arose no little disturbance concerning the Way [of the Lord].
Acts,19,24,For a man named Demetrius a silversmith who made silver shrines of [the goddess] Artemis [Diana] brought no small income to his craftsmen.
Acts,19,25,These he called together along with the workmen of similar trades and said Men you are acquainted with the facts and understand that from this business we derive our wealth and livelihood.
Acts,19,26,Now you notice and hear that not only at Ephesus but almost all over [the province of] Asia this Paul has persuaded and induced people to believe his teaching and has alienated a considerable company of them saying that gods that are made with human hands are not really gods at all.
Acts,19,27,Now there is danger not merely that this trade of ours may be discredited but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis may come into disrepute and count for nothing and that her glorious magnificence may be degraded and fall into contempt--she whom all [the province of Asia] and the wide world worship.
Acts,19,28,As they listened to this they were filled with rage and they continued to shout Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!
Acts,19,29,Then the city was filled with confusion; and they rushed together into the amphitheater dragging along with them Gaius and Aristarchus Macedonians who were fellow travelers with Paul.
Acts,19,30,Paul wished to go in among the crowd but the disciples would not permit him to do it.
Acts,19,31,Even some of the Asiarchs (political or religious officials in Asia) who were his friends also sent to him and warned him not to risk venturing into the theater.
Acts,19,32,Now some shouted one thing and some another for the gathering was in a tumult and most of them did not know why they had come together.
Acts,19,33,Some of the crowd called upon Alexander [to speak] since the Jews had pushed and urged him forward. And Alexander motioned with his hand wishing to make a defense and [planning] to apologize to the people.
Acts,19,34,But as soon as they saw him and recognized that he was a Jew a shout went up from them as the voice of one man as for about two hours they cried Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!
Acts,19,35,And when the town clerk had calmed the crowd down he said Men of Ephesus what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of the sacred stone [image of her] that fell from the sky?
Acts,19,36,Seeing then that these things cannot be denied you ought to be quiet (keep yourselves in check) and do nothing rashly.
Acts,19,37,For you have brought these men here who are [guilty of] neither temple robberies nor blasphemous speech about our goddess.
Acts,19,38,Now then if Demetrius and his fellow tradesmen who are with him have a grievance against anyone the courts are open and proconsuls are [available]; let them bring charges against one another [legally].
Acts,19,39,But if you require anything further about this or about other matters it must be decided and cleared up in the regular assembly.
Acts,19,40,For we are in danger of being called to render an account and of being accused of rioting because of [this commotion] today there being no reason that we can offer to justify this disorder.
Acts,19,41,And when he had said these things he dismissed the assembly.
Acts,20,1,AFTER THE uproar had ceased Paul sent for the disciples and warned and consoled and urged and encouraged them; then he embraced them and told them farewell and set forth on his journey to Macedonia.
Acts,20,2,Then after he had gone through those districts and had warned and consoled and urged and encouraged the brethren with much discourse he came to Greece.
Acts,20,3,Having spent three months there when a plot was formed against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria he resolved to go back through Macedonia.
Acts,20,4,He was accompanied by Sopater the son of Pyrrhus from Beroea and by the Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus and Gaius of Derbe and Timothy and the Asians Tychicus and Trophimus.
Acts,20,5,These went on ahead and were waiting for us [including Luke] at Troas
Acts,20,6,But we [ourselves] sailed from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread [the Passover week] and in five days we joined them at Troas where we remained for seven days.
Acts,20,7,And on the first day of the week when we were assembled together to break bread [ the Lord's Supper] Paul discoursed with them intending to leave the next morning; and he kept on with his message until midnight.
Acts,20,8,Now there were numerous lights in the upper room where we were assembled
Acts,20,9,And there was a young man named Eutychus sitting in the window. He was borne down with deep sleep as Paul kept on talking still longer and [finally] completely overcome by sleep he fell down from the third story and was picked up dead.
Acts,20,10,But Paul went down and bent over him and embraced him saying Make no ado; his life is within him.
Acts,20,11,When Paul had gone back upstairs and had broken bread and eaten [with them] and after he had talked confidentially and communed with them for a considerable time--until daybreak [in fact]--he departed.
Acts,20,12,They took the youth home alive and were not a little comforted and cheered and refreshed and encouraged.
Acts,20,13,But going on ahead to the ship the rest of us set sail for Assos intending to take Paul aboard there for that was what he had directed intending himself to go by land [on foot].
Acts,20,14,So when he met us at Assos we took him aboard and sailed on to Mitylene.
Acts,20,15,And sailing from there we arrived the day after at a point opposite Chios; the following day we struck across to Samos and the next day we arrived at Miletus.
Acts,20,16,For Paul had determined to sail on past Ephesus lest he might have to spend time [unnecessarily] in [the province of] Asia; for he was hastening on so that he might reach Jerusalem if at all possible by the day of Pentecost.
Acts,20,17,However from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and summoned the elders of the church [to come to him there].
Acts,20,18,And when they arrived he said to them: You yourselves are well acquainted with my manner of living among you from the first day that I set foot in [the province of] Asia and how I continued afterward
Acts,20,19,Serving the Lord with all humility in tears and in the midst of adversity (affliction and trials) which befell me due to the plots of the Jews [against me];
Acts,20,20,How I did not shrink from telling you anything that was for your benefit and teaching you in public meetings and from house to house
Acts,20,21,But constantly and earnestly I bore testimony both to Jews and Greeks urging them to turn in repentance [ that is due] to God and to have faith in our Lord Jesus Christ [ that is due Him].
Acts,20,22,And now you see I am going to Jerusalem bound by the [Holy] Spirit and obligated and compelled by the [convictions of my own] spirit not knowing what will befall me there--
Acts,20,23,Except that the Holy Spirit clearly and emphatically affirms to me in city after city that imprisonment and suffering await me.
Acts,20,24,But none of these things move me; neither do I esteem my life dear to myself if only I may finish my course with joy and the ministry which I have obtained from [which was entrusted to me by] the Lord Jesus faithfully to attest to the good news (Gospel) of God's grace (His unmerited favor spiritual blessing and mercy).
Acts,20,25,And now observe I perceive that all of you among whom I have gone in and out proclaiming the kingdom will see my face no more.
Acts,20,26,Therefore I testify and protest to you on this [our parting] day that I am clean and innocent and not responsible for the blood of any of you.
Acts,20,27,For I never shrank or kept back or fell short from declaring to you the whole purpose and plan and counsel of God.
Acts,20,28,Take care and be on guard for yourselves and the whole flock over which the Holy Spirit has appointed you bishops and guardians to shepherd (tend and feed and guide) the church of the Lord or of God which He obtained for Himself [buying it and saving it for Himself] with His own blood.
Acts,20,29,I know that after I am gone ferocious wolves will get in among you not sparing the flock;
Acts,20,30,Even from among your own selves men will come to the front who by saying perverse (distorted and corrupt) things will endeavor to draw away the disciples after them [to their own party].
Acts,20,31,Therefore be always alert and on your guard being mindful that for three years I never stopped night or day seriously to admonish and advise and exhort you one by one with tears.
Acts,20,32,And now [brethren] I commit you to God [I deposit you in His charge entrusting you to His protection and care]. And I commend you to the Word of His grace [to the commands and counsels and promises of His unmerited favor]. It is able to build you up and to give you [your rightful] inheritance among all God's set-apart ones (those consecrated purified and transformed of soul).
Acts,20,33,I coveted no man's silver or gold or [costly] garments.
Acts,20,34,You yourselves know personally that these hands ministered to my own needs and those [of the persons] who were with me.
Acts,20,35,In everything I have pointed out to you [by example] that by working diligently in this manner we ought to assist the weak being mindful of the words of the Lord Jesus how He Himself said It is more blessed (makes one happier and more to be envied) to give than to receive.
Acts,20,36,Having spoken thus he knelt down with them all and prayed.
Acts,20,37,And they all wept freely and threw their arms around Paul's neck and kissed him fervently and repeatedly
Acts,20,38,Being especially distressed and sorrowful because he had stated that they were about to see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.
Acts,21,1,AND WHEN we had torn ourselves away from them and withdrawn we set sail and made a straight run to Cos and on the following [day came] to Rhodes and from there to Patara.
Acts,21,2,There we found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia; so we went aboard and sailed away.
Acts,21,3,After we had sighted Cyprus leaving it on our left we sailed on to Syria and put in at Tyre for there the ship was to unload her cargo.
Acts,21,4,And having looked up the disciples there we remained with them for seven days. Prompted by the [Holy] Spirit they kept telling Paul not to set foot in Jerusalem.
Acts,21,5,But when our time there was ended we left and proceeded on our journey; and all of them with their wives and children accompanied us on our way till we were outside the city. There we knelt down on the beach and prayed.
Acts,21,6,Then when we had told one another farewell we went on board the ship and they returned to their own homes.
Acts,21,7,When we had completed the voyage from Tyre we landed at Ptolemais where we paid our respects to the brethren and remained with them for one day.
Acts,21,8,On the morrow we left there and came to Caesarea; and we went into the house of Philip the evangelist who was one of the Seven [first deacons] and stayed with him.
Acts,21,9,And he had four maiden daughters who had the gift of prophecy.
Acts,21,10,While we were remaining there for some time a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.
Acts,21,11,And coming to [see] us he took Paul's belt and with it bound his own feet and hands and said Thus says the Holy Spirit: The Jews at Jerusalem shall bind like this the man who owns this belt and they shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles (heathen).
Acts,21,12,When we heard this both we and the residents of that place pleaded with him not to go up to Jerusalem.
Acts,21,13,Then Paul replied What do you mean by weeping and breaking my heart like this? For I hold myself in readiness not only to be arrested and bound and imprisoned at Jerusalem but also [even] to die for the name of the Lord Jesus.
Acts,21,14,And when he would not yield to [our] persuading we stopped [urging and imploring him] saying The Lord's will be done!
Acts,21,15,After these days we packed our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.
Acts,21,16,And some of the disciples from Caesarea came with us conducting us to the house of Mnason a man from Cyprus one of the disciples of long standing with whom we were to lodge.
Acts,21,17,When we arrived in Jerusalem the brethren received and welcomed us gladly.
Acts,21,18,On the next day Paul went in with us to [see] James and all the elders of the church were present [also].
Acts,21,19,After saluting them Paul gave a detailed account of the things God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.
Acts,21,20,And upon hearing it they adored and exalted and praised and thanked God. And they said to [Paul] You see brother how many thousands of believers there are among the Jews and all of them are enthusiastic upholders of the [Mosaic] Law.
Acts,21,21,Now they have been informed about you that you continually teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to turn back from and forsake Moses advising them not to circumcise their children or pay any attention to the observance of the [Mosaic] customs.
Acts,21,22,What then [is best that] should be done? A multitude will come together for they will surely hear that you have arrived.
Acts,21,23,Therefore do just what we tell you. With us are four men who have taken a vow upon themselves.
Acts,21,24,Take these men and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses [for the temple offering] so that they may have their heads shaved. Thus everybody will know that there is no truth in what they have been told about you but that you yourself walk in observance of the Law.
Acts,21,25,But with regard to the Gentiles who have believed (adhered to trusted in and relied on Christ) we have sent them a letter with our decision that they should keep themselves free from anything that has been sacrificed to idols and from [tasting] blood and [eating the meat of animals] which have been strangled and from all impurity and sexual immorality.
Acts,21,26,Then Paul took the [four] men with him and the following day [he went through the rites of] purifying himself along with them. And they entered the temple to give notice when the days of purification (the ending of each vow) would be fulfilled and the usual offering could be presented on behalf of each of them.
Acts,21,27,When the seven days were drawing to a close some of the Jews from [the province of] Asia who had caught sight of Paul in the temple incited all the rabble and laid hands on him
Acts,21,28,Shouting Men of Israel help! [Help!] This is the man who is teaching everybody everywhere against the people and the Law and this place! Moreover he has also [actually] brought Greeks into the temple; he has desecrated and polluted this holy place!
Acts,21,29,For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul and they supposed that he had brought the man into the temple [into the inner court forbidden to Gentiles].
Acts,21,30,Then the whole city was aroused and thrown into confusion and the people rushed together; they laid hands on Paul and dragged him outside the temple and immediately the gates were closed.
Acts,21,31,Now while they were trying to kill him word came to the commandant of the regular Roman garrison that the whole of Jerusalem was in a state of ferment.
Acts,21,32,So immediately he took soldiers and centurions and hurried down among them; and when the people saw the commandant and the troops they stopped beating Paul.
Acts,21,33,Then the commandant approached and arrested Paul and ordered that he be secured with two chains. He then inquired who he was and what he had done.
Acts,21,34,Some in the crowd kept shouting back one thing and others something else and since he could not ascertain the facts because of the furor he ordered that Paul be removed to the barracks.
Acts,21,35,And when [Paul] came to mount the steps he was actually being carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob;
Acts,21,36,For the mass of the people kept following them shouting Away with him! [Kill him!]
Acts,21,37,Just as Paul was about to be taken into the barracks he asked the commandant May I say something to you? And the man replied Can you speak Greek?
Acts,21,38,Are you not then [as I supposed] the Egyptian who not long ago stirred up a rebellion and led those 4000 men who were cutthroats out into the wilderness (desert)?
Acts,21,39,Paul answered I am a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia a citizen of no insignificant or undistinguished city. I beg you allow me to address the people.
Acts,21,40,And when the man had granted him permission Paul standing on the steps gestured with his hand to the people; and there was a great hush. Then he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect saying:
Acts,22,1,BRETHREN AND fathers listen to the defense which I now make in your presence.
Acts,22,2,And when they heard that he addressed them in the Hebrew tongue they were all the more quiet. And he continued
Acts,22,3,I am a Jew born in Tarsus of Cilicia but reared in this city. At the feet of Gamaliel I was educated according to the strictest care in the Law of our fathers being ardent [even a zealot] for God as all of you are today.
Acts,22,4,[Yes] I harassed (troubled molested and persecuted) this Way [of the Lord] to the death putting in chains and committing to prison both men and women
Acts,22,5,As the high priest and whole council of elders (Sanhedrin) can testify; for from them indeed I received letters with which I was on my way to the brethren in Damascus in order to take also those [believers] who were there and bring them in chains to Jerusalem that they might be punished.
Acts,22,6,But as I was on my journey and approached Damascus about noon a great blaze of light flashed suddenly from heaven and shone about me.
Acts,22,7,And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me Saul Saul why do you persecute Me [harass and trouble and molest Me]?
Acts,22,8,And I replied Who are You Lord? And He said to me I am Jesus the Nazarene Whom you are persecuting.
Acts,22,9,Now the men who were with me saw the light but they did not hear [ the sound of the uttered words of] the voice of the One Who was speaking to me [so that they could understand it].
Acts,22,10,And I asked What shall I do Lord? And the Lord answered me Get up and go into Damascus and there it will be told you all that it is destined and appointed for you to do.
Acts,22,11,And since I could not see because [of the dazzlingly glorious intensity] of the brightness of that light I was led by the hand by those who were with me and [thus] I arrived in Damascus.
Acts,22,12,And one Ananias a devout man according to the Law well spoken of by all the Jews who resided there
Acts,22,13,Came to see me and standing by my side said to me Brother Saul look up and receive back your sight. And in that very instant I [recovered my sight and] looking up saw him.
Acts,22,14,And he said The God of our forefathers has destined and appointed you to come progressively to know His will [to perceive to recognize more strongly and clearly and to become better and more intimately acquainted with His will] and to see the Righteous One (Jesus Christ the Messiah) and to hear a voice from His [own] mouth and a message from His [own] lips;
Acts,22,15,For you will be His witness unto all men of everything that you have seen and heard.
Acts,22,16,And now why do you delay? Rise and be baptized and by calling upon His name wash away your sins.
Acts,22,17,Then when I had come back to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple [ enclosure] I fell into a trance (an ecstasy);
Acts,22,18,And I saw Him as He said to me Hurry get quickly out of Jerusalem because they will not receive your testimony about Me.
Acts,22,19,And I said Lord they themselves well know that throughout all the synagogues I cast into prison and flogged those who believed on (adhered to and trusted in and relied on) You.
Acts,22,20,And when the blood of Your witness (martyr) Stephen was shed I also was personally standing by and consenting and approving and guarding the garments of those who slew him.
Acts,22,21,And the Lord said to me Go for I will send you far away unto the Gentiles (nations).
Acts,22,22,Up to the moment that Paul made this last statement the people listened to him; but now they raised their voices and shouted Away with such a fellow from the earth! He is not fit to live!
Acts,22,23,And as they were shouting and tossing and waving their garments and throwing dust into the air
Acts,22,24,The commandant ordered that Paul be brought into the barracks and that he be examined by scourging in order that [the commandant] might learn why the people cried out thus against him.
Acts,22,25,But when they had stretched him out with the thongs (leather straps) Paul asked the centurion who was standing by Is it legal for you to flog a man who is a Roman citizen and uncondemned [without a trial]?
Acts,22,26,When the centurion heard that he went to the commandant and said to him What are you about to do? This man is a Roman citizen!
Acts,22,27,So the commandant came and said to [Paul] Tell me are you a Roman citizen? And he said Yes [indeed]!
Acts,22,28,The commandant replied I purchased this citizenship [as a capital investment] for a big price. Paul said But I was born [Roman]!
Acts,22,29,Instantly those who were about to examine and flog him withdrew from him; and the commandant also was frightened for he realized that [Paul] was a Roman citizen and he had put him in chains.
Acts,22,30,But the next day desiring to know the real cause for which the Jews accused him he unbound him and ordered the chief priests and all the council (Sanhedrin) to assemble; and he brought Paul down and placed him before them.
Acts,23,1,THEN PAUL gazing earnestly at the council (Sanhedrin) said Brethren I have lived before God doing my duty with a perfectly good conscience until this very day [ as a citizen a true and loyal Jew].
Acts,23,2,At this the high priest Ananias ordered those who stood near him to strike him on the mouth.
Acts,23,3,Then Paul said to him God is about to strike you you whitewashed wall! Do you sit as a judge to try me in accordance with the Law and yet in defiance of the Law you order me to be struck?
Acts,23,4,Those who stood near exclaimed Do you rail at and insult the high priest of God?
Acts,23,5,And Paul said I was not conscious brethren that he was a high priest; for the Scripture says You shall not speak ill of a ruler of your people.
Acts,23,6,But Paul when he perceived that one part of them were Sadducees and the other part Pharisees cried out to the council (Sanhedrin) Brethren I am a Pharisee a son of Pharisees; it is with regard to the hope and the resurrection of the dead that I am indicted and being judged.
Acts,23,7,So when he had said this an angry dispute arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the whole [crowded] assemblage was divided [into two factions].
Acts,23,8,For the Sadducees hold that there is no resurrection nor angel nor spirit but the Pharisees declare openly and speak out freely acknowledging [their belief in] them both.
Acts,23,9,Then a great uproar ensued and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' party stood up and thoroughly fought the case [contending fiercely] and declaring We find nothing evil or wrong in this man. But if a spirit or an angel [really] spoke to him--? Let us not fight against God!
Acts,23,10,And when the strife became more and more tense and violent the commandant fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them ordered the troops to go down and take him forcibly from among them and conduct him back into the barracks.
Acts,23,11,And [that same] following night the Lord stood beside Paul and said Take courage Paul for as you have borne faithful witness concerning Me at Jerusalem so you must also bear witness at Rome.
Acts,23,12,Now when daylight came the Jews formed a plot and bound themselves by an oath and under a curse neither to eat nor drink till they had done away with Paul.
Acts,23,13,There were more than forty [men of them] who formed this conspiracy [swearing together this oath and curse].
Acts,23,14,And they went to the chief priests and elders saying We have strictly bound ourselves by an oath and under a curse not to taste any food until we have slain Paul.
Acts,23,15,So now you along with the council (Sanhedrin) give notice to the commandant to bring [Paul] down to you as if you were going to investigate his case more accurately. But we [ourselves] are ready to slay him before he comes near.
Acts,23,16,But the son of Paul's sister heard of their intended attack and he went and got into the barracks and told Paul.
Acts,23,17,Then Paul calling in one of the centurions said Take this young man to the commandant for he has something to report to him.
Acts,23,18,So he took him and conducted him to the commandant and said Paul the prisoner called me to him and requested me to conduct this young man to you for he has something to report to you.
Acts,23,19,The commandant took him by the hand and going aside with him asked privately What is it that you have to report to me?
Acts,23,20,And he replied The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council (Sanhedrin) tomorrow as if [they were] intending to examine him more exactly.
Acts,23,21,But do not yield to their persuasion for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush waiting for him having bound themselves by an oath and under a curse neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him; and even now they are all ready [just] waiting for your promise.
Acts,23,22,So the commandant sent the youth away charging him Do not disclose to anyone that you have given me this information.
Acts,23,23,Then summoning two of the centurions he said Have two hundred footmen ready by the third hour of the night (about 9:00 p.m.) to go as far as Caesarea with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen.
Acts,23,24,Also provide beasts for mounts for Paul to ride and bring him in safety to Felix the governor.
Acts,23,25,And he wrote a letter having this message:
Acts,23,26,Claudius Lysias sends greetings to His Excellency Felix the governor.
Acts,23,27,This man was seized [as prisoner] by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I came upon them with the troops and rescued him because I learned that he is a Roman citizen.
Acts,23,28,And wishing to know the exact accusation which they were making against him I brought him down before their council (Sanhedrin)
Acts,23,29,[Where] I found that he was charged in regard to questions of their own law but he was accused of nothing that would call for death or [even] for imprisonment.
Acts,23,30,[However] when it was pointed out to me that there would be a conspiracy against the man I sent him to you immediately directing his accusers also to present before you their charge against him.
Acts,23,31,So the soldiers in compliance with their instructions took Paul and conducted him during the night to Antipatris.
Acts,23,32,And the next day they returned to the barracks leaving the mounted men to proceed with him.
Acts,23,33,When these came to Caesarea and gave the letter to the governor they also presented Paul before him.
Acts,23,34,Having read the letter he asked to what province [Paul] belonged. When he discovered that he was from Cilicia [an imperial province]
Acts,23,35,He said I will hear your case fully when your accusers also have come. And he ordered that an eye be kept on him in Herod's palace (the Praetorium).
Acts,24,1,FIVE DAYS later the high priest Ananias came down [from Jerusalem to Caesarea] with some elders and a certain forensic advocate Tertullus [acting as spokesman and counsel]. They presented to the governor their evidence against Paul.
Acts,24,2,And when he was called Tertullus began the complaint [against him] by saying: Since through you we obtain and enjoy much peace and since by your foresight and provision wonderful reforms (amendments and improvements) are introduced and effected on behalf of this nation
Acts,24,3,In every way and in every place most excellent Felix we accept and acknowledge this with deep appreciation and with all gratitude.
Acts,24,4,But not to hinder or detain you too long I beg you in your clemency and courtesy and kindness to grant us a brief and concise hearing.
Acts,24,5,For we have found this man a perfect pest (a real plague) an agitator and source of disturbance to all the Jews throughout the world and a ringleader of the [heretical division-producing] sect of the Nazarenes.
Acts,24,6,He also [even] tried to desecrate and defile the temple but we laid hands on him and would have sentenced him by our Law
Acts,24,7,But the commandant Lysias came and took him from us with violence and force
Acts,24,8,And ordered his accusers to present themselves to you. By examining and cross-questioning him yourself you will be able to ascertain the truth from him about all these things with which we charge him.
Acts,24,9,The Jews also agreed and joined in the accusation declaring that all these things were exactly so.
Acts,24,10,And when the governor had beckoned to Paul to speak he answered: Because I know that for many years you have been a judge over this nation I find it easier to make my defense and do it cheerfully and with good courage.
Acts,24,11,As you can readily verify it is not more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship;
Acts,24,12,And neither in the temple nor in the synagogues nor in the city did they find me disputing with anybody or bringing together a seditious crowd.
Acts,24,13,Neither can they present argument or evidence to prove to you what they now bring against me.
Acts,24,14,But this I confess to you however that in accordance with the Way [of the Lord] which they call a [heretical division-producing] sect I worship (serve) the God of our fathers still persuaded of the truth of and believing in and placing full confidence in everything laid down in the Law [of Moses] or written in the prophets;
Acts,24,15,Having [the same] hope in God which these themselves hold and look for that there is to be a resurrection both of the righteous and the unrighteous (the just and the unjust).
Acts,24,16,Therefore I always exercise and discipline myself [mortifying my body deadening my carnal affections bodily appetites and worldly desires endeavoring in all respects] to have a clear (unshaken blameless) conscience void of offense toward God and toward men.
Acts,24,17,Now after several years I came up [to Jerusalem] to bring to my people contributions of charity and offerings.
Acts,24,18,While I was engaged in presenting these they found me [occupied in the rites of purification] in the temple without any crowd or uproar. But some Jews from [the province of] Asia [were there]
Acts,24,19,Who ought to be here before you and to present their charges if they have anything against me.
Acts,24,20,Or else let these men themselves tell of what crime or wrongdoing they found me guilty when I appeared before the council (Sanhedrin)
Acts,24,21,Unless it be this one sentence which I cried out as I stood among them In regard to the resurrection of the dead I am indicted and on trial before you this day!
Acts,24,22,But Felix having a rather accurate understanding of the Way [of the Lord] put them off and adjourned the trial saying When Lysias the commandant comes down I will determine your case more fully.
Acts,24,23,Then he ordered the centurion to keep [Paul] in custody but to treat him with indulgence [giving him some liberty] and not to hinder his friends from ministering to his needs and serving him.
Acts,24,24,Some days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla who was a Jewess; and he sent for Paul and listened to him [talk] about faith in Christ Jesus.
Acts,24,25,But as he continued to argue about uprightness purity of life (the control of the passions) and the judgment to come Felix became alarmed and terrified and said Go away for the present; when I have a convenient opportunity I will send for you.
Acts,24,26,At the same time he hoped to get money from Paul for which reason he continued to send for him and was in his company and conversed with him often.
Acts,24,27,But when two years had gone by Felix was succeeded in office by Porcius Festus; and wishing to gain favor with the Jews Felix left Paul still a prisoner in chains.
Acts,25,1,NOW WHEN Festus had entered into his own province after three days he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem.
Acts,25,2,And [there] the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews laid charges before him against Paul and they kept begging and urging him
Acts,25,3,Asking as a favor that he would have him brought to Jerusalem; [meanwhile] they were planning an ambush to slay him on the way.
Acts,25,4,Festus answered that Paul was in custody in Caesarea and that he himself planned to leave for there soon.
Acts,25,5,So said he let those who are in a position of authority and are influential among you go down with me and if there is anything amiss or criminal about the man let them so charge him.
Acts,25,6,So when Festus had remained among them not more than eight or ten days he went down to Caesarea took his seat the next day on the judgment bench and ordered Paul to be brought before him.
Acts,25,7,And when he arrived the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood all around him bringing many grave accusations against him which they were not able to prove.
Acts,25,8,Paul declared in [his own] defense Neither against the Law of the Jews nor against the temple nor against Caesar have I offended in any way.
Acts,25,9,But Festus wishing to ingratiate himself with the Jews answered Paul Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and there be put on trial [ before the Jewish Sanhedrin] in my presence concerning these charges?
Acts,25,10,But Paul replied I am standing before Caesar's judgment seat where I ought to be tried. To the Jews I have done no wrong as you know better [than your question implies].
Acts,25,11,If then I am a wrongdoer and a criminal and have committed anything for which I deserve to die I do not beg off and seek to escape death; but if there is no ground for their accusations against me no one can give me up and make a present of me [ give me up freely] to them. I appeal to Caesar.
Acts,25,12,Then Festus when he had consulted with the [ men who formed his] council answered You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you shall go.
Acts,25,13,Now after an interval of some days Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus [to welcome him and wish him well].
Acts,25,14,And while they remained there for many days Festus acquainted the king with Paul's case telling him There is a man left a prisoner in chains by Felix;
Acts,25,15,And when I was at Jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me about him petitioning for a judicial hearing and condemnation of him.
Acts,25,16,But I replied to them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up freely any man for punishment before the accused had met the accusers face to face and had opportunity to defend himself concerning the charge brought against him.
Acts,25,17,So when they came here together I did not delay but on the morrow took my place on the judgment seat and ordered that the man be brought before me.
Acts,25,18,[But] when the accusers stood up they brought forward no accusation [in his case] of any such misconduct as I was expecting.
Acts,25,19,Instead they had some points of controversy with him about their own religion or superstition and concerning one Jesus Who had died but Whom Paul kept asserting [over and over] to be alive.
Acts,25,20,And I being puzzled to know how to make inquiries into such questions asked whether he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and there be tried regarding them.
Acts,25,21,But when Paul had appealed to have his case retained for examination and decision by the emperor I ordered that he be detained until I could send him to Caesar.
Acts,25,22,Then Agrippa said to Festus I also desire to hear the man myself. Tomorrow [Festus] replied you shall hear him.
Acts,25,23,So the next day Agrippa and Bernice approached with great display and they went into the audience hall accompanied by the military commandants and the prominent citizens of the city. At the order of Festus Paul was brought in.
Acts,25,24,Then Festus said King Agrippa and all the men present with us you see this man about whom the whole Jewish people came to me and complained both at Jerusalem and here insisting and shouting that he ought not to live any longer.
Acts,25,25,But I found nothing that he had done deserving of death. Still as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined to send him to Rome.
Acts,25,26,[However] I have nothing in particular and definite to write to my lord concerning him. So I have brought him before all of you and especially before you King Agrippa so that after [further] examination has been made I may have something to put in writing.
Acts,25,27,For it seems to me senseless and absurd to send a prisoner and not state the accusations against him.
Acts,26,1,THEN AGRIPPA said to Paul You are permitted to speak on your own behalf. At that Paul stretched forth his hand and made his defense [as follows]:
Acts,26,2,I consider myself fortunate King Agrippa that it is before you that I am to make my defense today in regard to all the charges brought against me by [the] Jews
Acts,26,3,[Especially] because you are so fully and unusually conversant with all the Jewish customs and controversies; therefore I beg you to hear me patiently.
Acts,26,4,My behavior and manner of living from my youth up is known by all the Jews; [they are aware] that from [its] commencement my youth was spent among my own race in Jerusalem.
Acts,26,5,They have had knowledge of me for a long time if they are willing to testify to it that in accordance with the strictest sect of our religion I have lived as a Pharisee.
Acts,26,6,And now I stand here on trial [to be judged on the ground] of the hope of that promise made to our forefathers by God
Acts,26,7,Which hope [of the Messiah and the resurrection] our twelve tribes confidently expect to realize as they fervently worship [without ceasing] night and day. And for that hope O king I am accused by Jews and considered a criminal!
Acts,26,8,Why is it thought incredible by any of you that God raises the dead?
Acts,26,9,I myself indeed was [once] persuaded that it was my duty to do many things contrary to and in defiance of the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
Acts,26,10,And that is what I did in Jerusalem; I [not only] locked up many of the [faithful] saints (holy ones) in prison by virtue of authority received from the chief priests but when they were being condemned to death I cast my vote against them.
Acts,26,11,And frequently I punished them in all the synagogues to make them blaspheme; and in my bitter fury against them I harassed (troubled molested persecuted) and pursued them even to foreign cities.
Acts,26,12,Thus engaged I proceeded to Damascus with the authority and orders of the chief priests
Acts,26,13,When on the road at midday O king I saw a light from heaven surpassing the brightness of the sun flashing about me and those who were traveling with me.
Acts,26,14,And when we had all fallen to the ground I heard a voice in the Hebrew tongue saying to me Saul Saul why do you continue to persecute Me [to harass and trouble and molest Me]? It is dangerous and turns out badly for you to keep kicking against the goads [to keep offering vain and perilous resistance].
Acts,26,15,And I said Who are You Lord? And the Lord said I am Jesus Whom you are persecuting.
Acts,26,16,But arise and stand upon your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose that I might appoint you to serve as [My] minister and to bear witness both to what you have seen of Me and to that in which I will appear to you
Acts,26,17,Choosing you out [selecting you for Myself] and delivering you from among this [Jewish] people and the Gentiles to whom I am sending you--
Acts,26,18,To open their eyes that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God so that they may thus receive forgiveness and release from their sins and a place and portion among those who are consecrated and purified by faith in Me.
Acts,26,19,Wherefore O King Agrippa I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision
Acts,26,20,But made known openly first of all to those at Damascus then at Jerusalem and throughout the whole land of Judea and also among the Gentiles that they should repent and turn to God and do works and live lives consistent with and worthy of their repentance.
Acts,26,21,Because of these things the Jews seized me in the temple [ enclosure] and tried to do away with me.
Acts,26,22,[But] to this day I have had the help which comes from God [as my ally] and so I stand here testifying to small and great alike asserting nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses declared would come to pass--
Acts,26,23,That the Christ (the Anointed One) must suffer and that He by being the first to rise from the dead would declare and show light both to the [Jewish] people and to the Gentiles.
Acts,26,24,And as he thus proceeded with his defense Festus called out loudly Paul you are mad! Your great learning is driving you insane!
Acts,26,25,But Paul replied I am not mad most noble Festus but I am uttering the straight sound truth.
Acts,26,26,For the king understands about these things well enough and [therefore] to him I speak with bold frankness and confidence. I am convinced that not one of these things has escaped his notice for all this did not take place in a corner [in secret].
Acts,26,27,King Agrippa do you believe the prophets? [Do you give credence to God's messengers and their words?] I perceive and know that you do believe.
Acts,26,28,Then Agrippa said to Paul You think it a small task to make a Christian of me [just offhand to induce me with little ado and persuasion at very short notice].
Acts,26,29,And Paul replied Whether short or long I would to God that not only you but also all who are listening to me today might become such as I am except for these chains.
Acts,26,30,Then the king arose and the governor and Bernice and all those who were seated with them;
Acts,26,31,And after they had gone out they said to one another This man is doing nothing deserving of death or [even] of imprisonment.
Acts,26,32,And Agrippa said to Festus This man could have been set at liberty if he had not appealed to Caesar.
Acts,27,1,NOW WHEN it was determined that we [including Luke] should sail for Italy they turned Paul and some other prisoners over to a centurion of the imperial regiment named Julius.
Acts,27,2,And going aboard a ship from Adramyttium which was about to sail for the ports along the coast of [the province of] Asia we put out to sea; and Aristarchus a Macedonian from Thessalonica accompanied us.
Acts,27,3,The following day we landed at Sidon and Julius treated Paul in a loving way with much consideration (kindness and care) permitting him to go to his friends [there] and be refreshed and be cared for.
Acts,27,4,After putting to sea from there we passed to the leeward (south side) of Cyprus [for protection] for the winds were contrary to us.
Acts,27,5,And when we had sailed over [the whole length] of sea which lies off Cilicia and Pamphylia we reached Myra in Lycia.
Acts,27,6,There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy and he transferred us to it.
Acts,27,7,For a number of days we made slow progress and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus; then as the wind did not permit us to proceed we went under the lee (shelter) of Crete off Salmone
Acts,27,8,And coasting along it with difficulty we arrived at a place called Fair Havens near which is located the town of Lasea.
Acts,27,9,But as [the season was well advanced for] much time had been lost and navigation was already dangerous for the time for the Fast [the Day of Atonement about the beginning of October] had already gone by Paul warned and advised them
Acts,27,10,Saying Sirs I perceive [after careful observation] that this voyage will be attended with disaster and much heavy loss not only of the cargo and the ship but of our lives also.
Acts,27,11,However the centurion paid greater attention to the pilot and to the owner of the ship than to what Paul said.
Acts,27,12,And as the harbor was not well situated and so unsuitable to winter in the majority favored the plan of putting to sea again from there hoping somehow to reach Phoenice a harbor of Crete facing southwest and northwest and winter there.
Acts,27,13,So when the south wind blew softly supposing they were gaining their object they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete hugging the coast.
Acts,27,14,But soon afterward a violent wind [of the character of a typhoon] called a northeaster came bursting down from the island.
Acts,27,15,And when the ship was caught and was unable to head against the wind we gave up and letting her drift were borne along.
Acts,27,16,We ran under the shelter of a small island called Cauda where we managed with [much] difficulty to draw the [ship's small] boat on deck and secure it.
Acts,27,17,After hoisting it on board they used supports with ropes to undergird and brace the ship; then afraid that they would be driven into the Syrtis [quicksands off the north coast of Africa] they lowered the gear (sails and ropes) and so were driven along.
Acts,27,18,As we were being dangerously tossed about by the violence of the storm the next day they began to throw the freight overboard;
Acts,27,19,And the third day they threw out with their own hands the ship's equipment (the tackle and the furniture).
Acts,27,20,And when neither sun nor stars were visible for many days and no small tempest kept raging about us all hope of our being saved was finally abandoned.
Acts,27,21,Then as they had eaten nothing for a long time Paul came forward into their midst and said Men you should have listened to me and should not have put to sea from Crete and brought on this disaster and harm and misery and loss.
Acts,27,22,But [even] now I beg you to be in good spirits and take heart for there will be no loss of life among you but only of the ship.
Acts,27,23,For this [very] night there stood by my side an angel of the God to Whom I belong and Whom I serve and worship
Acts,27,24,And he said Do not be frightened Paul! It is necessary for you to stand before Caesar; and behold God has given you all those who are sailing with you.
Acts,27,25,So keep up your courage men for I have faith (complete confidence) in God that it will be exactly as it was told me;
Acts,27,26,But we shall have to be stranded on some island.
Acts,27,27,The fourteenth night had come and we were drifting and being driven about in the Adriatic Sea when about midnight the sailors began to suspect that they were drawing near to some land.
Acts,27,28,So they took soundings and found twenty fathoms and a little farther on they sounded again and found fifteen fathoms.
Acts,27,29,Then fearing that we might fall off [our course] onto rocks they dropped four anchors from the stern and kept wishing for daybreak to come.
Acts,27,30,And as the sailors were trying to escape [secretly] from the ship and were lowering the small boat into the sea pretending that they were going to lay out anchors from the bow
Acts,27,31,Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers Unless these men remain in the ship you cannot be saved.
Acts,27,32,Then the soldiers cut away the ropes that held the small boat and let it fall and drift away.
Acts,27,33,While they waited until it should become day Paul entreated them all to take some food saying This is the fourteenth day that you have been continually in suspense and on the alert without food having eaten nothing.
Acts,27,34,So I urge (warn exhort encourage advise) you to take some food [for your safety]--it will give you strength; for not a hair is to perish from the head of any one of you.
Acts,27,35,Having said these words he took bread and giving thanks to God before them all he broke it and began to eat.
Acts,27,36,Then they all became more cheerful and were encouraged and took food themselves.
Acts,27,37,All told there were 276 souls of us in the ship.
Acts,27,38,And after they had eaten sufficiently [they proceeded] to lighten the ship throwing out the wheat into the sea.
Acts,27,39,Now when it was day [and they saw the land] they did not recognize it but they noticed a bay with a beach on which they [taking counsel] purposed to run the ship ashore if they possibly could.
Acts,27,40,So they cut the cables and severed the anchors and left them in the sea; at the same time unlashing the ropes that held the rudders and hoisting the foresail to the wind they headed for the beach.
Acts,27,41,But striking a crosscurrent (a place open to two seas) they ran the ship aground. The prow stuck fast and remained immovable and the stern began to break up under the violent force of the waves.
Acts,27,42,It was the counsel of the soldiers to kill the prisoners lest any of them should swim to land and escape;
Acts,27,43,But the centurion wishing to save Paul prevented their carrying out their purpose. He commanded those who could swim to throw themselves overboard first and make for the shore
Acts,27,44,And the rest on heavy boards or pieces of the vessel. And so it was that all escaped safely to land.
Acts,28,1,AFTER WE were safe on the island we knew and recognized that it was called Malta.
Acts,28,2,And the natives showed us unusual and remarkable kindness for they kindled a fire and welcomed and received us all since it had begun to rain and was cold.
Acts,28,3,Now Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and he was laying them on the fire when a viper crawled out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand.
Acts,28,4,When the natives saw the little animal hanging from his hand they said to one another Doubtless this man is a murderer for though he has been saved from the sea Justice [ the goddess of avenging] has not permitted that he should live.
Acts,28,5,Then [Paul simply] shook off the small creature into the fire and suffered no evil effects.
Acts,28,6,However they were waiting expecting him to swell up or suddenly drop dead; but when they had watched him a long time and saw nothing fatal or harmful come to him they changed their minds and kept saying over and over that he was a god.
Acts,28,7,In the vicinity of that place there were estates belonging to the head man of the island named Publius who accepted and welcomed and entertained us with hearty hospitality for three days.
Acts,28,8,And it happened that the father of Publius was sick in bed with recurring attacks of fever and dysentery; and Paul went to see him and after praying and laying his hands on him he healed him.
Acts,28,9,After this had occurred the other people on the island who had diseases also kept coming and were cured.
Acts,28,10,They showed us every respect and presented many gifts to us honoring us with many honors; and when we sailed they provided and put on [board our ship] everything we needed.
Acts,28,11,It was after three months' stay there that we set sail in a ship which had wintered in the island an Alexandrian ship with the Twin Brothers [Castor and Pollux] as its figurehead.
Acts,28,12,We landed at Syracuse and remained there three days
Acts,28,13,And from there we made a circuit [following the coast] and reached Rhegium; and one day later a south wind sprang up and the next day we arrived at Puteoli.
Acts,28,14,There we found some [Christian] brethren and were entreated to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome.
Acts,28,15,And the [Christian] brethren there having had news of us came as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. When Paul saw them he thanked God and received new courage.
Acts,28,16,When we arrived at Rome the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard but Paul was permitted to live by himself with the soldier who guarded him.
Acts,28,17,Three days after [our arrival] he called together the leading local Jews; and when they had gathered he said to them Brethren though I have done nothing against the people or against the customs of our forefathers yet I was turned over as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
Acts,28,18,After they had examined me they were ready to release me because I was innocent of any offense deserving the death penalty.
Acts,28,19,But when the Jews protested I was forced to appeal to Caesar though it was not because I had any charge to make against my nation.
Acts,28,20,This is the reason therefore why I have begged to see you and to talk with you since it is because of the Hope of Israel (the Messiah) that I am bound with this chain.
Acts,28,21,And they answered him We have not received any letters about you from Judea and none of the [Jewish] brethren coming here has reported or spoken anything evil about you.
Acts,28,22,But we think it fitting and are eager to hear from you what it is that you have in mind and believe and what your opinion is for with regard to this sect it is known to all of us that it is everywhere denounced.
Acts,28,23,So when they had set a day with him they came in large numbers to his lodging. And he fully set forth and explained the matter to them from morning until night testifying to the kingdom of God and trying to persuade them concerning Jesus both from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets.
Acts,28,24,And some were convinced and believed what he said and others did not believe.
Acts,28,25,And as they disagreed among themselves they began to leave [but not before] Paul had added one statement [more]: The Holy Spirit was right in saying through Isaiah the prophet to your forefathers:
Acts,28,26,Go to this people and say to them You will indeed hear and hear with your ears but will not understand and you will indeed look and look with your eyes but will not see [not perceive have knowledge of or become acquainted with what you look at at all].
Acts,28,27,For the heart (the understanding the soul) of this people has grown dull (stupid hardened and calloused) and their ears are heavy and hard of hearing and they have shut tight their eyes so that they may not perceive and have knowledge and become acquainted with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their souls and turn [to Me and be converted] that I may heal them.
Acts,28,28,So let it be understood by you then that [this message of] the salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles and they will listen [to it]!
Acts,28,29,And when he had said these things the Jews went away arguing and disputing among themselves.
Acts,28,30,After this Paul lived there for two entire years [at his own expense] in his own rented lodging and he welcomed all who came to him
Acts,28,31,Preaching to them the kingdom of God and teaching them about the Lord Jesus Christ with boldness and quite openly and without being molested or hindered.
Romans,1,1,FROM PAUL a bond servant of Jesus Christ (the Messiah) called to be an apostle (a special messenger) set apart to [preach] the Gospel (good news) of and from God
Romans,1,2,Which He promised in advance [long ago] through His prophets in the sacred Scriptures--
Romans,1,3,[The Gospel] regarding His Son Who as to the flesh (His human nature) was descended from David
Romans,1,4,And [as to His divine nature] according to the Spirit of holiness was openly designated the Son of God in power [in a striking triumphant and miraculous manner] by His resurrection from the dead even Jesus Christ our Lord (the Messiah the Anointed One).
Romans,1,5,It is through Him that we have received grace (God's unmerited favor) and [our] apostleship to promote obedience to the faith and make disciples for His name's sake among all the nations
Romans,1,6,And this includes you called of Jesus Christ and invited [as you are] to belong to Him.
Romans,1,7,To [you then] all God's beloved ones in Rome called to be saints and designated for a consecrated life: Grace and spiritual blessing and peace be yours from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans,1,8,First I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you because [the report of] your faith is made known to all the world and is commended everywhere.
Romans,1,9,For God is my witness Whom I serve with my [whole] spirit [rendering priestly and spiritual service] in [preaching] the Gospel and [telling] the good news of His Son how incessantly I always mention you when at my prayers.
Romans,1,10,I keep pleading that somehow by God's will I may now at last prosper and come to you.
Romans,1,11,For I am yearning to see you that I may impart and share with you some spiritual gift to strengthen and establish you;
Romans,1,12,That is that we may be mutually strengthened and encouraged and comforted by each other's faith both yours and mine.
Romans,1,13,I want you to know brethren that many times I have planned and intended to come to you though thus far I have been hindered and prevented in order that I might have some fruit (some result of my labors) among you as I have among the rest of the Gentiles.
Romans,1,14,Both to Greeks and to barbarians (to the cultured and to the uncultured) both to the wise and the foolish I have an obligation to discharge and a duty to perform and a debt to pay.
Romans,1,15,So for my part I am willing and eagerly ready to preach the Gospel to you also who are in Rome.
Romans,1,16,For I am not ashamed of the Gospel (good news) of Christ for it is God's power working unto salvation [for deliverance from eternal death] to everyone who believes with a personal trust and a confident surrender and firm reliance to the Jew first and also to the Greek
Romans,1,17,For in the Gospel a righteousness which God ascribes is revealed both springing from faith and leading to faith [disclosed through the way of faith that arouses to more faith]. As it is written The man who through faith is just and upright shall live and shall live by faith.
Romans,1,18,For God's [holy] wrath and indignation are revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who in their wickedness repress and hinder the truth and make it inoperative.
Romans,1,19,For that which is known about God is evident to them and made plain in their inner consciousness because God [Himself] has shown it to them.
Romans,1,20,For ever since the creation of the world His invisible nature and attributes that is His eternal power and divinity have been made intelligible and clearly discernible in and through the things that have been made (His handiworks). So [men] are without excuse [altogether without any defense or justification]
Romans,1,21,Because when they knew and recognized Him as God they did not honor and glorify Him as God or give Him thanks. But instead they became futile and godless in their thinking [with vain imaginings foolish reasoning and stupid speculations] and their senseless minds were darkened.
Romans,1,22,Claiming to be wise they became fools [professing to be smart they made simpletons of themselves].
Romans,1,23,And by them the glory and majesty and excellence of the immortal God were exchanged for and represented by images resembling mortal man and birds and beasts and reptiles.
Romans,1,24,Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their [own] hearts to sexual impurity to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves [abandoning them to the degrading power of sin]
Romans,1,25,Because they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator Who is blessed forever! Amen (so be it).
Romans,1,26,For this reason God gave them over and abandoned them to vile affections and degrading passions. For their women exchanged their natural function for an unnatural and abnormal one
Romans,1,27,And the men also turned from natural relations with women and were set ablaze (burning out consumed) with lust for one another--men committing shameful acts with men and suffering in their own bodies and personalities the inevitable consequences and penalty of their wrong-doing and going astray which was [their] fitting retribution.
Romans,1,28,And so since they did not see fit to acknowledge God or approve of Him or consider Him worth the knowing God gave them over to a base and condemned mind to do things not proper or decent but loathsome
Romans,1,29,Until they were filled (permeated and saturated) with every kind of unrighteousness iniquity grasping and covetous greed and malice. [They were] full of envy and jealousy murder strife deceit and treachery ill will and cruel ways. [They were] secret backbiters and gossipers
Romans,1,30,Slanderers hateful to and hating God full of insolence arrogance [and] boasting; inventors of new forms of evil disobedient and undutiful to parents.
Romans,1,31,[They were] without understanding conscienceless and faithless heartless and loveless [and] merciless.
Romans,1,32,Though they are fully aware of God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve to die they not only do them themselves but approve and applaud others who practice them.
Romans,2,1,THEREFORE YOU have no excuse or defense or justification O man whoever you are who judges and condemns another. For in posing as judge and passing sentence on another you condemn yourself because you who judge are habitually practicing the very same things [that you censure and denounce].
Romans,2,2,[But] we know that the judgment (adverse verdict sentence) of God falls justly and in accordance with truth upon those who practice such things.
Romans,2,3,And do you think or imagine O man when you judge and condemn those who practice such things and yet do them yourself that you will escape God's judgment and elude His sentence and adverse verdict?
Romans,2,4,Or are you [so blind as to] trifle with and presume upon and despise and underestimate the wealth of His kindness and forbearance and long-suffering patience? Are you unmindful or actually ignorant [of the fact] that God's kindness is intended to lead you to repent ( to change your mind and inner man to accept God's will)?
Romans,2,5,But by your callous stubbornness and impenitence of heart you are storing up wrath and indignation for yourself on the day of wrath and indignation when God's righteous judgment (just doom) will be revealed.
Romans,2,6,For He will render to every man according to his works [justly as his deeds deserve]:
Romans,2,7,To those who by patient persistence in well-doing [ springing from piety] seek [unseen but sure] glory and honor and [ the eternal blessedness of] immortality He will give eternal life.
Romans,2,8,But for those who are self-seeking and self-willed and disobedient to the Truth but responsive to wickedness there will be indignation and wrath.
Romans,2,9,[And] there will be tribulation and anguish and calamity and constraint for every soul of man who [habitually] does evil the Jew first and also the Greek (Gentile).
Romans,2,10,But glory and honor and [heart] peace shall be awarded to everyone who [habitually] does good the Jew first and also the Greek (Gentile).
Romans,2,11,For God shows no partiality [ undue favor or unfairness; with Him one man is not different from another].
Romans,2,12,All who have sinned without the Law will also perish without [regard to] the Law and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged and condemned by the Law.
Romans,2,13,For it is not merely hearing the Law [read] that makes one righteous before God but it is the doers of the Law who will be held guiltless and acquitted and justified.
Romans,2,14,When Gentiles who have not the [divine] Law do instinctively what the Law requires they are a law to themselves since they do not have the Law.
Romans,2,15,They show that the essential requirements of the Law are written in their hearts and are operating there with which their consciences (sense of right and wrong) also bear witness; and their [moral] decisions (their arguments of reason their condemning or approving thoughts) will accuse or perhaps defend and excuse [them]
Romans,2,16,On that day when as my Gospel proclaims God by Jesus Christ will judge men in regard to the things which they conceal (their hidden thoughts).
Romans,2,17,But if you bear the name of Jew and rely upon the Law and pride yourselves in God and your relationship to Him
Romans,2,18,And know and understand His will and discerningly approve the better things and have a sense of what is vital because you are instructed by the Law;
Romans,2,19,And if you are confident that you [yourself] are a guide to the blind a light to those who are in darkness and [that
Romans,2,20,You are] a corrector of the foolish a teacher of the childish having in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and truth--
Romans,2,21,Well then you who teach others do you not teach yourself? While you teach against stealing do you steal (take what does not really belong to you)?
Romans,2,22,You who say not to commit adultery do you commit adultery [are you unchaste in action or in thought]? You who abhor and loathe idols do you rob temples [do you appropriate to your own use what is consecrated to God thus robbing the sanctuary and doing sacrilege]?
Romans,2,23,You who boast in the Law do you dishonor God by breaking the Law [by stealthily infringing upon or carelessly neglecting or openly breaking it]?
Romans,2,24,For as it is written The name of God is maligned and blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you! [The words to this effect are from your own Scriptures.]
Romans,2,25,Circumcision does indeed profit if you keep the Law; but if you habitually transgress the Law your circumcision is made uncircumcision.
Romans,2,26,So if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the requirements of the Law will not his uncircumcision be credited to him as [equivalent to] circumcision?
Romans,2,27,Then those who are physically uncircumcised but keep the Law will condemn you who although you have the code in writing and have circumcision break the Law.
Romans,2,28,For he is not a [real] Jew who is only one outwardly and publicly nor is [true] circumcision something external and physical.
Romans,2,29,But he is a Jew who is one inwardly and [true] circumcision is of the heart a spiritual and not a literal [matter]. His praise is not from men but from God.
Romans,3,1,THEN WHAT advantage remains to the Jew? [How is he favored?] Or what is the value or benefit of circumcision?
Romans,3,2,Much in every way. To begin with to the Jews were entrusted the oracles (the brief communications the intentions the utterances) of God.
Romans,3,3,What if some did not believe and were without faith? Does their lack of faith and their faithlessness nullify and make ineffective and void the faithfulness of God and His fidelity [to His Word]?
Romans,3,4,By no means! Let God be found true though every human being is false and a liar as it is written That You may be justified and shown to be upright in what You say and prevail when You are judged [by sinful men].
Romans,3,5,But if our unrighteousness thus establishes and exhibits the righteousness of God what shall we say? That God is unjust and wrong to inflict His wrath upon us [Jews]? I speak in a [purely] human way.
Romans,3,6,By no means! Otherwise how could God judge the world?
Romans,3,7,But [you say] if through my falsehood God's integrity is magnified and advertised and abounds to His glory why am I still being judged as a sinner?
Romans,3,8,And why should we not do evil that good may come?--as some slanderously charge us with teaching. Such [false teaching] is justly condemned by them.
Romans,3,9,Well then are we [Jews] superior and better off than they? No not at all. We have already charged that all men both Jews and Greeks (Gentiles) are under sin [held down by and subject to its power and control].
Romans,3,10,As it is written None is righteous just and truthful and upright and conscientious no not one.
Romans,3,11,No one understands [no one intelligently discerns or comprehends]; no one seeks out God.
Romans,3,12,All have turned aside; together they have gone wrong and have become unprofitable and worthless; no one does right not even one!
Romans,3,13,Their throat is a yawning grave; they use their tongues to deceive (to mislead and to deal treacherously). The venom of asps is beneath their lips.
Romans,3,14,Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.
Romans,3,15,Their feet are swift to shed blood.
Romans,3,16,Destruction [as it dashes them to pieces] and misery mark their ways.
Romans,3,17,And they have no experience of the way of peace [they know nothing about peace for a peaceful way they do not even recognize].
Romans,3,18,There is no [reverential] fear of God before their eyes.
Romans,3,19,Now we know that whatever the Law says it speaks to those who are under the Law so that [the murmurs and excuses of] every mouth may be hushed and all the world may be held accountable to God.
Romans,3,20,For no person will be justified (made righteous acquitted and judged acceptable) in His sight by observing the works prescribed by the Law. For [the real function of] the Law is to make men recognize and be conscious of sin [ not mere perception but an acquaintance with sin which works toward repentance faith and holy character].
Romans,3,21,But now the righteousness of God has been revealed independently and altogether apart from the Law although actually it is attested by the Law and the Prophets
Romans,3,22,Namely the righteousness of God which comes by believing with personal trust and confident reliance on Jesus Christ (the Messiah). [And it is meant] for all who believe. For there is no distinction
Romans,3,23,Since all have sinned and are falling short of the honor and glory which God bestows and receives.
Romans,3,24,[All] are justified and made upright and in right standing with God freely and gratuitously by His grace (His unmerited favor and mercy) through the redemption which is [provided] in Christ Jesus
Romans,3,25,Whom God put forward [ before the eyes of all] as a mercy seat and propitiation by His blood [the cleansing and life-giving sacrifice of atonement and reconciliation to be received] through faith. This was to show God's righteousness because in His divine forbearance He had passed over and ignored former sins without punishment.
Romans,3,26,It was to demonstrate and prove at the present time ( in the now season) that He Himself is righteous and that He justifies and accepts as righteous him who has [true] faith in Jesus.
Romans,3,27,Then what becomes of [our] pride and [our] boasting? It is excluded (banished ruled out entirely). On what principle? [On the principle] of doing good deeds? No but on the principle of faith.
Romans,3,28,For we hold that a man is justified and made upright by faith independent of and distinctly apart from good deeds (works of the Law). [The observance of the Law has nothing to do with justification.]
Romans,3,29,Or is God merely [the God] of Jews? Is He not the God of Gentiles also? Yes of Gentiles also
Romans,3,30,Since it is one and the same God Who will justify the circumcised by faith [ which germinated from Abraham] and the uncircumcised through their [newly acquired] faith. [For it is the same trusting faith in both cases a firmly relying faith in Jesus Christ].
Romans,3,31,Do we then by [this] faith make the Law of no effect overthrow it or make it a dead letter? Certainly not! On the contrary we confirm and establish and uphold the Law.
Romans,4,1,[BUT] IF so what shall we say about Abraham our forefather humanly speaking--[what did he] find out? [How does this affect his position and what was gained by him?]
Romans,4,2,For if Abraham was justified ( established as just by acquittal from guilt) by good works [that he did then] he has grounds for boasting. But not before God!
Romans,4,3,For what does the Scripture say? Abraham believed in (trusted in) God and it was credited to his account as righteousness (right living and right standing with God).
Romans,4,4,Now to a laborer his wages are not counted as a favor or a gift but as an obligation (something owed to him).
Romans,4,5,But to one who not working [by the Law] trusts (believes fully) in Him Who justifies the ungodly his faith is credited to him as righteousness (the standing acceptable to God).
Romans,4,6,Thus David congratulates the man and pronounces a blessing on him to whom God credits righteousness apart from the works he does:
Romans,4,7,Blessed and happy and to be envied are those whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered up and completely buried.
Romans,4,8,Blessed and happy and to be envied is the person of whose sin the Lord will take no account nor reckon it against him.
Romans,4,9,Is this blessing (happiness) then meant only for the circumcised or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness.
Romans,4,10,How then was it credited [to him]? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after but before he was circumcised.
Romans,4,11,He received the mark of circumcision as a token or an evidence [and] seal of the righteousness which he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised--[faith] so that he was to be made the father of all who [truly] believe though without circumcision and who thus have righteousness (right standing with God) imputed to them and credited to their account
Romans,4,12,As well as [that he be made] the father of those circumcised persons who are not merely circumcised but also walk in the way of that faith which our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.
Romans,4,13,For the promise to Abraham or his posterity that he should inherit the world did not come through [observing the commands of] the Law but through the righteousness of faith.
Romans,4,14,If it is the adherents of the Law who are to be the heirs then faith is made futile and empty of all meaning and the promise [of God] is made void (is annulled and has no power).
Romans,4,15,For the Law results in [divine] wrath but where there is no law there is no transgression [of it either].
Romans,4,16,Therefore [inheriting] the promise is the outcome of faith and depends [entirely] on faith in order that it might be given as an act of grace (unmerited favor) to make it stable and valid and guaranteed to all his descendants--not only to the devotees and adherents of the Law but also to those who share the faith of Abraham who is [thus] the father of us all.
Romans,4,17,As it is written I have made you the father of many nations. [He was appointed our father] in the sight of God in Whom he believed Who gives life to the dead and speaks of the nonexistent things that [He has foretold and promised] as if they [already] existed.
Romans,4,18,[For Abraham human reason for] hope being gone hoped in faith that he should become the father of many nations as he had been promised So [numberless] shall your descendants be.
Romans,4,19,He did not weaken in faith when he considered the [utter] impotence of his own body which was as good as dead because he was about a hundred years old or [when he considered] the barrenness of Sarah's [deadened] womb.
Romans,4,20,No unbelief or distrust made him waver (doubtingly question) concerning the promise of God but he grew strong and was empowered by faith as he gave praise and glory to God
Romans,4,21,Fully satisfied and assured that God was able and mighty to keep His word and to do what He had promised.
Romans,4,22,That is why his faith was credited to him as righteousness (right standing with God).
Romans,4,23,But [the words] It was credited to him were written not for his sake alone
Romans,4,24,But [they were written] for our sakes too. [Righteousness standing acceptable to God] will be granted and credited to us also who believe in (trust in adhere to and rely on) God Who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead
Romans,4,25,Who was betrayed and put to death because of our misdeeds and was raised to secure our justification (our acquittal) [making our account balance and absolving us from all guilt before God].
Romans,5,1,THEREFORE SINCE we are justified ( acquitted declared righteous and given a right standing with God) through faith let us [grasp the fact that we] have [the peace of reconciliation to hold and to enjoy] peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One).
Romans,5,2,Through Him also we have [our] access (entrance introduction) by faith into this grace (state of God's favor) in which we [firmly and safely] stand. And let us rejoice and exult in our hope of experiencing and enjoying the glory of God.
Romans,5,3,Moreover [let us also be full of joy now!] let us exult and triumph in our troubles and rejoice in our sufferings knowing that pressure and affliction and hardship produce patient and unswerving endurance.
Romans,5,4,And endurance (fortitude) develops maturity of character (approved faith and tried integrity). And character [of this sort] produces [the habit of] joyful and confident hope of eternal salvation.
Romans,5,5,Such hope never disappoints or deludes or shames us for God's love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit Who has been given to us.
Romans,5,6,While we were yet in weakness [powerless to help ourselves] at the fitting time Christ died for (in behalf of) the ungodly.
Romans,5,7,Now it is an extraordinary thing for one to give his life even for an upright man though perhaps for a noble and lovable and generous benefactor someone might even dare to die.
Romans,5,8,But God shows and clearly proves His [own] love for us by the fact that while we were still sinners Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One) died for us.
Romans,5,9,Therefore since we are now justified ( acquitted made righteous and brought into right relationship with God) by Christ's blood how much more [certain is it that] we shall be saved by Him from the indignation and wrath of God.
Romans,5,10,For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son it is much more [certain] now that we are reconciled that we shall be saved (daily delivered from sin's dominion) through His [ resurrection] life.
Romans,5,11,Not only so but we also rejoice and exultingly glory in God [in His love and perfection] through our Lord Jesus Christ through Whom we have now received and enjoy [our] reconciliation.
Romans,5,12,Therefore as sin came into the world through one man and death as the result of sin so death spread to all men [ no one being able to stop it or to escape its power] because all men sinned.
Romans,5,13,[To be sure] sin was in the world before ever the Law was given but sin is not charged to men's account where there is no law [to transgress].
Romans,5,14,Yet death held sway from Adam to Moses [the Lawgiver] even over those who did not themselves transgress [a positive command] as Adam did. Adam was a type (prefigure) of the One Who was to come [in reverse the former destructive the Latter saving].
Romans,5,15,But God's free gift is not at all to be compared to the trespass [His grace is out of all proportion to the fall of man]. For if many died through one man's falling away (his lapse his offense) much more profusely did God's grace and the free gift [that comes] through the undeserved favor of the one Man Jesus Christ abound and overflow to and for [the benefit of] many.
Romans,5,16,Nor is the free gift at all to be compared to the effect of that one [man's] sin. For the sentence [following the trespass] of one [man] brought condemnation whereas the free gift [following] many transgressions brings justification ( an act of righteousness).
Romans,5,17,For if because of one man's trespass (lapse offense) death reigned through that one much more surely will those who receive [God's] overflowing grace (unmerited favor) and the free gift of righteousness [putting them into right standing with Himself] reign as kings in life through the one Man Jesus Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One).
Romans,5,18,Well then as one man's trespass [one man's false step and falling away led] to condemnation for all men so one Man's act of righteousness [leads] to acquittal and right standing with God and life for all men.
Romans,5,19,For just as by one man's disobedience (failing to hear heedlessness and carelessness) the many were constituted sinners so by one Man's obedience the many will be constituted righteous (made acceptable to God brought into right standing with Him).
Romans,5,20,But then Law came in [only] to expand and increase the trespass [making it more apparent and exciting opposition]. But where sin increased and abounded grace (God's unmerited favor) has surpassed it and increased the more and superabounded
Romans,5,21,So that [just] as sin has reigned in death [so] grace (His unearned and undeserved favor) might reign also through righteousness (right standing with God) which issues in eternal life through Jesus Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One) our Lord.
Romans,6,1,WHAT SHALL we say [to all this]? Are we to remain in sin in order that God's grace (favor and mercy) may multiply and overflow?
Romans,6,2,Certainly not! How can we who died to sin live in it any longer?
Romans,6,3,Are you ignorant of the fact that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?
Romans,6,4,We were buried therefore with Him by the baptism into death so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glorious [power] of the Father so we too might [habitually] live and behave in newness of life.
Romans,6,5,For if we have become one with Him by sharing a death like His we shall also be [one with Him in sharing] His resurrection [by a new life lived for God].
Romans,6,6,We know that our old (unrenewed) self was nailed to the cross with Him in order that [our] body [which is the instrument] of sin might be made ineffective and inactive for evil that we might no longer be the slaves of sin.
Romans,6,7,For when a man dies he is freed (loosed delivered) from [the power of] sin [among men].
Romans,6,8,Now if we have died with Christ we believe that we shall also live with Him
Romans,6,9,Because we know that Christ (the Anointed One) being once raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has power over Him.
Romans,6,10,For by the death He died He died to sin [ending His relation to it] once for all; and the life that He lives He is living to God [in unbroken fellowship with Him].
Romans,6,11,Even so consider yourselves also dead to sin and your relation to it broken but alive to God [living in unbroken fellowship with Him] in Christ Jesus.
Romans,6,12,Let not sin therefore rule as king in your mortal (short-lived perishable) bodies to make you yield to its cravings and be subject to its lusts and evil passions.
Romans,6,13,Do not continue offering or yielding your bodily members [and faculties] to sin as instruments (tools) of wickedness. But offer and yield yourselves to God as though you have been raised from the dead to [perpetual] life and your bodily members [and faculties] to God presenting them as implements of righteousness.
Romans,6,14,For sin shall not [any longer] exert dominion over you since now you are not under Law [as slaves] but under grace [as subjects of God's favor and mercy].
Romans,6,15,What then [are we to conclude]? Shall we sin because we live not under Law but under God's favor and mercy? Certainly not!
Romans,6,16,Do you not know that if you continually surrender yourselves to anyone to do his will you are the slaves of him whom you obey whether that be to sin which leads to death or to obedience which leads to righteousness (right doing and right standing with God)?
Romans,6,17,But thank God though you were once slaves of sin you have become obedient with all your heart to the standard of teaching in which you were instructed and to which you were committed.
Romans,6,18,And having been set free from sin you have become the servants of righteousness (of conformity to the divine will in thought purpose and action).
Romans,6,19,I am speaking in familiar human terms because of your natural limitations. For as you yielded your bodily members [and faculties] as servants to impurity and ever increasing lawlessness so now yield your bodily members [and faculties] once for all as servants to righteousness (right being and doing) [which leads] to sanctification.
Romans,6,20,For when you were slaves of sin you were free in regard to righteousness.
Romans,6,21,But then what benefit (return) did you get from the things of which you are now ashamed? [None] for the end of those things is death.
Romans,6,22,But now since you have been set free from sin and have become the slaves of God you have your present reward in holiness and its end is eternal life.
Romans,6,23,For the wages which sin pays is death but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.
Romans,7,1,DO YOU not know brethren--for I am speaking to men who are acquainted with the Law--that legal claims have power over a person only for as long as he is alive?
Romans,7,2,For [instance] a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives; but if her husband dies she is loosed and discharged from the law concerning her husband.
Romans,7,3,Accordingly she will be held an adulteress if she unites herself to another man while her husband lives. But if her husband dies the marriage law no longer is binding on her [she is free from that law]; and if she unites herself to another man she is not an adulteress.
Romans,7,4,Likewise my brethren you have undergone death as to the Law through the [crucified] body of Christ so that now you may belong to Another to Him Who was raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God.
Romans,7,5,When we were living in the flesh (mere physical lives) the sinful passions that were awakened and aroused up by [what] the Law [makes sin] were constantly operating in our natural powers (in our bodily organs in the sensitive appetites and wills of the flesh) so that we bore fruit for death.
Romans,7,6,But now we are discharged from the Law and have terminated all intercourse with it having died to what once restrained and held us captive. So now we serve not under [obedience to] the old code of written regulations but [under obedience to the promptings] of the Spirit in newness [of life].
Romans,7,7,What then do we conclude? Is the Law identical with sin? Certainly not! Nevertheless if it had not been for the Law I should not have recognized sin or have known its meaning. [For instance] I would not have known about covetousness [would have had no consciousness of sin or sense of guilt] if the Law had not [repeatedly] said You shall not covet and have an evil desire [for one thing and another].
Romans,7,8,But sin finding opportunity in the commandment [to express itself] got a hold on me and aroused and stimulated all kinds of forbidden desires (lust covetousness). For without the Law sin is dead [the sense of it is inactive and a lifeless thing].
Romans,7,9,Once I was alive but quite apart from and unconscious of the Law. But when the commandment came sin lived again and I died (was sentenced by the Law to death).
Romans,7,10,And the very legal ordinance which was designed and intended to bring life actually proved [to mean to me] death.
Romans,7,11,For sin seizing the opportunity and getting a hold on me [by taking its incentive] from the commandment beguiled and entrapped and cheated me and using it [as a weapon] killed me.
Romans,7,12,The Law therefore is holy and [each] commandment is holy and just and good.
Romans,7,13,Did that which is good then prove fatal [bringing death] to me? Certainly not! It was sin working death in me by using this good thing [as a weapon] in order that through the commandment sin might be shown up clearly to be sin that the extreme malignity and immeasurable sinfulness of sin might plainly appear.
Romans,7,14,We know that the Law is spiritual; but I am a creature of the flesh [carnal unspiritual] having been sold into slavery under [the control of] sin.
Romans,7,15,For I do not understand my own actions [I am baffled bewildered]. I do not practice or accomplish what I wish but I do the very thing that I loathe [ which my moral instinct condemns].
Romans,7,16,Now if I do [habitually] what is contrary to my desire [that means that] I acknowledge and agree that the Law is good (morally excellent) and that I take sides with it.
Romans,7,17,However it is no longer I who do the deed but the sin [principle] which is at home in me and has possession of me.
Romans,7,18,For I know that nothing good dwells within me that is in my flesh. I can will what is right but I cannot perform it. [I have the intention and urge to do what is right but no power to carry it out.]
Romans,7,19,For I fail to practice the good deeds I desire to do but the evil deeds that I do not desire to do are what I am [ever] doing.
Romans,7,20,Now if I do what I do not desire to do it is no longer I doing it [it is not myself that acts] but the sin [principle] which dwells within me [ fixed and operating in my soul].
Romans,7,21,So I find it to be a law (rule of action of my being) that when I want to do what is right and good evil is ever present with me and I am subject to its insistent demands.
Romans,7,22,For I endorse and delight in the Law of God in my inmost self [with my new nature].
Romans,7,23,But I discern in my bodily members [ in the sensitive appetites and wills of the flesh] a different law (rule of action) at war against the law of my mind (my reason) and making me a prisoner to the law of sin that dwells in my bodily organs [ in the sensitive appetites and wills of the flesh].
Romans,7,24,O unhappy and pitiable and wretched man that I am! Who will release and deliver me from [the shackles of] this body of death?
Romans,7,25,O thank God! [He will!] through Jesus Christ (the Anointed One) our Lord! So then indeed I of myself with the mind and heart serve the Law of God but with the flesh the law of sin.
Romans,8,1,THEREFORE [there is] now no condemnation (no adjudging guilty of wrong) for those who are in Christ Jesus who live [and] walk not after the dictates of the flesh but after the dictates of the Spirit.
Romans,8,2,For the law of the Spirit of life [which is] in Christ Jesus [the law of our new being] has freed me from the law of sin and of death.
Romans,8,3,For God has done what the Law could not do [its power] being weakened by the flesh [ the entire nature of man without the Holy Spirit]. Sending His own Son in the guise of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin [God] condemned sin in the flesh [ subdued overcame deprived it of its power over all who accept that sacrifice]
Romans,8,4,So that the righteous and just requirement of the Law might be fully met in us who live and move not in the ways of the flesh but in the ways of the Spirit [our lives governed not by the standards and according to the dictates of the flesh but controlled by the Holy Spirit].
Romans,8,5,For those who are according to the flesh and are controlled by its unholy desires set their minds on and pursue those things which gratify the flesh but those who are according to the Spirit and are controlled by the desires of the Spirit set their minds on and seek those things which gratify the [Holy] Spirit.
Romans,8,6,Now the mind of the flesh [which is sense and reason without the Holy Spirit] is death [death that comprises all the miseries arising from sin both here and hereafter]. But the mind of the [Holy] Spirit is life and [soul] peace [both now and forever].
Romans,8,7,[That is] because the mind of the flesh [with its carnal thoughts and purposes] is hostile to God for it does not submit itself to God's Law; indeed it cannot.
Romans,8,8,So then those who are living the life of the flesh [catering to the appetites and impulses of their carnal nature] cannot please or satisfy God or be acceptable to Him.
Romans,8,9,But you are not living the life of the flesh you are living the life of the Spirit if the [Holy] Spirit of God [really] dwells within you [directs and controls you]. But if anyone does not possess the [Holy] Spirit of Christ he is none of His [he does not belong to Christ is not truly a child of God].
Romans,8,10,But if Christ lives in you [then although] your [natural] body is dead by reason of sin and guilt the spirit is alive because of [the] righteousness [that He imputes to you].
Romans,8,11,And if the Spirit of Him Who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you [then] He Who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also restore to life your mortal (short-lived perishable) bodies through His Spirit Who dwells in you.
Romans,8,12,So then brethren we are debtors but not to the flesh [we are not obligated to our carnal nature] to live [a life ruled by the standards set up by the dictates] of the flesh.
Romans,8,13,For if you live according to [the dictates of] the flesh you will surely die. But if through the power of the [Holy] Spirit you are [habitually] putting to death (making extinct deadening) the [evil] deeds prompted by the body you shall [really and genuinely] live forever.
Romans,8,14,For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.
Romans,8,15,For [the Spirit which] you have now received [is] not a spirit of slavery to put you once more in bondage to fear but you have received the Spirit of adoption [the Spirit producing sonship] in [the bliss of] which we cry Abba (Father)! Father!
Romans,8,16,The Spirit Himself [thus] testifies together with our own spirit [assuring us] that we are children of God.
Romans,8,17,And if we are [His] children then we are [His] heirs also: heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ [sharing His inheritance with Him]; only we must share His suffering if we are to share His glory.
Romans,8,18,[But what of that?] For I consider that the sufferings of this present time (this present life) are not worth being compared with the glory that is about to be revealed to us and in us and for us and conferred on us!
Romans,8,19,For [even the whole] creation (all nature) waits expectantly and longs earnestly for God's sons to be made known [waits for the revealing the disclosing of their sonship].
Romans,8,20,For the creation (nature) was subjected to frailty (to futility condemned to frustration) not because of some intentional fault on its part but by the will of Him Who so subjected it--[yet] with the hope
Romans,8,21,That nature (creation) itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and corruption [and gain an entrance] into the glorious freedom of God's children.
Romans,8,22,We know that the whole creation [of irrational creatures] has been moaning together in the pains of labor until now.
Romans,8,23,And not only the creation but we ourselves too who have and enjoy the firstfruits of the [Holy] Spirit [a foretaste of the blissful things to come] groan inwardly as we wait for the redemption of our bodies [from sensuality and the grave which will reveal] our adoption (our manifestation as God's sons).
Romans,8,24,For in [this] hope we were saved. But hope [the object of] which is seen is not hope. For how can one hope for what he already sees?
Romans,8,25,But if we hope for what is still unseen by us we wait for it with patience and composure.
Romans,8,26,So too the [Holy] Spirit comes to our aid and bears us up in our weakness; for we do not know what prayer to offer nor how to offer it worthily as we ought but the Spirit Himself goes to meet our supplication and pleads in our behalf with unspeakable yearnings and groanings too deep for utterance.
Romans,8,27,And He Who searches the hearts of men knows what is in the mind of the [Holy] Spirit [what His intent is] because the Spirit intercedes and pleads [before God] in behalf of the saints according to and in harmony with God's will.
Romans,8,28,We are assured and know that [ God being a partner in their labor] all things work together and are [fitting into a plan] for good to and for those who love God and are called according to [His] design and purpose.
Romans,8,29,For those whom He foreknew [of whom He was aware and loved beforehand] He also destined from the beginning [foreordaining them] to be molded into the image of His Son [and share inwardly His likeness] that He might become the firstborn among many brethren.
Romans,8,30,And those whom He thus foreordained He also called; and those whom He called He also justified (acquitted made righteous putting them into right standing with Himself). And those whom He justified He also glorified [raising them to a heavenly dignity and condition or state of being].
Romans,8,31,What then shall we say to [all] this? If God is for us who [can be] against us? [Who can be our foe if God is on our side?]
Romans,8,32,He who did not withhold or spare [even] His own Son but gave Him up for us all will He not also with Him freely and graciously give us all [other] things?
Romans,8,33,Who shall bring any charge against God's elect [when it is] God Who justifies [that is Who puts us in right relation to Himself? Who shall come forward and accuse or impeach those whom God has chosen? Will God Who acquits us?]
Romans,8,34,Who is there to condemn [us]? Will Christ Jesus (the Messiah) Who died or rather Who was raised from the dead Who is at the right hand of God actually pleading as He intercedes for us?
Romans,8,35,Who shall ever separate us from Christ's love? Shall suffering and affliction and tribulation? Or calamity and distress? Or persecution or hunger or destitution or peril or sword?
Romans,8,36,Even as it is written For Thy sake we are put to death all the day long; we are regarded and counted as sheep for the slaughter.
Romans,8,37,Yet amid all these things we are more than conquerors and gain a surpassing victory through Him Who loved us.
Romans,8,38,For I am persuaded beyond doubt (am sure) that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things impending and threatening nor things to come nor powers
Romans,8,39,Nor height nor depth nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Romans,9,1,I AM speaking the truth in Christ. I am not lying; my conscience [enlightened and prompted] by the Holy Spirit bearing witness with me
Romans,9,2,That I have bitter grief and incessant anguish in my heart.
Romans,9,3,For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off and banished from Christ for the sake of my brethren and instead of them my natural kinsmen and my fellow countrymen.
Romans,9,4,For they are Israelites and to them belong God's adoption [as a nation] and the glorious Presence (Shekinah). With them were the special covenants made to them was the Law given. To them [the temple] worship was revealed and [God's own] promises announced.
Romans,9,5,To them belong the patriarchs and as far as His natural descent was concerned from them is the Christ Who is exalted and supreme over all God blessed forever! Amen (so let it be).
Romans,9,6,However it is not as though God's Word had failed [coming to nothing]. For it is not everybody who is a descendant of Jacob (Israel) who belongs to [the true] Israel.
Romans,9,7,And they are not all the children of Abraham because they are by blood his descendants. No [the promise was] Your descendants will be called and counted through the line of Isaac [though Abraham had an older son].
Romans,9,8,That is to say it is not the children of the body [of Abraham] who are made God's children but it is the offspring to whom the promise applies that shall be counted [as Abraham's true] descendants.
Romans,9,9,For this is what the promise said About this time [next year] will I return and Sarah shall have a son.
Romans,9,10,And not only that but this too: Rebecca conceived [two sons under exactly the same circumstances] by our forefather Isaac
Romans,9,11,And the children were yet unborn and had so far done nothing either good or evil. Even so in order further to carry out God's purpose of selection (election choice) which depends not on works or what men can do but on Him Who calls [them]
Romans,9,12,It was said to her that the elder [son] should serve the younger [son].
Romans,9,13,As it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated (held in relative disregard in comparison with My feeling for Jacob).
Romans,9,14,What shall we conclude then? Is there injustice upon God's part? Certainly not!
Romans,9,15,For He says to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion (pity) on whom I will have compassion.
Romans,9,16,So then [God's gift] is not a question of human will and human effort but of God's mercy. [It depends not on one's own willingness nor on his strenuous exertion as in running a race but on God's having mercy on him.]
Romans,9,17,For the Scripture says to Pharaoh I have raised you up for this very purpose of displaying My power in [dealing with] you so that My name may be proclaimed the whole world over.
Romans,9,18,So then He has mercy on whomever He wills (chooses) and He hardens (makes stubborn and unyielding the heart of) whomever He wills.
Romans,9,19,You will say to me Why then does He still find fault and blame us [for sinning]? For who can resist and withstand His will?
Romans,9,20,But who are you a mere man to criticize and contradict and answer back to God? Will what is formed say to him that formed it Why have you made me thus?
Romans,9,21,Has the potter no right over the clay to make out of the same mass (lump) one vessel for beauty and distinction and honorable use and another for menial or ignoble and dishonorable use?
Romans,9,22,What if God although fully intending to show [the awfulness of] His wrath and to make known His power and authority has tolerated with much patience the vessels (objects) of [His] anger which are ripe for destruction?
Romans,9,23,And [what if] He thus purposes to make known and show the wealth of His glory in [dealing with] the vessels (objects) of His mercy which He has prepared beforehand for glory
Romans,9,24,Even including ourselves whom He has called not only from among the Jews but also from among the Gentiles (heathen)?
Romans,9,25,Just as He says in Hosea Those who were not My people I will call My people and her who was not beloved [I will call] My beloved.
Romans,9,26,And it shall be that in the very place where it was said to them You are not My people they shall be called sons of the living God.
Romans,9,27,And Isaiah calls out (solemnly cries aloud) over Israel: Though the number of the sons of Israel be like the sand of the sea only the remnant (a small part of them) will be saved [ from perdition condemnation judgment]!
Romans,9,28,For the Lord will execute His sentence upon the earth [He will conclude and close His account with men completely and without delay] rigorously cutting it short in His justice.
Romans,9,29,It is as Isaiah predicted If the Lord of hosts had not left us a seed [from which to propagate descendants] we [Israel] would have fared like Sodom and have been made like Gomorrah.
Romans,9,30,What shall we say then? That Gentiles who did not follow after righteousness [who did not seek salvation by right relationship to God] have attained it by faith [a righteousness imputed by God based on and produced by faith]
Romans,9,31,Whereas Israel though ever in pursuit of a law [for the securing] of righteousness (right standing with God) actually did not succeed in fulfilling the Law.
Romans,9,32,For what reason? Because [they pursued it] not through faith relying [instead] on the merit of their works [they did not depend on faith but on what they could do]. They have stumbled over the Stumbling Stone.
Romans,9,33,As it is written Behold I am laying in Zion a Stone that will make men stumble a Rock that will make them fall; but he who believes in Him [who adheres to trusts in and relies on Him] shall not be put to shame nor be disappointed in his expectations.
Romans,10,1,BRETHREN [with all] my heart's desire and goodwill for [Israel] I long and pray to God that they may be saved.
Romans,10,2,I bear them witness that they have a [certain] zeal and enthusiasm for God but it is not enlightened and according to [correct and vital] knowledge.
Romans,10,3,For being ignorant of the righteousness that God ascribes [which makes one acceptable to Him in word thought and deed] and seeking to establish a righteousness (a means of salvation) of their own they did not obey or submit themselves to God's righteousness.
Romans,10,4,For Christ is the end of the Law [the limit at which it ceases to be for the Law leads up to Him Who is the fulfillment of its types and in Him the purpose which it was designed to accomplish is fulfilled. That is the purpose of the Law is fulfilled in Him] as the means of righteousness (right relationship to God) for everyone who trusts in and adheres to and relies on Him.
Romans,10,5,For Moses writes that the man who [can] practice the righteousness (perfect conformity to God's will) which is based on the Law [with all its intricate demands] shall live by it.
Romans,10,6,But the righteousness based on faith [imputed by God and bringing right relationship with Him] says Do not say in your heart Who will ascend into Heaven? that is to bring Christ down;
Romans,10,7,Or who will descend into the abyss? that is to bring Christ up from the dead [as if we could be saved by our own efforts].
Romans,10,8,But what does it say? The Word (God's message in Christ) is near you on your lips and in your heart; that is the Word (the message the basis and object) of faith which we preach
Romans,10,9,Because if you acknowledge and confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and in your heart believe (adhere to trust in and rely on the truth) that God raised Him from the dead you will be saved.
Romans,10,10,For with the heart a person believes (adheres to trusts in and relies on Christ) and so is justified (declared righteous acceptable to God) and with the mouth he confesses (declares openly and speaks out freely his faith) and confirms [his] salvation.
Romans,10,11,The Scripture says No man who believes in Him [who adheres to relies on and trusts in Him] will [ever] be put to shame or be disappointed.
Romans,10,12,[No one] for there is no distinction between Jew and Greek. The same Lord is Lord over all [of us] and He generously bestows His riches upon all who call upon Him [in faith].
Romans,10,13,For everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord [invoking Him as Lord] will be saved.
Romans,10,14,But how are people to call upon Him Whom they have not believed [in Whom they have no faith on Whom they have no reliance]? And how are they to believe in Him [adhere to trust in and rely upon Him] of Whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without a preacher?
Romans,10,15,And how can men [be expected to] preach unless they are sent? As it is written How beautiful are the feet of those who bring glad tidings! [How welcome is the coming of those who preach the good news of His good things!]
Romans,10,16,But they have not all heeded the Gospel; for Isaiah says Lord who has believed (had faith in) what he has heard from us?
Romans,10,17,So faith comes by hearing [what is told] and what is heard comes by the preaching [of the message that came from the lips] of Christ (the Messiah Himself).
Romans,10,18,But I ask Have they not heard? Indeed they have; [for the Scripture says] Their voice [that of nature bearing God's message] has gone out to all the earth and their words to the far bounds of the world.
Romans,10,19,Again I ask Did Israel not understand? [Did the Jews have no warning that the Gospel was to go forth to the Gentiles to all the earth?] First there is Moses who says I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation; with a foolish nation I will make you angry.
Romans,10,20,Then Isaiah is so bold as to say I have been found by those who did not seek Me; I have shown (revealed) Myself to those who did not [consciously] ask for Me.
Romans,10,21,But of Israel he says All day long I have stretched out My hands to a people unyielding and disobedient and self-willed [to a faultfinding contrary and contradicting people].
Romans,11,1,I ASK then: Has God totally rejected and disowned His people? Of course not! Why I myself am an Israelite a descendant of Abraham a member of the tribe of Benjamin! [I Sam. 12:22; Jer. 31:37; 33:24-26; Phil. 3:5.]
Romans,11,2,No God has not rejected and disowned His people [whose destiny] He had marked out and appointed and foreknown from the beginning. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah how he pleads with God against Israel?
Romans,11,3,Lord they have killed Your prophets; they have demolished Your altars and I alone am left and they seek my life.
Romans,11,4,But what is God's reply to him? I have kept for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal! [I Kings 19:18.]
Romans,11,5,So too at the present time there is a remnant (a small believing minority) selected (chosen) by grace (by God's unmerited favor and graciousness).
Romans,11,6,But if it is by grace (His unmerited favor and graciousness) it is no longer conditioned on works or anything men have done. Otherwise grace would no longer be grace [it would be meaningless].
Romans,11,7,What then [shall we conclude]? Israel failed to obtain what it sought [God's favor by obedience to the Law]. Only the elect (those chosen few) obtained it while the rest of them became callously indifferent (blinded hardened and made insensible to it).
Romans,11,8,As it is written God gave them a spirit (an attitude) of stupor eyes that should not see and ears that should not hear [that has continued] down to this very day.
Romans,11,9,And David says Let their table (their feasting banqueting) become a snare and a trap a pitfall and a just retribution [ rebounding like a boomerang upon them];
Romans,11,10,Let their eyes be darkened (dimmed) so that they cannot see and make them bend their back [stooping beneath their burden] forever.
Romans,11,11,So I ask Have they stumbled so as to fall [to their utter spiritual ruin irretrievably]? By no means! But through their false step and transgression salvation [has come] to the Gentiles so as to arouse Israel [to see and feel what they forfeited] and so to make them jealous.
Romans,11,12,Now if their stumbling (their lapse their transgression) has so enriched the world [at large] and if [Israel's] failure means such riches for the Gentiles think what an enrichment and greater advantage will follow their full reinstatement!
Romans,11,13,But now I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles I lay great stress on my ministry and magnify my office
Romans,11,14,In the hope of making my fellow Jews jealous [in order to stir them up to imitate copy and appropriate] and thus managing to save some of them.
Romans,11,15,For if their rejection and exclusion from the benefits of salvation were [overruled] for the reconciliation of a world to God what will their acceptance and admission mean? [It will be nothing short of] life from the dead!
Romans,11,16,Now if the first handful of dough offered as the firstfruits [Abraham and the patriarchs] is consecrated (holy) so is the whole mass [the nation of Israel]; and if the root [Abraham] is consecrated (holy) so are the branches.
Romans,11,17,But if some of the branches were broken off while you a wild olive shoot were grafted in among them to share the richness [of the root and sap] of the olive tree
Romans,11,18,Do not boast over the branches and pride yourself at their expense. If you do boast and feel superior remember it is not you that support the root but the root [that supports] you.
Romans,11,19,You will say then Branches were broken (pruned) off so that I might be grafted in!
Romans,11,20,That is true. But they were broken (pruned) off because of their unbelief (their lack of real faith) and you are established through faith [because you do believe]. So do not become proud and conceited but rather stand in awe and be reverently afraid.
Romans,11,21,For if God did not spare the natural branches [because of unbelief] neither will He spare you [if you are guilty of the same offense].
Romans,11,22,Then note and appreciate the gracious kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen but God's gracious kindness to you--provided you continue in His grace and abide in His kindness; otherwise you too will be cut off (pruned away).
Romans,11,23,And even those others [the fallen branches Jews] if they do not persist in [clinging to] their unbelief will be grafted in for God has the power to graft them in again.
Romans,11,24,For if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree and against nature grafted into a cultivated olive tree how much easier will it be to graft these natural [branches] back on [the original parent stock of] their own olive tree.
Romans,11,25,Lest you be self-opinionated (wise in your own conceits) I do not want you to miss this hidden truth and mystery brethren: a hardening (insensibility) has [temporarily] befallen a part of Israel [to last] until the full number of the ingathering of the Gentiles has come in
Romans,11,26,And so all Israel will be saved. As it is written The Deliverer will come from Zion He will banish ungodliness from Jacob.
Romans,11,27,And this will be My covenant (My agreement) with them when I shall take away their sins.
Romans,11,28,From the point of view of the Gospel (good news) they [the Jews at present] are enemies [of God] which is for your advantage and benefit. But from the point of view of God's choice (of election of divine selection) they are still the beloved (dear to Him) for the sake of their forefathers.
Romans,11,29,For God's gifts and His call are irrevocable. [He never withdraws them when once they are given and He does not change His mind about those to whom He gives His grace or to whom He sends His call.]
Romans,11,30,Just as you were once disobedient and rebellious toward God but now have obtained [His] mercy through their disobedience
Romans,11,31,So they also now are being disobedient [when you are receiving mercy] that they in turn may one day through the mercy you are enjoying also receive mercy [that they may share the mercy which has been shown to you--through you as messengers of the Gospel to them].
Romans,11,32,For God has consigned (penned up) all men to disobedience only that He may have mercy on them all [alike].
Romans,11,33,Oh the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unfathomable (inscrutable unsearchable) are His judgments (His decisions)! And how untraceable (mysterious undiscoverable) are His ways (His methods His paths)!
Romans,11,34,For who has known the mind of the Lord and who has understood His thoughts or who has [ever] been His counselor?
Romans,11,35,Or who has first given God anything that he might be paid back or that he could claim a recompense?
Romans,11,36,For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. [For all things originate with Him and come from Him; all things live through Him and all things center in and tend to consummate and to end in Him.] To Him be glory forever! Amen (so be it).
Romans,12,1,I APPEAL to you therefore brethren and beg of you in view of [all] the mercies of God to make a decisive dedication of your bodies [presenting all your members and faculties] as a living sacrifice holy (devoted consecrated) and well pleasing to God which is your reasonable (rational intelligent) service and spiritual worship.
Romans,12,2,Do not be conformed to this world (this age) [fashioned after and adapted to its external superficial customs] but be transformed (changed) by the [entire] renewal of your mind [by its new ideals and its new attitude] so that you may prove [for yourselves] what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God even the thing which is good and acceptable and perfect [in His sight for you].
Romans,12,3,For by the grace (unmerited favor of God) given to me I warn everyone among you not to estimate and think of himself more highly than he ought [not to have an exaggerated opinion of his own importance] but to rate his ability with sober judgment each according to the degree of faith apportioned by God to him.
Romans,12,4,For as in one physical body we have many parts (organs members) and all of these parts do not have the same function or use
Romans,12,5,So we numerous as we are are one body in Christ (the Messiah) and individually we are parts one of another [mutually dependent on one another].
Romans,12,6,Having gifts (faculties talents qualities) that differ according to the grace given us let us use them: [He whose gift is] prophecy [let him prophesy] according to the proportion of his faith;
Romans,12,7,[He whose gift is] practical service let him give himself to serving; he who teaches to his teaching;
Romans,12,8,He who exhorts (encourages) to his exhortation; he who contributes let him do it in simplicity and liberality; he who gives aid and superintends with zeal and singleness of mind; he who does acts of mercy with genuine cheerfulness and joyful eagerness.
Romans,12,9,[Let your] love be sincere (a real thing); hate what is evil [loathe all ungodliness turn in horror from wickedness] but hold fast to that which is good.
Romans,12,10,Love one another with brotherly affection [as members of one family] giving precedence and showing honor to one another.
Romans,12,11,Never lag in zeal and in earnest endeavor; be aglow and burning with the Spirit serving the Lord.
Romans,12,12,Rejoice and exult in hope; be steadfast and patient in suffering and tribulation; be constant in prayer.
Romans,12,13,Contribute to the needs of God's people [sharing in the necessities of the saints]; pursue the practice of hospitality.
Romans,12,14,Bless those who persecute you [who are cruel in their attitude toward you]; bless and do not curse them.
Romans,12,15,Rejoice with those who rejoice [sharing others' joy] and weep with those who weep [sharing others' grief].
Romans,12,16,Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty (snobbish high-minded exclusive) but readily adjust yourself to [people things] and give yourselves to humble tasks. Never overestimate yourself or be wise in your own conceits.
Romans,12,17,Repay no one evil for evil but take thought for what is honest and proper and noble [aiming to be above reproach] in the sight of everyone.
Romans,12,18,If possible as far as it depends on you live at peace with everyone.
Romans,12,19,Beloved never avenge yourselves but leave the way open for [God's] wrath; for it is written Vengeance is Mine I will repay (requite) says the Lord.
Romans,12,20,But if your enemy is hungry feed him; if he is thirsty give him drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals upon his head.
Romans,12,21,Do not let yourself be overcome by evil but overcome (master) evil with good.
Romans,13,1,LET EVERY person be loyally subject to the governing (civil) authorities. For there is no authority except from God [by His permission His sanction] and those that exist do so by God's appointment.
Romans,13,2,Therefore he who resists and sets himself up against the authorities resists what God has appointed and arranged [in divine order]. And those who resist will bring down judgment upon themselves [receiving the penalty due them].
Romans,13,3,For civil authorities are not a terror to [people of] good conduct but to [those of] bad behavior. Would you have no dread of him who is in authority? Then do what is right and you will receive his approval and commendation.
Romans,13,4,For he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong [you should dread him and] be afraid for he does not bear and wear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant to execute His wrath (punishment vengeance) on the wrongdoer.
Romans,13,5,Therefore one must be subject not only to avoid God's wrath and escape punishment but also as a matter of principle and for the sake of conscience.
Romans,13,6,For this same reason you pay taxes for [the civil authorities] are official servants under God devoting themselves to attending to this very service.
Romans,13,7,Render to all men their dues. [Pay] taxes to whom taxes are due revenue to whom revenue is due respect to whom respect is due and honor to whom honor is due.
Romans,13,8,Keep out of debt and owe no man anything except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor [who practices loving others] has fulfilled the Law [relating to one's fellowmen meeting all its requirements].
Romans,13,9,The commandments You shall not commit adultery You shall not kill You shall not steal You shall not covet (have an evil desire) and any other commandment are summed up in the single command You shall love your neighbor as [you do] yourself.
Romans,13,10,Love does no wrong to one's neighbor [it never hurts anybody]. Therefore love meets all the requirements and is the fulfilling of the Law.
Romans,13,11,Besides this you know what [a critical] hour this is how it is high time now for you to wake up out of your sleep (rouse to reality). For salvation (final deliverance) is nearer to us now than when we first believed (adhered to trusted in and relied on Christ the Messiah).
Romans,13,12,The night is far gone and the day is almost here. Let us then drop (fling away) the works and deeds of darkness and put on the [full] armor of light.
Romans,13,13,Let us live and conduct ourselves honorably and becomingly as in the [open light of] day not in reveling (carousing) and drunkenness not in immorality and debauchery (sensuality and licentiousness) not in quarreling and jealousy.
Romans,13,14,But clothe yourself with the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) and make no provision for [indulging] the flesh [put a stop to thinking about the evil cravings of your physical nature] to [gratify its] desires (lusts).
Romans,14,1,AS FOR the man who is a weak believer welcome him [into your fellowship] but not to criticize his opinions or pass judgment on his scruples or perplex him with discussions.
Romans,14,2,One [man's faith permits him to] believe he may eat anything while a weaker one [limits his] eating to vegetables.
Romans,14,3,Let not him who eats look down on or despise him who abstains and let not him who abstains criticize and pass judgment on him who eats; for God has accepted and welcomed him.
Romans,14,4,Who are you to pass judgment on and censure another's household servant? It is before his own master that he stands or falls. And he shall stand and be upheld for the Master (the Lord) is mighty to support him and make him stand.
Romans,14,5,One man esteems one day as better than another while another man esteems all days alike [sacred]. Let everyone be fully convinced (satisfied) in his own mind.
Romans,14,6,He who observes the day observes it in honor of the Lord. He also who eats eats in honor of the Lord since he gives thanks to God; while he who abstains abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God.
Romans,14,7,None of us lives to himself [but to the Lord] and none of us dies to himself [but to the Lord for]
Romans,14,8,If we live we live to the Lord and if we die we die to the Lord. So then whether we live or we die we belong to the Lord.
Romans,14,9,For Christ died and lived again for this very purpose that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.
Romans,14,10,Why do you criticize and pass judgment on your brother? Or you why do you look down upon or despise your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God.
Romans,14,11,For it is written As I live says the Lord every knee shall bow to Me and every tongue shall confess to God [acknowledge Him to His honor and to His praise].
Romans,14,12,And so each of us shall give an account of himself [give an answer in reference to judgment] to God.
Romans,14,13,Then let us no more criticize and blame and pass judgment on one another but rather decide and endeavor never to put a stumbling block or an obstacle or a hindrance in the way of a brother.
Romans,14,14,I know and am convinced (persuaded) as one in the Lord Jesus that nothing is [forbidden as] essentially unclean (defiled and unholy in itself). But [none the less] it is unclean (defiled and unholy) to anyone who thinks it is unclean.
Romans,14,15,But if your brother is being pained or his feelings hurt or if he is being injured by what you eat [then] you are no longer walking in love. [You have ceased to be living and conducting yourself by the standard of love toward him.] Do not let what you eat hurt or cause the ruin of one for whom Christ died!
Romans,14,16,Do not therefore let what seems good to you be considered an evil thing [by someone else]. [In other words do not give occasion for others to criticize that which is justifiable for you.]
Romans,14,17,[After all] the kingdom of God is not a matter of [getting the] food and drink [one likes] but instead it is righteousness (that state which makes a person acceptable to God) and [heart] peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
Romans,14,18,He who serves Christ in this way is acceptable and pleasing to God and is approved by men.
Romans,14,19,So let us then definitely aim for and eagerly pursue what makes for harmony and for mutual upbuilding (edification and development) of one another.
Romans,14,20,You must not for the sake of food undo and break down and destroy the work of God! Everything is indeed [ceremonially] clean and pure but it is wrong for anyone to hurt the conscience of others or to make them fall by what he eats.
Romans,14,21,The right thing is to eat no meat or drink no wine [at all] or [do anything else] if it makes your brother stumble or hurts his conscience or offends or weakens him.
Romans,14,22,Your personal convictions [on such matters]--exercise [them] as in God's presence keeping them to yourself [striving only to know the truth and obey His will]. Blessed (happy to be envied) is he who has no reason to judge himself for what he approves [who does not convict himself by what he chooses to do].
Romans,14,23,But the man who has doubts (misgivings an uneasy conscience) about eating and then eats [perhaps because of you] stands condemned [before God] because he is not true to his convictions and he does not act from faith. For whatever does not originate and proceed from faith is sin [whatever is done without a conviction of its approval by God is sinful].
Romans,15,1,WE WHO are strong [in our convictions and of robust faith] ought to bear with the failings and the frailties and the tender scruples of the weak; [we ought to help carry the doubts and qualms of others] and not to please ourselves.
Romans,15,2,Let each one of us make it a practice to please (make happy) his neighbor for his good and for his true welfare to edify him [to strengthen him and build him up spiritually].
Romans,15,3,For Christ did not please Himself [gave no thought to His own interests]; but as it is written The reproaches and abuses of those who reproached and abused you fell on Me.
Romans,15,4,For whatever was thus written in former days was written for our instruction that by [our steadfast and patient] endurance and the encouragement [drawn] from the Scriptures we might hold fast to and cherish hope.
Romans,15,5,Now may the God Who gives the power of patient endurance (steadfastness) and Who supplies encouragement grant you to live in such mutual harmony and such full sympathy with one another in accord with Christ Jesus
Romans,15,6,That together you may [unanimously] with united hearts and one voice praise and glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah).
Romans,15,7,Welcome and receive [to your hearts] one another then even as Christ has welcomed and received you for the glory of God.
Romans,15,8,For I tell you that Christ (the Messiah) became a servant and a minister to the circumcised (the Jews) in order to show God's truthfulness and honesty by confirming (verifying) the promises [given] to our fathers
Romans,15,9,And [also in order] that the Gentiles (nations) might glorify God for His mercy [not covenanted] to them. As it is written Therefore I will praise You among the Gentiles and sing praises to Your name.
Romans,15,10,Again it is said Rejoice (exult) O Gentiles along with His [own] people;
Romans,15,11,And again Praise the Lord all you Gentiles and let all the peoples praise Him!
Romans,15,12,And further Isaiah says There shall be a Sprout from the Root of Jesse He Who rises to rule over the Gentiles; in Him shall the Gentiles hope.
Romans,15,13,May the God of your hope so fill you with all joy and peace in believing [through the experience of your faith] that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound and be overflowing (bubbling over) with hope.
Romans,15,14,Personally I am satisfied about you my brethren that you yourselves are rich in goodness amply filled with all [spiritual] knowledge and competent to admonish and counsel and instruct one another also.
Romans,15,15,Still on some points I have written to you the more boldly and unreservedly by way of reminder. [I have done so] because of the grace (the unmerited favor) bestowed on me by God
Romans,15,16,In making me a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles. I act in the priestly service of the Gospel (the good news) of God in order that the sacrificial offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable [to God] consecrated and made holy by the Holy Spirit.
Romans,15,17,In Christ Jesus then I have legitimate reason to glory (exult) in my work for God [in what through Christ Jesus I have accomplished concerning the things of God].
Romans,15,18,For [of course] I will not venture (presume) to speak thus of any work except what Christ has actually done through me [as an instrument in His hands] to win obedience from the Gentiles by word and deed
Romans,15,19,[Even as my preaching has been accompanied] with the power of signs and wonders [and all of it] by the power of the Holy Spirit. [The result is] that starting from Jerusalem and as far round as Illyricum I have fully preached the Gospel [faithfully executing accomplishing carrying out to the full the good news] of Christ (the Messiah) in its entirety.
Romans,15,20,Thus my ambition has been to preach the Gospel not where Christ's name has already been known lest I build on another man's foundation;
Romans,15,21,But [instead I would act on the principle] as it is written They shall see who have never been told of Him and they shall understand who have never heard [of Him].
Romans,15,22,This [ambition] is the reason why I have so frequently been hindered from coming to visit you.
Romans,15,23,But now since I have no further opportunity for work in these regions and since I have longed for enough years to come to you
Romans,15,24,I hope to see you in passing [through Rome] as I go [on my intended trip] to Spain and to be aided on my journey there by you after I have enjoyed your company for a little while.
Romans,15,25,For the present however I am going to Jerusalem to bring aid (relief) for the saints (God's people there).
Romans,15,26,For it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make some contribution for the poor among the saints of Jerusalem.
Romans,15,27,They were pleased to do it; and surely they are in debt to them for if these Gentiles have come to share in their [the Jerusalem Jews'] spiritual blessings then they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings.
Romans,15,28,When therefore I have completed this mission and have delivered to them [at Jerusalem] what has been raised I shall go on by way of you to Spain.
Romans,15,29,And I know that when I do come to you I shall come in the abundant blessing of the Gospel of Christ.
Romans,15,30,I appeal to you [I entreat you] brethren for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love [given by] the Spirit to unite with me in earnest wrestling in prayer to God in my behalf.
Romans,15,31,[Pray] that I may be delivered (rescued) from the unbelievers in Judea and that my mission of relief to Jerusalem may be acceptable and graciously received by the saints (God's people there)
Romans,15,32,So that by God's will I may subsequently come to you with joy (with a happy heart) and be refreshed [by the interval of rest] in your company.
Romans,15,33,May [our] peace-giving God be with you all! Amen (so be it).
Romans,16,1,NOW I introduce and commend to you our sister Phoebe a deaconess of the church at Cenchreae
Romans,16,2,That you may receive her in the Lord [with a Christian welcome] as saints (God's people) ought to receive one another. And help her in whatever matter she may require assistance from you for she has been a helper of many including myself [shielding us from suffering].
Romans,16,3,Give my greetings to Prisca and Aquila my fellow workers in Christ Jesus
Romans,16,4,Who risked their lives [endangering their very necks] for my life. To them not only I but also all the churches among the Gentiles give thanks.
Romans,16,5,[Remember me] also to the church [that meets] in their house. Greet my beloved Epaenetus who was a firstfruit (first convert) to Christ in Asia.
Romans,16,6,Greet Mary who has worked so hard among you.
Romans,16,7,Remember me to Andronicus and Junias my tribal kinsmen and once my fellow prisoners. They are men held in high esteem among the apostles who also were in Christ before I was.
Romans,16,8,Remember me to Ampliatus my beloved in the Lord.
Romans,16,9,Salute Urbanus our fellow worker in Christ and my dear Stachys.
Romans,16,10,Greet Apelles that one tried and approved in Christ (the Messiah). Remember me to those who belong to the household of Aristobulus.
Romans,16,11,Greet my tribal kinsman Herodion and those in the Lord who belong to the household of Narcissus.
Romans,16,12,Salute those workers in the Lord Tryphaena and Tryphosa. Greet my dear Persis who has worked so hard in the Lord.
Romans,16,13,Remember me to Rufus eminent in the Lord also to his mother [who has been] a mother to me as well.
Romans,16,14,Greet Asyncritus Phlegon Hermes Patrobas Hermas and the brethren who are with them.
Romans,16,15,Greet Philologus Julia Nereus and his sister and Olympas and all the saints who are with them.
Romans,16,16,Greet one another with a holy (consecrated) kiss. All the churches of Christ (the Messiah) wish to be remembered to you.
Romans,16,17,I appeal to you brethren to be on your guard concerning those who create dissensions and difficulties and cause divisions in opposition to the doctrine (the teaching) which you have been taught. [I warn you to turn aside from them to] avoid them.
Romans,16,18,For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ but their own appetites and base desires and by ingratiating and flattering speech they beguile the hearts of the unsuspecting and simpleminded [people].
Romans,16,19,For while your loyalty and obedience is known to all so that I rejoice over you I would have you well versed and wise as to what is good and innocent and guileless as to what is evil.
Romans,16,20,And the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) be with you.
Romans,16,21,Timothy my fellow worker wishes to be remembered to you as do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater my tribal kinsmen.
Romans,16,22,I Tertius the writer of this letter greet you in the Lord.
Romans,16,23,Gaius who is host to me and to the whole church here greets you. So do Erastus the city treasurer and our brother Quartus.
Romans,16,24,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) be with you all. Amen (so be it).
Romans,16,25,Now to Him Who is able to strengthen you in the faith which is in accordance with my Gospel and the preaching of (concerning) Jesus Christ (the Messiah) according to the revelation (the unveiling) of the mystery of the plan of redemption which was kept in silence and secret for long ages
Romans,16,26,But is now disclosed and through the prophetic Scriptures is made known to all nations according to the command of the eternal God [to win them] to obedience to the faith
Romans,16,27,To [the] only wise God be glory forevermore through Jesus Christ (the Anointed One)! Amen (so be it).
1 Corinthians,1,1,PAUL SUMMONED by the will and purpose of God to be an apostle (special messenger) of Christ Jesus and our brother Sosthenes
1 Corinthians,1,2,To the church (assembly) of God which is in Corinth to those consecrated and purified and made holy in Christ Jesus [who are] selected and called to be saints (God's people) together with all those who in any place call upon and give honor to the name of our Lord Jesus Christ both their Lord and ours:
1 Corinthians,1,3,Grace (favor and spiritual blessing) be to you and [heart] peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians,1,4,I thank my God at all times for you because of the grace (the favor and spiritual blessing) of God which was bestowed on you in Christ Jesus
1 Corinthians,1,5,[So] that in Him in every respect you were enriched in full power and readiness of speech [to speak of your faith] and complete knowledge and illumination [to give you full insight into its meaning].
1 Corinthians,1,6,In this way [our] witnessing concerning Christ (the Messiah) was so confirmed and established and made sure in you
1 Corinthians,1,7,That you are not [consciously] falling behind or lacking in any special spiritual endowment or Christian grace [ the reception of which is due to the power of divine grace operating in your souls by the Holy Spirit] while you wait and watch [constantly living in hope] for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and [His] being made visible to all.
1 Corinthians,1,8,And He will establish you to the end [keep you steadfast give you strength and guarantee your vindication; He will be your warrant against all accusation or indictment so that you will be] guiltless and irreproachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah).
1 Corinthians,1,9,God is faithful (reliable trustworthy and therefore ever true to His promise and He can be depended on); by Him you were called into companionship and participation with His Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
1 Corinthians,1,10,But I urge and entreat you brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that all of you be in perfect harmony and full agreement in what you say and that there be no dissensions or factions or divisions among you but that you be perfectly united in your common understanding and in your opinions and judgments.
1 Corinthians,1,11,For it has been made clear to me my brethren by those of Chloe's household that there are contentions and wrangling and factions among you.
1 Corinthians,1,12,What I mean is this that each one of you [either] says I belong to Paul or I belong to Apollos or I belong to Cephas (Peter) or I belong to Christ.
1 Corinthians,1,13,Is Christ (the Messiah) divided into parts? Was Paul crucified on behalf of you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?
1 Corinthians,1,14,I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius
1 Corinthians,1,15,Lest anyone should say that I baptized in my own name.
1 Corinthians,1,16,[Yes] I did baptize the household of Stephanas also. More than these I do not remember that I baptized anyone.
1 Corinthians,1,17,For Christ (the Messiah) sent me out not to baptize but [to evangelize by] preaching the glad tidings (the Gospel) and that not with verbal eloquence lest the cross of Christ should be deprived of force and emptied of its power and rendered vain (fruitless void of value and of no effect).
1 Corinthians,1,18,For the story and message of the cross is sheer absurdity and folly to those who are perishing and on their way to perdition but to us who are being saved it is the [manifestation of] the power of God.
1 Corinthians,1,19,For it is written I will baffle and render useless and destroy the learning of the learned and the philosophy of the philosophers and the cleverness of the clever and the discernment of the discerning; I will frustrate and nullify [them] and bring [them] to nothing.
1 Corinthians,1,20,Where is the wise man (the philosopher)? Where is the scribe (the scholar)? Where is the investigator (the logician the debater) of this present time and age? Has not God shown up the nonsense and the folly of this world's wisdom?
1 Corinthians,1,21,For when the world with all its earthly wisdom failed to perceive and recognize and know God by means of its own philosophy God in His wisdom was pleased through the foolishness of preaching [salvation procured by Christ and to be had through Him] to save those who believed (who clung to and trusted in and relied on Him).
1 Corinthians,1,22,For while Jews [demandingly] ask for signs and miracles and Greeks pursue philosophy and wisdom
1 Corinthians,1,23,We preach Christ (the Messiah) crucified [preaching which] to the Jews is a scandal and an offensive stumbling block [that springs a snare or trap] and to the Gentiles it is absurd and utterly unphilosophical nonsense.
1 Corinthians,1,24,But to those who are called whether Jew or Greek (Gentile) Christ [is] the Power of God and the Wisdom of God.
1 Corinthians,1,25,[This is] because the foolish thing [that has its source in] God is wiser than men and the weak thing [that springs] from God is stronger than men.
1 Corinthians,1,26,For [simply] consider your own call brethren; not many [of you were considered to be] wise according to human estimates and standards not many influential and powerful not many of high and noble birth.
1 Corinthians,1,27,[No] for God selected (deliberately chose) what in the world is foolish to put the wise to shame and what the world calls weak to put the strong to shame.
1 Corinthians,1,28,And God also selected (deliberately chose) what in the world is lowborn and insignificant and branded and treated with contempt even the things that are nothing that He might depose and bring to nothing the things that are
1 Corinthians,1,29,So that no mortal man should [have pretense for glorying and] boast in the presence of God.
1 Corinthians,1,30,But it is from Him that you have your life in Christ Jesus Whom God made our Wisdom from God [revealed to us a knowledge of the divine plan of salvation previously hidden manifesting itself as] our Righteousness [thus making us upright and putting us in right standing with God] and our Consecration [making us pure and holy] and our Redemption [providing our ransom from eternal penalty for sin].
1 Corinthians,1,31,So then as it is written Let him who boasts and proudly rejoices and glories boast and proudly rejoice and glory in the Lord.
1 Corinthians,2,1,AS FOR myself brethren when I came to you I did not come proclaiming to you the testimony and evidence or mystery and secret of God [concerning what He has done through Christ for the salvation of men] in lofty words of eloquence or human philosophy and wisdom;
1 Corinthians,2,2,For I resolved to know nothing (to be acquainted with nothing to make a display of the knowledge of nothing and to be conscious of nothing) among you except Jesus Christ (the Messiah) and Him crucified.
1 Corinthians,2,3,And I was in ( passed into a state of) weakness and fear (dread) and great trembling [ after I had come] among you.
1 Corinthians,2,4,And my language and my message were not set forth in persuasive (enticing and plausible) words of wisdom but they were in demonstration of the [Holy] Spirit and power [ a proof by the Spirit and power of God operating on me and stirring in the minds of my hearers the most holy emotions and thus persuading them]
1 Corinthians,2,5,So that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men (human philosophy) but in the power of God.
1 Corinthians,2,6,Yet when we are among the full-grown (spiritually mature Christians who are ripe in understanding) we do impart a [higher] wisdom (the knowledge of the divine plan previously hidden); but it is indeed not a wisdom of this present age or of this world nor of the leaders and rulers of this age who are being brought to nothing and are doomed to pass away.
1 Corinthians,2,7,But rather what we are setting forth is a wisdom of God once hidden [from the human understanding] and now revealed to us by God--[that wisdom] which God devised and decreed before the ages for our glorification [to lift us into the glory of His presence].
1 Corinthians,2,8,None of the rulers of this age or world perceived and recognized and understood this for if they had they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.
1 Corinthians,2,9,But on the contrary as the Scripture says What eye has not seen and ear has not heard and has not entered into the heart of man [all that] God has prepared (made and keeps ready) for those who love Him [ who hold Him in affectionate reverence promptly obeying Him and gratefully recognizing the benefits He has bestowed].
1 Corinthians,2,10,Yet to us God has unveiled and revealed them by and through His Spirit for the [Holy] Spirit searches diligently exploring and examining everything even sounding the profound and bottomless things of God [the divine counsels and things hidden and beyond man's scrutiny].
1 Corinthians,2,11,For what person perceives (knows and understands) what passes through a man's thoughts except the man's own spirit within him? Just so no one discerns (comes to know and comprehend) the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.
1 Corinthians,2,12,Now we have not received the spirit [that belongs to] the world but the [Holy] Spirit Who is from God [given to us] that we might realize and comprehend and appreciate the gifts [of divine favor and blessing so freely and lavishly] bestowed on us by God.
1 Corinthians,2,13,And we are setting these truths forth in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the [Holy] Spirit combining and interpreting spiritual truths with spiritual language [to those who possess the Holy Spirit].
1 Corinthians,2,14,But the natural nonspiritual man does not accept or welcome or admit into his heart the gifts and teachings and revelations of the Spirit of God for they are folly (meaningless nonsense) to him; and he is incapable of knowing them [of progressively recognizing understanding and becoming better acquainted with them] because they are spiritually discerned and estimated and appreciated.
1 Corinthians,2,15,But the spiritual man tries all things [he examines investigates inquires into questions and discerns all things] yet is himself to be put on trial and judged by no one [he can read the meaning of everything but no one can properly discern or appraise or get an insight into him].
1 Corinthians,2,16,For who has known or understood the mind (the counsels and purposes) of the Lord so as to guide and instruct Him and give Him knowledge? But we have the mind of Christ (the Messiah) and do hold the thoughts (feelings and purposes) of His heart.
1 Corinthians,3,1,HOWEVER BRETHREN I could not talk to you as to spiritual [men] but as to nonspiritual [men of the flesh in whom the carnal nature predominates] as to mere infants [in the new life] in Christ [ unable to talk yet!]
1 Corinthians,3,2,I fed you with milk not solid food for you were not yet strong enough [to be ready for it]; but even yet you are not strong enough [to be ready for it]
1 Corinthians,3,3,For you are still [unspiritual having the nature] of the flesh [under the control of ordinary impulses]. For as long as [there are] envying and jealousy and wrangling and factions among you are you not unspiritual and of the flesh behaving yourselves after a human standard and like mere (unchanged) men?
1 Corinthians,3,4,For when one says I belong to Paul and another I belong to Apollos are you not [proving yourselves] ordinary (unchanged) men?
1 Corinthians,3,5,What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Ministering servants [not heads of parties] through whom you believed even as the Lord appointed to each his task:
1 Corinthians,3,6,I planted Apollos watered but God [all the while] was making it grow and [He] gave the increase.
1 Corinthians,3,7,So neither he who plants is anything nor he who waters but [only] God Who makes it grow and become greater.
1 Corinthians,3,8,He who plants and he who waters are equal (one in aim of the same importance and esteem) yet each shall receive his own reward (wages) according to his own labor.
1 Corinthians,3,9,For we are fellow workmen (joint promoters laborers together) with and for God; you are God's garden and vineyard and field under cultivation [you are] God's building.
1 Corinthians,3,10,According to the grace (the special endowment for my task) of God bestowed on me like a skillful architect and master builder I laid [the] foundation and now another [man] is building upon it. But let each [man] be careful how he builds upon it
1 Corinthians,3,11,For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is [already] laid which is Jesus Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One).
1 Corinthians,3,12,But if anyone builds upon the Foundation whether it be with gold silver precious stones wood hay straw
1 Corinthians,3,13,The work of each [one] will become [plainly openly] known (shown for what it is); for the day [of Christ] will disclose and declare it because it will be revealed with fire and the fire will test and critically appraise the character and worth of the work each person has done.
1 Corinthians,3,14,If the work which any person has built on this Foundation [any product of his efforts whatever] survives [this test] he will get his reward.
1 Corinthians,3,15,But if any person's work is burned up [under the test] he will suffer the loss [of it all losing his reward] though he himself will be saved but only as [one who has passed] through fire.
1 Corinthians,3,16,Do you not discern and understand that you [the whole church at Corinth] are God's temple (His sanctuary) and that God's Spirit has His permanent dwelling in you [to be at home in you collectively as a church and also individually]?
1 Corinthians,3,17,If anyone does hurt to God's temple or corrupts it [ with false doctrines] or destroys it God will do hurt to him and bring him to the corruption of death and destroy him. For the temple of God is holy (sacred to Him) and that [temple] you [ the believing church and its individual believers] are.
1 Corinthians,3,18,Let no person deceive himself. If anyone among you supposes that he is wise in this age let him become a fool [let him discard his worldly discernment and recognize himself as dull stupid and foolish without true learning and scholarship] that he may become [really] wise.
1 Corinthians,3,19,For this world's wisdom is foolishness (absurdity and stupidity) with God for it is written He lays hold of the wise in their [own] craftiness;
1 Corinthians,3,20,And again The Lord knows the thoughts and reasonings of the [humanly] wise and recognizes how futile they are.
1 Corinthians,3,21,So let no one exult proudly concerning men [boasting of having this or that man as a leader] for all things are yours
1 Corinthians,3,22,Whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas (Peter) or the universe or life or death or the immediate and threatening present or the [subsequent and uncertain] future--all are yours
1 Corinthians,3,23,And you are Christ's and Christ is God's.
1 Corinthians,4,1,SO THEN let us [apostles] be looked upon as ministering servants of Christ and stewards (trustees) of the mysteries (the secret purposes) of God.
1 Corinthians,4,2,Moreover it is [essentially] required of stewards that a man should be found faithful [proving himself worthy of trust].
1 Corinthians,4,3,But [as for me personally] it matters very little to me that I should be put on trial by you [on this point] and that you or any other human tribunal should investigate and question and cross-question me. I do not even put myself on trial and judge myself.
1 Corinthians,4,4,I am not conscious of anything against myself and I feel blameless; but I am not vindicated and acquitted before God on that account. It is the Lord [Himself] Who examines and judges me.
1 Corinthians,4,5,So do not make any hasty or premature judgments before the time when the Lord comes [again] for He will both bring to light the secret things that are [now hidden] in darkness and disclose and expose the [secret] aims (motives and purposes) of hearts. Then every man will receive his [due] commendation from God.
1 Corinthians,4,6,Now I have applied all this [about parties and factions] to myself and Apollos for your sakes brethren so that from what I have said of us [as illustrations] you may learn [to think of men in accordance with Scripture and] not to go beyond that which is written that none of you may be puffed up and inflated with pride and boast in favor of one [minister and teacher] against another.
1 Corinthians,4,7,For who separates you from the others [as a faction leader]? [Who makes you superior and sets you apart from another giving you the preeminence?] What have you that was not given to you? If then you received it [from someone] why do you boast as if you had not received [but had gained it by your own efforts]?
1 Corinthians,4,8,[ You behave as if] you are already filled and think you have enough [you are full and content feeling no need of anything more]! Already you have become rich [in spiritual gifts and graces]! [Without any counsel or instruction from us in your conceit] you have ascended your thrones and come into your kingdom without including us! And would that it were true and that you did reign so that we might be sharing the kingdom with you!
1 Corinthians,4,9,For it seems to me that God has made an exhibit of us apostles exposing us to view last [of all like men in a triumphal procession who are] sentenced to death [and displayed at the end of the line]. For we have become a spectacle to the world [a show in the world's amphitheater] with both men and angels [as spectators].
1 Corinthians,4,10,We are [looked upon as] fools on account of Christ and for His sake but you are [supposedly] so amazingly wise and prudent in Christ! We are weak but you are [so very] strong! You are highly esteemed but we are in disrepute and contempt!
1 Corinthians,4,11,To this hour we have gone both hungry and thirsty; we [ habitually] wear but one undergarment [and shiver in the cold]; we are roughly knocked about and wander around homeless.
1 Corinthians,4,12,And we still toil unto weariness [for our living] working hard with our own hands. When men revile us [ wound us with an accursed sting] we bless them. When we are persecuted we take it patiently and endure it.
1 Corinthians,4,13,When we are slandered and defamed we [try to] answer softly and bring comfort. We have been made and are now the rubbish and filth of the world [the offscouring of all things the scum of the earth].
1 Corinthians,4,14,I do not write this to shame you but to warn and counsel you as my beloved children.
1 Corinthians,4,15,After all though you should have ten thousand teachers (guides to direct you) in Christ yet you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the glad tidings (the Gospel).
1 Corinthians,4,16,So I urge and implore you be imitators of me.
1 Corinthians,4,17,For this very cause I sent to you Timothy who is my beloved and trustworthy child in the Lord who will recall to your minds my methods of proceeding and course of conduct and way of life in Christ such as I teach everywhere in each of the churches.
1 Corinthians,4,18,Some of you have become conceited and arrogant and pretentious counting on my not coming to you.
1 Corinthians,4,19,But I will come to you [and] shortly if the Lord is willing and then I will perceive and understand not what the talk of these puffed up and arrogant spirits amount to but their force ( the moral power and excellence of soul they really possess).
1 Corinthians,4,20,For the kingdom of God consists of and is based on not talk but power ( moral power and excellence of soul).
1 Corinthians,4,21,Now which do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a rod of correction or with love and in a spirit of gentleness?
1 Corinthians,5,1,IT IS actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you impurity of a sort that is condemned and does not occur even among the heathen; for a man has [his own] father's wife.
1 Corinthians,5,2,And you are proud and arrogant! And you ought rather to mourn (bow in sorrow and in shame) until the person who has done this [shameful] thing is removed from your fellowship and your midst!
1 Corinthians,5,3,As for my attitude though I am absent [from you] in body I am present in spirit and I have already decided and passed judgment as if actually present
1 Corinthians,5,4,In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ on the man who has committed such a deed. When you and my own spirit are met together with the power of our Lord Jesus
1 Corinthians,5,5,You are to deliver this man over to Satan for physical discipline [to destroy carnal lusts which prompted him to incest] that [his] spirit may [yet] be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
1 Corinthians,5,6,[About the condition of your church] your boasting is not good [indeed it is most unseemly and entirely out of place]. Do you not know that [just] a little leaven will ferment the whole lump [of dough]?
1 Corinthians,5,7,Purge (clean out) the old leaven that you may be fresh (new) dough still uncontaminated [as you are] for Christ our Passover [Lamb] has been sacrificed.
1 Corinthians,5,8,Therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven nor with leaven of vice and malice and wickedness but with the unleavened [bread] of purity (nobility honor) and sincerity and [unadulterated] truth.
1 Corinthians,5,9,I wrote you in my [previous] letter not to associate [closely and habitually] with unchaste (impure) people--
1 Corinthians,5,10,Not [meaning of course that you must] altogether shun the immoral people of this world or the greedy graspers and cheats and thieves or idolaters since otherwise you would need to get out of the world and human society altogether!
1 Corinthians,5,11,But now I write to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of [Christian] brother if he is known to be guilty of immorality or greed or is an idolater [whose soul is devoted to any object that usurps the place of God] or is a person with a foul tongue [railing abusing reviling slandering] or is a drunkard or a swindler or a robber. [No] you must not so much as eat with such a person.
1 Corinthians,5,12,What [business] of mine is it and what right have I to judge outsiders? Is it not those inside [the church] upon whom you are to pass disciplinary judgment [passing censuring sentence on them as the facts require]?
1 Corinthians,5,13,God alone sits in judgment on those who are outside. Drive out that wicked one from among you [expel him from your church].
1 Corinthians,6,1,DOES ANY of you dare when he has a matter of complaint against another [brother] to go to law before unrighteous men [men neither upright nor right with God laying it before them] instead of before the saints (the people of God)?
1 Corinthians,6,2,Do you not know that the saints (the believers) will [one day] judge and govern the world? And if the world [itself] is to be judged and ruled by you are you unworthy and incompetent to try [such petty matters] of the smallest courts of justice?
1 Corinthians,6,3,Do you not know also that we [Christians] are to judge the [very] angels and pronounce opinion between right and wrong [for them]? How much more then [as to] matters pertaining to this world and of this life only!
1 Corinthians,6,4,If then you do have such cases of everyday life to decide why do you appoint [as judges to lay them before] those who [from the standpoint] of the church count for least and are without standing?
1 Corinthians,6,5,I say this to move you to shame. Can it be that there really is not one man among you who [in action is governed by piety and integrity and] is wise and competent enough to decide [the private grievances disputes and quarrels] between members of the brotherhood
1 Corinthians,6,6,But brother goes to law against brother and that before [Gentile judges who are] unbelievers [without faith or trust in the Gospel of Christ]?
1 Corinthians,6,7,Why the very fact of your having lawsuits with one another at all is a defect (a defeat an evidence of positive moral loss for you). Why not rather let yourselves suffer wrong and be deprived of what is your due? Why not rather be cheated (defrauded and robbed)?
1 Corinthians,6,8,But [instead it is you] yourselves who wrong and defraud and that even your own brethren [by so treating them]!
1 Corinthians,6,9,Do you not know that the unrighteous and the wrongdoers will not inherit or have any share in the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived (misled): neither the impure and immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor those who participate in homosexuality
1 Corinthians,6,10,Nor cheats (swindlers and thieves) nor greedy graspers nor drunkards nor foulmouthed revilers and slanderers nor extortioners and robbers will inherit or have any share in the kingdom of God.
1 Corinthians,6,11,And such some of you were [once]. But you were washed clean (purified by a complete atonement for sin and made free from the guilt of sin) and you were consecrated (set apart hallowed) and you were justified [pronounced righteous by trusting] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the [Holy] Spirit of our God.
1 Corinthians,6,12,Everything is permissible (allowable and lawful) for me; but not all things are helpful (good for me to do expedient and profitable when considered with other things). Everything is lawful for me but I will not become the slave of anything or be brought under its power.
1 Corinthians,6,13,Food [is intended] for the stomach and the stomach for food but God will finally end [the functions of] both and bring them to nothing. The body is not intended for sexual immorality but [is intended] for the Lord and the Lord [is intended] for the body [ to save sanctify and raise it again].
1 Corinthians,6,14,And God both raised the Lord to life and will also raise us up by His power.
1 Corinthians,6,15,Do you not see and know that your bodies are members (bodily parts) of Christ (the Messiah)? Am I therefore to take the parts of Christ and make [them] parts of a prostitute? Never! Never!
1 Corinthians,6,16,Or do you not know and realize that when a man joins himself to a prostitute he becomes one body with her? The two it is written shall become one flesh.
1 Corinthians,6,17,But the person who is united to the Lord becomes one spirit with Him.
1 Corinthians,6,18,Shun immorality and all sexual looseness [flee from impurity in thought word or deed]. Any other sin which a man commits is one outside the body but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.
1 Corinthians,6,19,Do you not know that your body is the temple (the very sanctuary) of the Holy Spirit Who lives within you Whom you have received [as a Gift] from God? You are not your own
1 Corinthians,6,20,You were bought with a price [purchased with a preciousness and paid for made His own]. So then honor God and bring glory to Him in your body.
1 Corinthians,7,1,NOW AS to the matters of which you wrote me. It is well [and by that I mean advantageous expedient profitable and wholesome] for a man not to touch a woman [to cohabit with her] but to remain unmarried.
1 Corinthians,7,2,But because of the temptation to impurity and to avoid immorality let each [man] have his own wife and let each [woman] have her own husband.
1 Corinthians,7,3,The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights (goodwill kindness and what is due her as his wife) and likewise the wife to her husband.
1 Corinthians,7,4,For the wife does not have [exclusive] authority and control over her own body but the husband [has his rights]; likewise also the husband does not have [exclusive] authority and control over his body but the wife [has her rights].
1 Corinthians,7,5,Do not refuse and deprive and defraud each other [of your due marital rights] except perhaps by mutual consent for a time so that you may devote yourselves unhindered to prayer. But afterwards resume marital relations lest Satan tempt you [to sin] through your lack of restraint of sexual desire.
1 Corinthians,7,6,But I am saying this more as a matter of permission and concession not as a command or regulation.
1 Corinthians,7,7,I wish that all men were like I myself am [in this matter of self-control]. But each has his own special gift from God one of this kind and one of another.
1 Corinthians,7,8,But to the unmarried people and to the widows I declare that it is well (good advantageous expedient and wholesome) for them to remain [single] even as I do.
1 Corinthians,7,9,But if they have not self-control (restraint of their passions) they should marry. For it is better to marry than to be aflame [with passion and tortured continually with ungratified desire].
1 Corinthians,7,10,But to the married people I give charge--not I but the Lord--that the wife is not to separate from her husband.
1 Corinthians,7,11,But if she does [separate from and divorce him] let her remain single or else be reconciled to her husband. And [I charge] the husband [also] that he should not put away or divorce his wife.
1 Corinthians,7,12,To the rest I declare--I not the Lord [for Jesus did not discuss this]--that if any brother has a wife who does not believe [in Christ] and she consents to live with him he should not leave or divorce her.
1 Corinthians,7,13,And if any woman has an unbelieving husband and he consents to live with her she should not leave or divorce him.
1 Corinthians,7,14,For the unbelieving husband is set apart (separated withdrawn from heathen contamination and affiliated with the Christian people) by union with his consecrated (set-apart) wife and the unbelieving wife is set apart and separated through union with her consecrated husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean (unblessed heathen outside the Christian covenant) but as it is they are prepared for God [pure and clean].
1 Corinthians,7,15,But if the unbelieving partner [actually] leaves let him do so; in such [cases the remaining] brother or sister is not morally bound. But God has called us to peace.
1 Corinthians,7,16,For wife how can you be sure of converting and saving your husband? Husband how can you be sure of converting and saving your wife?
1 Corinthians,7,17,Only let each one [seek to conduct himself and regulate his affairs so as to] lead the life which the Lord has allotted and imparted to him and to which God has invited and summoned him. This is my order in all the churches.
1 Corinthians,7,18,Was anyone at the time of his summons [from God] already circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the evidence of circumcision. Was anyone at the time [God] called him uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised.
1 Corinthians,7,19,For circumcision is nothing and counts for nothing neither does uncircumcision but [what counts is] keeping the commandments of God.
1 Corinthians,7,20,Everyone should remain after God calls him in the station or condition of life in which the summons found him.
1 Corinthians,7,21,Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let that trouble you. But if you are able to gain your freedom avail yourself of the opportunity.
1 Corinthians,7,22,For he who as a slave was summoned in [to union with] the Lord is a freedman of the Lord just so he who was free when he was called is a bond servant of Christ (the Messiah).
1 Corinthians,7,23,You were bought with a price [purchased with a preciousness and paid for by Christ]; then do not yield yourselves up to become [in your own estimation] slaves to men [but consider yourselves slaves to Christ].
1 Corinthians,7,24,So brethren in whatever station or state or condition of life each one was when he was called there let him continue with and close to God.
1 Corinthians,7,25,Now concerning the virgins (the marriageable maidens) I have no command of the Lord but I give my opinion and advice as one who by the Lord's mercy is rendered trustworthy and faithful.
1 Corinthians,7,26,I think then because of the impending distress [that is even now setting in] it is well (expedient profitable and wholesome) for a person to remain as he or she is.
1 Corinthians,7,27,Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife.
1 Corinthians,7,28,But if you do marry you do not sin [in doing so] and if a virgin marries she does not sin [in doing so]. Yet those who marry will have physical and earthly troubles and I would like to spare you that.
1 Corinthians,7,29,I mean brethren the appointed time has been winding down and it has grown very short. From now on let even those who have wives be as if they had none
1 Corinthians,7,30,And those who weep and mourn as though they were not weeping and mourning and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing and those who buy as though they did not possess anything
1 Corinthians,7,31,And those who deal with this world [ overusing the enjoyments of this life] as though they were not absorbed by it and as if they had no dealings with it. For the outward form of this world (the present world order) is passing away.
1 Corinthians,7,32,My desire is to have you free from all anxiety and distressing care. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord--how he may please the Lord;
1 Corinthians,7,33,But the married man is anxious about worldly matters--how he may please his wife--
1 Corinthians,7,34,And he is drawn in diverging directions [his interests are divided and he is distracted from his devotion to God]. And the unmarried woman or girl is concerned and anxious about the matters of the Lord how to be wholly separated and set apart in body and spirit; but the married woman has her cares [centered] in earthly affairs--how she may please her husband.
1 Corinthians,7,35,Now I say this for your own welfare and profit not to put [a halter of] restraint upon you but to promote what is seemly and in good order and to secure your undistracted and undivided devotion to the Lord.
1 Corinthians,7,36,But if any man thinks that he is not acting properly toward and in regard to his virgin [that he is preparing disgrace for her or incurring reproach] in case she is passing the bloom of her youth and if there is need for it let him do what to him seems right; he does not sin; let them marry.
1 Corinthians,7,37,But whoever is firmly established in his heart [strong in mind and purpose] not being forced by necessity but having control over his own will and desire and has resolved this in his heart to keep his own virginity he is doing well.
1 Corinthians,7,38,So also then he [the father] who gives his virgin (his daughter) in marriage does well and he [the father] who does not give [her] in marriage does better.
1 Corinthians,7,39,A wife is bound to her husband by law as long as he lives. If the husband dies she is free to be married to whom she will only [provided that he too is] in the Lord.
1 Corinthians,7,40,But in my opinion [a widow] is happier (more blessed and to be envied) if she does not remarry. And also I think I have the Spirit of God.
1 Corinthians,8,1,NOW ABOUT food offered to idols: of course we know that all of us possess knowledge [concerning these matters. Yet mere] knowledge causes people to be puffed up (to bear themselves loftily and be proud) but love (affection and goodwill and benevolence) edifies and builds up and encourages one to grow [to his full stature].
1 Corinthians,8,2,If anyone imagines that he has come to know and understand much [of divine things without love] he does not yet perceive and recognize and understand as strongly and clearly nor has he become as intimately acquainted with anything as he ought or as is necessary.
1 Corinthians,8,3,But if one loves God truly [ with affectionate reverence prompt obedience and grateful recognition of His blessing] he is known by God [ recognized as worthy of His intimacy and love and he is owned by Him].
1 Corinthians,8,4,In this matter then of eating food offered to idols we know that an idol is nothing (has no real existence) and that there is no God but one.
1 Corinthians,8,5,For although there may be so-called gods whether in heaven or on earth as indeed there are many of them both of gods and of lords and masters
1 Corinthians,8,6,Yet for us there is [only] one God the Father Who is the Source of all things and for Whom we [have life] and one Lord Jesus Christ through and by Whom are all things and through and by Whom we [ourselves exist].
1 Corinthians,8,7,Nevertheless not all [believers] possess this knowledge. But some through being all their lives until now accustomed to [thinking of] idols [as real and living] still consider the food [offered to an idol] as that sacrificed to an [actual] god; and their weak consciences become defiled and injured if they eat [it].
1 Corinthians,8,8,Now food [itself] will not cause our acceptance by God nor commend us to Him. Eating [food offered to idols] gives us no advantage; neither do we come short or become any worse if we do not eat [it].
1 Corinthians,8,9,Only be careful that this power of choice (this permission and liberty to do as you please) which is yours does not [somehow] become a hindrance (cause of stumbling) to the weak or overscrupulous [giving them an impulse to sin].
1 Corinthians,8,10,For suppose someone sees you a man having knowledge [of God with an intelligent view of this subject and] reclining at table in an idol's temple might he not be encouraged and emboldened [to violate his own conscientious scruples] if he is weak and uncertain and eat what [to him] is for the purpose of idol worship?
1 Corinthians,8,11,And so by your enlightenment (your knowledge of spiritual things) this weak man is ruined (is lost and perishes)--the brother for whom Christ (the Messiah) died!
1 Corinthians,8,12,And when you sin against your brethren in this way wounding and damaging their weak conscience you sin against Christ.
1 Corinthians,8,13,Therefore if [my eating a] food is a cause of my brother's falling or of hindering [his spiritual advancement] I will not eat [such] flesh forever lest I cause my brother to be tripped up and fall and to be offended.
1 Corinthians,9,1,AM I not an apostle (a special messenger)? Am I not free (unrestrained and exempt from any obligation)? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you [yourselves] not [the product and proof of] my workmanship in the Lord?
1 Corinthians,9,2,Even if I am not considered an apostle (a special messenger) by others at least I am one to you; for you are the seal (the certificate the living evidence) of my apostleship in the Lord [confirming and authenticating it].
1 Corinthians,9,3,This is my [real ground of] defense (my vindication of myself) to those who would put me on trial and cross-examine me.
1 Corinthians,9,4,Have we not the right to our food and drink [at the expense of the churches]?
1 Corinthians,9,5,Have we not the right also to take along with us a Christian sister as wife as do the other apostles and the Lord's brothers and Cephas (Peter)?
1 Corinthians,9,6,Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from doing manual labor for a livelihood [in order to go about the work of the ministry]?
1 Corinthians,9,7,[Consider this:] What soldier at any time serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat any of the fruit of it? Who tends a flock and does not partake of the milk of the flock?
1 Corinthians,9,8,Do I say this only on human authority and as a man reasons? Does not the Law endorse the same principle?
1 Corinthians,9,9,For in the Law of Moses it is written You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the corn. Is it [only] for oxen that God cares?
1 Corinthians,9,10,Or does He speak certainly and entirely for our sakes? [Assuredly] it is written for our sakes because the plowman ought to plow in hope and the thresher ought to thresh in expectation of partaking of the harvest.
1 Corinthians,9,11,If we have sown [the seed of] spiritual good among you [is it too] much if we reap from your material benefits?
1 Corinthians,9,12,If others share in this rightful claim upon you do not we [have a still better and greater claim]? However we have never exercised this right but we endure everything rather than put a hindrance in the way [of the spread] of the good news (the Gospel) of Christ.
1 Corinthians,9,13,Do you not know that those men who are employed in the services of the temple get their food from the temple? And that those who tend the altar share with the altar [in the offerings brought]?
1 Corinthians,9,14,[On the same principle] the Lord directed that those who publish the good news (the Gospel) should live (get their maintenance) by the Gospel.
1 Corinthians,9,15,But I have not made use of any of these privileges nor am I writing this [to suggest] that any such provision be made for me [now]. For it would be better for me to die than to have anyone make void and deprive me of my [ground for] glorifying [in this matter].
1 Corinthians,9,16,For if I [merely] preach the Gospel that gives me no reason to boast for I feel compelled of necessity to do it. Woe is me if I do not preach the glad tidings (the Gospel)!
1 Corinthians,9,17,For if I do this work of my own free will then I have my pay (my reward); but if it is not of my own will but is done reluctantly and under compulsion I am [still] entrusted with a [sacred] trusteeship and commission.
1 Corinthians,9,18,What then is the [actual] reward that I get? Just this: that in my preaching the good news (the Gospel) I may offer it [absolutely] free of expense [to anybody] not taking advantage of my rights and privileges [as a preacher] of the Gospel.
1 Corinthians,9,19,For although I am free in every way from anyone's control I have made myself a bond servant to everyone so that I might gain the more [for Christ].
1 Corinthians,9,20,To the Jews I became as a Jew that I might win Jews; to men under the Law [I became] as one under the Law though not myself being under the Law that I might win those under the Law.
1 Corinthians,9,21,To those without (outside) law I became as one without law not that I am without the law of God and lawless toward Him but that I am [especially keeping] within and committed to the law of Christ that I might win those who are without law.
1 Corinthians,9,22,To the weak (wanting in discernment) I have become weak (wanting in discernment) that I might win the weak and overscrupulous. I have [in short] become all things to all men that I might by all means (at all costs and in any and every way) save some [by winning them to faith in Jesus Christ].
1 Corinthians,9,23,And I do this for the sake of the good news (the Gospel) in order that I may become a participator in it and share in its [blessings along with you].
1 Corinthians,9,24,Do you not know that in a race all the runners compete but [only] one receives the prize? So run [your race] that you may lay hold [of the prize] and make it yours.
1 Corinthians,9,25,Now every athlete who goes into training conducts himself temperately and restricts himself in all things. They do it to win a wreath that will soon wither but we [do it to receive a crown of eternal blessedness] that cannot wither.
1 Corinthians,9,26,Therefore I do not run uncertainly (without definite aim). I do not box like one beating the air and striking without an adversary.
1 Corinthians,9,27,But [like a boxer] I buffet my body [handle it roughly discipline it by hardships] and subdue it for fear that after proclaiming to others the Gospel and things pertaining to it I myself should become unfit [not stand the test be unapproved and rejected as a counterfeit].
1 Corinthians,10,1,FOR I do not want you to be ignorant brethren that our forefathers were all under and protected by the cloud [in which God's Presence went before them] and every one of them passed safely through the [Red] Sea
1 Corinthians,10,2,And each one of them [allowed himself also] to be baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea [they were thus brought under obligation to the Law to Moses and to the covenant consecrated and set apart to the service of God];
1 Corinthians,10,3,And all [of them] ate the same spiritual (supernaturally given) food
1 Corinthians,10,4,And they all drank the same spiritual (supernaturally given) drink. For they drank from a spiritual Rock which followed them [produced by the sole power of God Himself without natural instrumentality] and the Rock was Christ.
1 Corinthians,10,5,Nevertheless God was not pleased with the great majority of them for they were overthrown and strewn down along [the ground] in the wilderness.
1 Corinthians,10,6,Now these things are examples (warnings and admonitions) for us not to desire or crave or covet or lust after evil and carnal things as they did.
1 Corinthians,10,7,Do not be worshipers of false gods as some of them were as it is written The people sat down to eat and drink [the sacrifices offered to the golden calf at Horeb] and rose to sport (to dance and give way to jesting and hilarity).
1 Corinthians,10,8,We must not gratify evil desire and indulge in immorality as some of them did--and twenty-three thousand [suddenly] fell dead in a single day!
1 Corinthians,10,9,We should not tempt the Lord [try His patience become a trial to Him critically appraise Him and exploit His goodness] as some of them did--and were killed by poisonous serpents;
1 Corinthians,10,10,Nor discontentedly complain as some of them did--and were put out of the way entirely by the destroyer (death).
1 Corinthians,10,11,Now these things befell them by way of a figure [as an example and warning to us]; they were written to admonish and fit us for right action by good instruction we in whose days the ages have reached their climax (their consummation and concluding period).
1 Corinthians,10,12,Therefore let anyone who thinks he stands [who feels sure that he has a steadfast mind and is standing firm] take heed lest he fall [into sin].
1 Corinthians,10,13,For no temptation (no trial regarded as enticing to sin) [no matter how it comes or where it leads] has overtaken you and laid hold on you that is not common to man [that is no temptation or trial has come to you that is beyond human resistance and that is not adjusted and adapted and belonging to human experience and such as man can bear]. But God is faithful [to His Word and to His compassionate nature] and He [can be trusted] not to let you be tempted and tried and assayed beyond your ability and strength of resistance and power to endure but with the temptation He will [always] also provide the way out (the means of escape to a landing place) that you may be capable and strong and powerful to bear up under it patiently.
1 Corinthians,10,14,Therefore my dearly beloved shun (keep clear away from avoid by flight if need be) any sort of idolatry (of loving or venerating anything more than God).
1 Corinthians,10,15,I am speaking as to intelligent (sensible) men. Think over and make up your minds [for yourselves] about what I say. [I appeal to your reason and your discernment in these matters.]
1 Corinthians,10,16,The cup of blessing [of wine at the Lord's Supper] upon which we ask [God's] blessing does it not mean [that in drinking it] we participate in and share a fellowship (a communion) in the blood of Christ (the Messiah)? The bread which we break does it not mean [that in eating it] we participate in and share a fellowship (a communion) in the body of Christ?
1 Corinthians,10,17,For we [no matter how] numerous we are are one body because we all partake of the one Bread [the One Whom the communion bread represents].
1 Corinthians,10,18,Consider those [physically] people of Israel. Are not those who eat the sacrifices partners of the altar [united in their worship of the same God]?
1 Corinthians,10,19,What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is [intrinsically changed by the fact and amounts to] anything or that an idol itself is a [living] thing?
1 Corinthians,10,20,No I am suggesting that what the pagans sacrifice they offer [in effect] to demons (to evil spiritual powers) and not to God [at all]. I do not want you to fellowship and be partners with diabolical spirits [by eating at their feasts].
1 Corinthians,10,21,You cannot drink the Lord's cup and the demons' cup. You cannot partake of the Lord's table and the demons' table.
1 Corinthians,10,22,Shall we thus provoke the Lord to jealousy and anger and indignation? Are we stronger than He [that we should defy Him]?
1 Corinthians,10,23,All things are legitimate [permissible--and we are free to do anything we please] but not all things are helpful (expedient profitable and wholesome). All things are legitimate but not all things are constructive [to character] and edifying [to spiritual life].
1 Corinthians,10,24,Let no one then seek his own good and advantage and profit but [rather] each one of the other [let him seek the welfare of his neighbor].
1 Corinthians,10,25,[As to meat offered to idols] eat anything that is sold in the meat market without raising any question or investigating on the grounds of conscientious scruples
1 Corinthians,10,26,For the [whole] earth is the Lord's and everything that is in it.
1 Corinthians,10,27,In case one of the unbelievers invites you to a meal and you want to go eat whatever is served to you without examining into its source because of conscientious scruples.
1 Corinthians,10,28,But if someone tells you This has been offered in sacrifice to an idol do not eat it out of consideration for the person who informed you and for conscience's sake--
1 Corinthians,10,29,I mean for the sake of his conscience not yours [do not eat it]. For why should another man's scruples apply to me and my liberty of action be determined by his conscience?
1 Corinthians,10,30,If I partake [of my food] with thankfulness why am I accused and spoken evil of because of that for which I give thanks?
1 Corinthians,10,31,So then whether you eat or drink or whatever you may do do all for the honor and glory of God.
1 Corinthians,10,32,Do not let yourselves be [hindrances by giving] an offense to the Jews or to the Greeks or to the church of God [ do not lead others into sin by your mode of life];
1 Corinthians,10,33,Just as I myself strive to please [to accommodate myself to the opinions desires and interests of others adapting myself to] all men in everything I do not aiming at or considering my own profit and advantage but that of the many in order that they may be saved.
1 Corinthians,11,1,PATTERN YOURSELVES after me [follow my example] as I imitate and follow Christ (the Messiah).
1 Corinthians,11,2,I appreciate and commend you because you always remember me in everything and keep firm possession of the traditions (the substance of my instructions) just as I have [verbally] passed them on to you.
1 Corinthians,11,3,But I want you to know and realize that Christ is the Head of every man the head of a woman is her husband and the Head of Christ is God.
1 Corinthians,11,4,Any man who prays or prophesies (teaches refutes reproves admonishes and comforts) with his head covered dishonors his Head (Christ).
1 Corinthians,11,5,And any woman who [publicly] prays or prophesies (teaches refutes reproves admonishes or comforts) when she is bareheaded dishonors her head (her husband); it is the same as [if her head were] shaved.
1 Corinthians,11,6,For if a woman will not wear [a head] covering then she should cut off her hair too; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her head shorn or shaven let her cover [her head].
1 Corinthians,11,7,For a man ought not to wear anything on his head [in church] for he is the image and [reflected] glory of God [ his function of government reflects the majesty of the divine Rule]; but woman is [the expression of] man's glory (majesty preeminence).
1 Corinthians,11,8,For man was not [created] from woman but woman from man;
1 Corinthians,11,9,Neither was man created on account of or for the benefit of woman but woman on account of and for the benefit of man.
1 Corinthians,11,10,Therefore she should [be subject to his authority and should] have a covering on her head [as a token a symbol of her submission to authority that she may show reverence as do] the angels [and not displease them].
1 Corinthians,11,11,Nevertheless in [the plan of] the Lord and from His point of view woman is not apart from and independent of man nor is man aloof from and independent of woman;
1 Corinthians,11,12,For as woman was made from man even so man is also born of woman; and all [whether male or female go forth] from God [as their Author].
1 Corinthians,11,13,Consider for yourselves; is it proper and decent [according to your customs] for a woman to offer prayer to God [publicly] with her head uncovered?
1 Corinthians,11,14,Does not the native sense of propriety (experience common sense reason) itself teach you that for a man to wear long hair is a dishonor [humiliating and degrading] to him
1 Corinthians,11,15,But if a woman has long hair it is her ornament and glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering.
1 Corinthians,11,16,Now if anyone is disposed to be argumentative and contentious about this we hold to and recognize no other custom [in worship] than this nor do the churches of God generally.
1 Corinthians,11,17,But in what I instruct [you] next I do not commend [you] because when you meet together it is not for the better but for the worse.
1 Corinthians,11,18,For in the first place when you assemble as a congregation I hear that there are cliques (divisions and factions) among you; and I in part believe it
1 Corinthians,11,19,For doubtless there have to be factions or parties among you in order that they who are genuine and of approved fitness may become evident and plainly recognized among you.
1 Corinthians,11,20,So when you gather for your meetings it is not the supper instituted by the Lord that you eat
1 Corinthians,11,21,For in eating each one [hurries] to get his own supper first [not waiting for the poor] and one goes hungry while another gets drunk.
1 Corinthians,11,22,What! Do you have no houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and mean to show contempt for it while you humiliate those who are poor (have no homes and have brought no food)? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? No [most certainly] I will not!
1 Corinthians,11,23,For I received from the Lord Himself that which I passed on to you [it was given to me personally] that the Lord Jesus on the night when He was treacherously delivered up and while His betrayal was in progress took bread
1 Corinthians,11,24,And when He had given thanks He broke [it] and said Take eat. This is My body which is broken for you. Do this to call Me [affectionately] to remembrance.
1 Corinthians,11,25,Similarly when supper was ended He took the cup also saying This cup is the new covenant [ratified and established] in My blood. Do this as often as you drink [it] to call Me [affectionately] to remembrance.
1 Corinthians,11,26,For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup you are representing and signifying and proclaiming the fact of the Lord's death until He comes [again].
1 Corinthians,11,27,So then whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in a way that is unworthy [of Him] will be guilty of [profaning and sinning against] the body and blood of the Lord.
1 Corinthians,11,28,Let a man [thoroughly] examine himself and [only when he has done] so should he eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
1 Corinthians,11,29,For anyone who eats and drinks without discriminating and recognizing with due appreciation that [it is Christ's] body eats and drinks a sentence (a verdict of judgment) upon himself.
1 Corinthians,11,30,That [careless and unworthy participation] is the reason many of you are weak and sickly and quite enough of you have fallen into the sleep of death.
1 Corinthians,11,31,For if we searchingly examined ourselves [detecting our shortcomings and recognizing our own condition] we should not be judged and penalty decreed [by the divine judgment].
1 Corinthians,11,32,But when we [fall short and] are judged by the Lord we are disciplined and chastened so that we may not [finally] be condemned [to eternal punishment along] with the world.
1 Corinthians,11,33,So then my brothers when you gather together to eat [the Lord's Supper] wait for one another.
1 Corinthians,11,34,If anyone is hungry let him eat at home lest you come together to bring judgment [on yourselves]. About the other matters I will give you directions [personally] when I come.
1 Corinthians,12,1,NOW ABOUT the spiritual gifts (the special endowments of supernatural energy) brethren I do not want you to be misinformed.
1 Corinthians,12,2,You know that when you were heathen you were led off after idols that could not speak [habitually] as impulse directed and whenever the occasion might arise.
1 Corinthians,12,3,Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking under the power and influence of the [Holy] Spirit of God can [ever] say Jesus be cursed! And no one can [really] say Jesus is [my] Lord except by and under the power and influence of the Holy Spirit.
1 Corinthians,12,4,Now there are distinctive varieties and distributions of endowments (gifts extraordinary powers distinguishing certain Christians due to the power of divine grace operating in their souls by the Holy Spirit) and they vary but the [Holy] Spirit remains the same.
1 Corinthians,12,5,And there are distinctive varieties of service and ministration but it is the same Lord [Who is served].
1 Corinthians,12,6,And there are distinctive varieties of operation [of working to accomplish things] but it is the same God Who inspires and energizes them all in all.
1 Corinthians,12,7,But to each one is given the manifestation of the [Holy] Spirit [the evidence the spiritual illumination of the Spirit] for good and profit.
1 Corinthians,12,8,To one is given in and through the [Holy] Spirit [the power to speak] a message of wisdom and to another [the power to express] a word of knowledge and understanding according to the same [Holy] Spirit;
1 Corinthians,12,9,To another [ wonder-working] faith by the same [Holy] Spirit to another the extraordinary powers of healing by the one Spirit;
1 Corinthians,12,10,To another the working of miracles to another prophetic insight ( the gift of interpreting the divine will and purpose); to another the ability to discern and distinguish between [the utterances of true] spirits [and false ones] to another various kinds of [unknown] tongues to another the ability to interpret [such] tongues.
1 Corinthians,12,11,All these [gifts achievements abilities] are inspired and brought to pass by one and the same [Holy] Spirit Who apportions to each person individually [exactly] as He chooses.
1 Corinthians,12,12,For just as the body is a unity and yet has many parts and all the parts though many form [only] one body so it is with Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One).
1 Corinthians,12,13,For by [ means of the personal agency of] one [Holy] Spirit we were all whether Jews or Greeks slaves or free baptized [and by baptism united together] into one body and all made to drink of one [Holy] Spirit.
1 Corinthians,12,14,For the body does not consist of one limb or organ but of many.
1 Corinthians,12,15,If the foot should say Because I am not the hand I do not belong to the body would it be therefore not [a part] of the body?
1 Corinthians,12,16,If the ear should say Because I am not the eye I do not belong to the body would it be therefore not [a part] of the body?
1 Corinthians,12,17,If the whole body were an eye where [would be the sense of] hearing? If the whole body were an ear where [would be the sense of] smell?
1 Corinthians,12,18,But as it is God has placed and arranged the limbs and organs in the body each [particular one] of them just as He wished and saw fit and with the best adaptation.
1 Corinthians,12,19,But if [the whole] were all a single organ where would the body be?
1 Corinthians,12,20,And now there are [certainly] many limbs and organs but a single body.
1 Corinthians,12,21,And the eye is not able to say to the hand I have no need of you nor again the head to the feet I have no need of you.
1 Corinthians,12,22,But instead there is [absolute] necessity for the parts of the body that are considered the more weak.
1 Corinthians,12,23,And those [parts] of the body which we consider rather ignoble are [the very parts] which we invest with additional honor and our unseemly parts and those unsuitable for exposure are treated with seemliness (modesty and decorum)
1 Corinthians,12,24,Which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so adjusted (mingled harmonized and subtly proportioned the parts of) the whole body giving the greater honor and richer endowment to the inferior parts which lack [apparent importance]
1 Corinthians,12,25,So that there should be no division or discord or lack of adaptation [of the parts of the body to each other] but the members all alike should have a mutual interest in and care for one another.
1 Corinthians,12,26,And if one member suffers all the parts [share] the suffering; if one member is honored all the members [share in] the enjoyment of it.
1 Corinthians,12,27,Now you [collectively] are Christ's body and [individually] you are members of it each part severally and distinct [each with his own place and function].
1 Corinthians,12,28,So God has appointed some in the church [ for His own use]: first apostles (special messengers); second prophets (inspired preachers and expounders); third teachers; then wonder-workers; then those with ability to heal the sick; helpers; administrators; [speakers in] different (unknown) tongues.
1 Corinthians,12,29,Are all apostles (special messengers)? Are all prophets (inspired interpreters of the will and purposes of God)? Are all teachers? Do all have the power of performing miracles?
1 Corinthians,12,30,Do all possess extraordinary powers of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?
1 Corinthians,12,31,But earnestly desire and zealously cultivate the greatest and best gifts and graces (the higher gifts and the choicest graces). And yet I will show you a still more excellent way [one that is better by far and the highest of them all--love].
1 Corinthians,13,1,IF I [can] speak in the tongues of men and [even] of angels but have not love (that reasoning intentional spiritual devotion such as is inspired by God's love for and in us) I am only a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
1 Corinthians,13,2,And if I have prophetic powers ( the gift of interpreting the divine will and purpose) and understand all the secret truths and mysteries and possess all knowledge and if I have [sufficient] faith so that I can remove mountains but have not love (God's love in me) I am nothing (a useless nobody).
1 Corinthians,13,3,Even if I dole out all that I have [to the poor in providing] food and if I surrender my body to be burned or in order that I may glory but have not love (God's love in me) I gain nothing.
1 Corinthians,13,4,Love endures long and is patient and kind; love never is envious nor boils over with jealousy is not boastful or vainglorious does not display itself haughtily.
1 Corinthians,13,5,It is not conceited (arrogant and inflated with pride); it is not rude (unmannerly) and does not act unbecomingly. Love (God's love in us) does not insist on its own rights or its own way for it is not self-seeking; it is not touchy or fretful or resentful; it takes no account of the evil done to it [it pays no attention to a suffered wrong].
1 Corinthians,13,6,It does not rejoice at injustice and unrighteousness but rejoices when right and truth prevail.
1 Corinthians,13,7,Love bears up under anything and everything that comes is ever ready to believe the best of every person its hopes are fadeless under all circumstances and it endures everything [without weakening].
1 Corinthians,13,8,Love never fails [never fades out or becomes obsolete or comes to an end]. As for prophecy ( the gift of interpreting the divine will and purpose) it will be fulfilled and pass away; as for tongues they will be destroyed and cease; as for knowledge it will pass away [it will lose its value and be superseded by truth].
1 Corinthians,13,9,For our knowledge is fragmentary (incomplete and imperfect) and our prophecy (our teaching) is fragmentary (incomplete and imperfect).
1 Corinthians,13,10,But when the complete and perfect (total) comes the incomplete and imperfect will vanish away (become antiquated void and superseded).
1 Corinthians,13,11,When I was a child I talked like a child I thought like a child I reasoned like a child; now that I have become a man I am done with childish ways and have put them aside.
1 Corinthians,13,12,For now we are looking in a mirror that gives only a dim (blurred) reflection [of reality as in a riddle or enigma] but then [when perfection comes] we shall see in reality and face to face! Now I know in part (imperfectly) but then I shall know and understand fully and clearly even in the same manner as I have been fully and clearly known and understood [ by God].
1 Corinthians,13,13,And so faith hope love abide [faith--conviction and belief respecting man's relation to God and divine things; hope--joyful and confident expectation of eternal salvation; love--true affection for God and man growing out of God's love for and in us] these three; but the greatest of these is love.
1 Corinthians,14,1,EAGERLY PURSUE and seek to acquire [this] love [make it your aim your great quest]; and earnestly desire and cultivate the spiritual endowments (gifts) especially that you may prophesy ( interpret the divine will and purpose in inspired preaching and teaching).
1 Corinthians,14,2,For one who speaks in an [unknown] tongue speaks not to men but to God for no one understands or catches his meaning because in the [Holy] Spirit he utters secret truths and hidden things [not obvious to the understanding].
1 Corinthians,14,3,But [on the other hand] the one who prophesies [who interprets the divine will and purpose in inspired preaching and teaching] speaks to men for their upbuilding and constructive spiritual progress and encouragement and consolation.
1 Corinthians,14,4,He who speaks in a [strange] tongue edifies and improves himself but he who prophesies [ interpreting the divine will and purpose and teaching with inspiration] edifies and improves the church and promotes growth [in Christian wisdom piety holiness and happiness].
1 Corinthians,14,5,Now I wish that you might all speak in [unknown] tongues but more especially [I want you] to prophesy (to be inspired to preach and interpret the divine will and purpose). He who prophesies [who is inspired to preach and teach] is greater (more useful and more important) than he who speaks in [unknown] tongues unless he should interpret [what he says] so that the church may be edified and receive good [from it].
1 Corinthians,14,6,Now brethren if I come to you speaking in [unknown] tongues how shall I make it to your advantage unless I speak to you either in revelation (disclosure of God's will to man) in knowledge or in prophecy or in instruction?
1 Corinthians,14,7,If even inanimate musical instruments such as the flute or the harp do not give distinct notes how will anyone [listening] know or understand what is played?
1 Corinthians,14,8,And if the war bugle gives an uncertain (indistinct) call who will prepare for battle?
1 Corinthians,14,9,Just so it is with you; if you in the [unknown] tongue speak words that are not intelligible how will anyone understand what you are saying? For you will be talking into empty space!
1 Corinthians,14,10,There are I suppose all these many [to us unknown] tongues in the world [somewhere] and none is destitute of [its own power of] expression and meaning.
1 Corinthians,14,11,But if I do not know the force and significance of the speech (language) I shall seem to be a foreigner to the one who speaks [to me] and the speaker who addresses [me] will seem a foreigner to me.
1 Corinthians,14,12,So it is with yourselves; since you are so eager and ambitious to possess spiritual endowments and manifestations of the [Holy] Spirit [concentrate on] striving to excel and to abound [in them] in ways that will build up the church.
1 Corinthians,14,13,Therefore the person who speaks in an [unknown] tongue should pray [for the power] to interpret and explain what he says.
1 Corinthians,14,14,For if I pray in an [unknown] tongue my spirit [by the Holy Spirit within me] prays but my mind is unproductive [it bears no fruit and helps nobody].
1 Corinthians,14,15,Then what am I to do? I will pray with my spirit [by the Holy Spirit that is within me] but I will also pray [intelligently] with my mind and understanding; I will sing with my spirit [by the Holy Spirit that is within me] but I will sing [intelligently] with my mind and understanding also.
1 Corinthians,14,16,Otherwise if you bless and render thanks with [your] spirit [ thoroughly aroused by the Holy Spirit] how can anyone in the position of an outsider or he who is not gifted with [interpreting of unknown] tongues say the Amen to your thanksgiving since he does not know what you are saying? [I Chron. 16:36; Ps. 106:48.]
1 Corinthians,14,17,To be sure you may give thanks well (nobly) but the bystander is not edified [it does him no good].
1 Corinthians,14,18,I thank God that I speak in [strange] tongues (languages) more than any of you or all of you put together;
1 Corinthians,14,19,Nevertheless in public worship I would rather say five words with my understanding and intelligently in order to instruct others than ten thousand words in a [strange] tongue (language).
1 Corinthians,14,20,Brethren do not be children [immature] in your thinking; continue to be babes in [matters of] evil but in your minds be mature [men].
1 Corinthians,14,21,It is written in the Law By men of strange languages and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people and not even then will they listen to Me says the Lord.
1 Corinthians,14,22,Thus [unknown] tongues are meant for a [supernatural] sign not for believers but for unbelievers [on the point of believing] while prophecy (inspired preaching and teaching interpreting the divine will and purpose) is not for unbelievers [on the point of believing] but for believers.
1 Corinthians,14,23,Therefore if the whole church assembles and all of you speak in [unknown] tongues and the ungifted and uninitiated or unbelievers come in will they not say that you are demented?
1 Corinthians,14,24,But if all prophesy [giving inspired testimony and interpreting the divine will and purpose] and an unbeliever or untaught outsider comes in he is told of his sin and reproved and convicted and convinced by all and his defects and needs are examined (estimated determined) and he is called to account by all
1 Corinthians,14,25,The secrets of his heart are laid bare; and so falling on [his] face he will worship God declaring that God is among you in very truth.
1 Corinthians,14,26,What then brethren is [the right course]? When you meet together each one has a hymn a teaching a disclosure of special knowledge or information an utterance in a [strange] tongue or an interpretation of it. [But] let everything be constructive and edifying and for the good of all.
1 Corinthians,14,27,If some speak in a [strange] tongue let the number be limited to two or at the most three and each one [taking his] turn and let one interpret and explain [what is said].
1 Corinthians,14,28,But if there is no one to do the interpreting let each of them keep still in church and talk to himself and to God.
1 Corinthians,14,29,So let two or three prophets speak [those inspired to preach or teach] while the rest pay attention and weigh and discern what is said.
1 Corinthians,14,30,But if an inspired revelation comes to another who is sitting by then let the first one be silent.
1 Corinthians,14,31,For in this way you can give testimony [prophesying and thus interpreting the divine will and purpose] one by one so that all may be instructed and all may be stimulated and encouraged;
1 Corinthians,14,32,For the spirits of the prophets (the speakers in tongues) are under the speaker's control [and subject to being silenced as may be necessary]
1 Corinthians,14,33,For He [Who is the source of their prophesying] is not a God of confusion and disorder but of peace and order. As [is the practice] in all the churches of the saints (God's people)
1 Corinthians,14,34,The women should keep quiet in the churches for they are not authorized to speak but should take a secondary and subordinate place just as the Law also says.
1 Corinthians,14,35,But if there is anything they want to learn they should ask their own husbands at home for it is disgraceful for a woman to talk in church [ for her to usurp and exercise authority over men in the church].
1 Corinthians,14,36,What! Did the word of the Lord originate with you [Corinthians] or has it reached only you?
1 Corinthians,14,37,If anyone thinks and claims that he is a prophet [filled with and governed by the Holy Spirit of God and inspired to interpret the divine will and purpose in preaching or teaching] or has any other spiritual endowment let him understand (recognize and acknowledge) that what I am writing to you is a command of the Lord.
1 Corinthians,14,38,But if anyone disregards or does not recognize [ that it is a command of the Lord] he is disregarded and not recognized [he is one whom God knows not].
1 Corinthians,14,39,So [to conclude] my brethren earnestly desire and set your hearts on prophesying (on being inspired to preach and teach and to interpret God's will and purpose) and do not forbid or hinder speaking in [unknown] tongues.
1 Corinthians,14,40,But all things should be done with regard to decency and propriety and in an orderly fashion.
1 Corinthians,15,1,AND NOW let me remind you [since it seems to have escaped you] brethren of the Gospel (the glad tidings of salvation) which I proclaimed to you which you welcomed and accepted and upon which your faith rests
1 Corinthians,15,2,And by which you are saved if you hold fast and keep firmly what I preached to you unless you believed at first without effect and all for nothing.
1 Corinthians,15,3,For I passed on to you first of all what I also had received that Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One) died for our sins in accordance with [what] the Scriptures [foretold]
1 Corinthians,15,4,That He was buried that He arose on the third day as the Scriptures foretold
1 Corinthians,15,5,And [also] that He appeared to Cephas (Peter) then to the Twelve.
1 Corinthians,15,6,Then later He showed Himself to more than five hundred brethren at one time the majority of whom are still alive but some have fallen asleep [in death].
1 Corinthians,15,7,Afterward He was seen by James then by all the apostles (the special messengers)
1 Corinthians,15,8,And last of all He appeared to me also as to one prematurely and born dead [ no better than an unperfected fetus among living men].
1 Corinthians,15,9,For I am the least [worthy] of the apostles who am not fit or deserving to be called an apostle because I once wronged and pursued and molested the church of God [oppressing it with cruelty and violence].
1 Corinthians,15,10,But by the grace (the unmerited favor and blessing) of God I am what I am and His grace toward me was not [found to be] for nothing (fruitless and without effect). In fact I worked harder than all of them [the apostles] though it was not really I but the grace (the unmerited favor and blessing) of God which was with me.
1 Corinthians,15,11,So whether then it was I or they this is what we preach and this is what you believed [what you adhered to trusted in and relied on].
1 Corinthians,15,12,But now if Christ (the Messiah) is preached as raised from the dead how is it that some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
1 Corinthians,15,13,But if there is no resurrection of the dead then Christ has not risen;
1 Corinthians,15,14,And if Christ has not risen then our preaching is in vain [it amounts to nothing] and your faith is devoid of truth and is fruitless (without effect empty imaginary and unfounded).
1 Corinthians,15,15,We are even discovered to be misrepresenting God for we testified of Him that He raised Christ Whom He did not raise in case it is true that the dead are not raised.
1 Corinthians,15,16,For if the dead are not raised then Christ has not been raised;
1 Corinthians,15,17,And if Christ has not been raised your faith is mere delusion [futile fruitless] and you are still in your sins [under the control and penalty of sin];
1 Corinthians,15,18,And further those who have died in [ spiritual fellowship and union with] Christ have perished (are lost)!
1 Corinthians,15,19,If we who are [abiding] in Christ have hope only in this life and that is all then we are of all people most miserable and to be pitied.
1 Corinthians,15,20,But the fact is that Christ (the Messiah) has been raised from the dead and He became the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep [in death].
1 Corinthians,15,21,For since [it was] through a man that death [came into the world it is] also through a Man that the resurrection of the dead [has come].
1 Corinthians,15,22,For just as [because of their union of nature] in Adam all people die so also [by virtue of their union of nature] shall all in Christ be made alive.
1 Corinthians,15,23,But each in his own rank and turn: Christ (the Messiah) [is] the firstfruits then those who are Christ's [own will be resurrected] at His coming.
1 Corinthians,15,24,After that comes the end (the completion) when He delivers over the kingdom to God the Father after rendering inoperative and abolishing every [other] rule and every authority and power.
1 Corinthians,15,25,For [Christ] must be King and reign until He has put all [His] enemies under His feet.
1 Corinthians,15,26,The last enemy to be subdued and abolished is death.
1 Corinthians,15,27,For He [the Father] has put all things in subjection under His [Christ's] feet. But when it says All things are put in subjection [under Him] it is evident that He [Himself] is excepted Who does the subjecting of all things to Him.
1 Corinthians,15,28,However when everything is subjected to Him then the Son Himself will also subject Himself to [the Father] Who put all things under Him so that God may be all in all [be everything to everyone supreme the indwelling and controlling factor of life].
1 Corinthians,15,29,Otherwise what do people mean by being [themselves] baptized in behalf of the dead? If the dead are not raised at all why are people baptized for them?
1 Corinthians,15,30,[For that matter] why do I live [dangerously as I do running such risks that I am] in peril every hour?
1 Corinthians,15,31,[I assure you] by the pride which I have in you in [your fellowship and union with] Christ Jesus our Lord that I die daily [I face death every day and die to self].
1 Corinthians,15,32,What do I gain if merely from the human point of view I fought with [wild] beasts at Ephesus? If the dead are not raised [at all] let us eat and drink for tomorrow we will be dead.
1 Corinthians,15,33,Do not be so deceived and misled! Evil companionships (communion associations) corrupt and deprave good manners and morals and character.
1 Corinthians,15,34,Awake [ from your drunken stupor and return] to sober sense and your right minds and sin no more. For some of you have not the knowledge of God [you are utterly and willfully and disgracefully ignorant and continue to be so lacking the sense of God's presence and all true knowledge of Him]. I say this to your shame.
1 Corinthians,15,35,But someone will say How can the dead be raised? With what [kind of] body will they come forth?
1 Corinthians,15,36,You foolish man! Every time you plant seed you sow something that does not come to life [germinating springing up and growing] unless it dies first.
1 Corinthians,15,37,Nor is the seed you sow then the body which it is going to have [later] but it is a naked kernel perhaps of wheat or some of the rest of the grains.
1 Corinthians,15,38,But God gives to it the body that He plans and sees fit and to each kind of seed a body of its own.
1 Corinthians,15,39,For all flesh is not the same but there is one kind for humans another for beasts another for birds and another for fish.
1 Corinthians,15,40,There are heavenly bodies (sun moon and stars) and there are earthly bodies (men animals and plants) but the beauty and glory of the heavenly bodies is of one kind while the beauty and glory of earthly bodies is a different kind.
1 Corinthians,15,41,The sun is glorious in one way the moon is glorious in another way and the stars are glorious in their own [distinctive] way; for one star differs from and surpasses another in its beauty and brilliance.
1 Corinthians,15,42,So it is with the resurrection of the dead. [The body] that is sown is perishable and decays but [the body] that is resurrected is imperishable (immune to decay immortal).
1 Corinthians,15,43,It is sown in dishonor and humiliation; it is raised in honor and glory. It is sown in infirmity and weakness; it is resurrected in strength and endued with power.
1 Corinthians,15,44,It is sown a natural (physical) body; it is raised a supernatural (a spiritual) body. [As surely as] there is a physical body there is also a spiritual body.
1 Corinthians,15,45,Thus it is written The first man Adam became a living being (an individual personality); the last Adam (Christ) became a life-giving Spirit [restoring the dead to life].
1 Corinthians,15,46,But it is not the spiritual life which came first but the physical and then the spiritual.
1 Corinthians,15,47,The first man [was] from out of earth made of dust (earthly-minded); the second Man [is] the Lord from out of heaven.
1 Corinthians,15,48,Now those who are made of the dust are like him who was first made of the dust (earthly-minded); and as is [the Man] from heaven so also [are those] who are of heaven (heavenly-minded).
1 Corinthians,15,49,And just as we have borne the image [of the man] of dust so shall we and so let us also bear the image [of the Man] of heaven.
1 Corinthians,15,50,But I tell you this brethren flesh and blood cannot [become partakers of eternal salvation and] inherit or share in the kingdom of God; nor does the perishable (that which is decaying) inherit or share in the imperishable (the immortal).
1 Corinthians,15,51,Take notice! I tell you a mystery (a secret truth an event decreed by the hidden purpose or counsel of God). We shall not all fall asleep [in death] but we shall all be changed (transformed)
1 Corinthians,15,52,In a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the [sound of the] last trumpet call. For a trumpet will sound and the dead [in Christ] will be raised imperishable (free and immune from decay) and we shall be changed (transformed).
1 Corinthians,15,53,For this perishable [part of us] must put on the imperishable [nature] and this mortal [part of us this nature that is capable of dying] must put on immortality (freedom from death).
1 Corinthians,15,54,And when this perishable puts on the imperishable and this that was capable of dying puts on freedom from death then shall be fulfilled the Scripture that says Death is swallowed up (utterly vanquished forever) in and unto victory.
1 Corinthians,15,55,O death where is your victory? O death where is your sting?
1 Corinthians,15,56,Now sin is the sting of death and sin exercises its power [upon the soul] through [the abuse of] the Law.
1 Corinthians,15,57,But thanks be to God Who gives us the victory [making us conquerors] through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians,15,58,Therefore my beloved brethren be firm (steadfast) immovable always abounding in the work of the Lord [always being superior excelling doing more than enough in the service of the Lord] knowing and being continually aware that your labor in the Lord is not futile [it is never wasted or to no purpose].
1 Corinthians,16,1,NOW CONCERNING the money contributed for [the relief of] the saints (God's people): you are to do the same as I directed the churches of Galatia to do.
1 Corinthians,16,2,On the first [day] of each week let each one of you [personally] put aside something and save it up as he has prospered [in proportion to what he is given] so that no collections will need to be taken after I come.
1 Corinthians,16,3,And when I arrive I will send on those whom you approve and authorize with credentials to carry your gift [of charity] to Jerusalem.
1 Corinthians,16,4,If it seems worthwhile that I should go too they will accompany me.
1 Corinthians,16,5,After passing through Macedonia I will visit you for I intend [only] to pass through Macedonia;
1 Corinthians,16,6,But it may be that I will stay with you [for a while] perhaps even spend the winter so that you may bring me forward [on my journey] to wherever I may go.
1 Corinthians,16,7,For I am unwilling to see you right now [just] in passing but I hope later to remain for some time with you if the Lord permits.
1 Corinthians,16,8,I will remain in Ephesus [however] until Pentecost
1 Corinthians,16,9,For a wide door of opportunity for effectual [service] has opened to me [there a great and promising one] and [there are] many adversaries.
1 Corinthians,16,10,When Timothy arrives see to it that [you put him at ease so that] he may be fearless among you for he is [devotedly] doing the Lord's work just as I am.
1 Corinthians,16,11,So [see to it that] no one despises him or treats him as if he were of no account or slights him. But send him off [cordially speed him on his way] in peace that he may come to me for I am expecting him [to come along] with the other brethren.
1 Corinthians,16,12,As for our brother Apollos I have urgently encouraged him to visit you with the other brethren but it was not at all his will or God's will that he should go now. He will come when he has opportunity.
1 Corinthians,16,13,Be alert and on your guard; stand firm in your faith ( your conviction respecting man's relationship to God and divine things keeping the trust and holy fervor born of faith and a part of it). Act like men and be courageous; grow in strength!
1 Corinthians,16,14,Let everything you do be done in love (true love to God and man as inspired by God's love for us).
1 Corinthians,16,15,Now brethren you know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts and our firstfruits in Achaia (most of Greece) and how they have consecrated and devoted themselves to the service of the saints (God's people).
1 Corinthians,16,16,I urge you to pay all deference to such leaders and to enlist under them and be subject to them as well as to everyone who joins and cooperates [with you] and labors earnestly.
1 Corinthians,16,17,I am happy because Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus have come [to me] for they have made up for your absence.
1 Corinthians,16,18,For they gave me respite from labor and rested me and refreshed my spirit as well as yours. Deeply appreciate and thoroughly know and fully recognize such men.
1 Corinthians,16,19,The churches of Asia send greetings and best wishes. Aquila and Prisca together with the church [that meets] in their house send you their hearty greetings in the Lord.
1 Corinthians,16,20,All the brethren wish to be remembered to you and wish you well. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
1 Corinthians,16,21,I Paul [add this final] greeting with my own hand.
1 Corinthians,16,22,If anyone does not love the Lord [does not have a friendly affection for Him and is not kindly disposed toward Him] he shall be accursed! Our Lord will come! (Maranatha!)
1 Corinthians,16,23,The grace (favor and spiritual blessing) of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
1 Corinthians,16,24,My love (that true love growing out of sincere devotion to God) be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen (so be it).
2 Corinthians,1,1,PAUL AN apostle (a special messenger) of Christ Jesus by the will of God and Timothy [our] brother to the church (assembly) of God which is at Corinth and to all the saints (the people of God) throughout Achaia (most of Greece):
2 Corinthians,1,2,Grace (favor and spiritual blessing) to you and [heart] peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One).
2 Corinthians,1,3,Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ the Father of sympathy (pity and mercy) and the God [Who is the Source] of every comfort (consolation and encouragement)
2 Corinthians,1,4,Who comforts (consoles and encourages) us in every trouble (calamity and affliction) so that we may also be able to comfort (console and encourage) those who are in any kind of trouble or distress with the comfort (consolation and encouragement) with which we ourselves are comforted (consoled and encouraged) by God.
2 Corinthians,1,5,For just as Christ's [ own] sufferings fall to our lot [as they overflow upon His disciples and we share and experience them] abundantly so through Christ comfort (consolation and encouragement) is also [shared and experienced] abundantly by us.
2 Corinthians,1,6,But if we are troubled (afflicted and distressed) it is for your comfort (consolation and encouragement) and [for your] salvation; and if we are comforted (consoled and encouraged) it is for your comfort (consolation and encouragement) which works [in you] when you patiently endure the same evils (misfortunes and calamities) that we also suffer and undergo.
2 Corinthians,1,7,And our hope for you [our joyful and confident expectation of good for you] is ever unwavering (assured and unshaken); for we know that just as you share and are partners in [our] sufferings and calamities you also share and are partners in [our] comfort (consolation and encouragement).
2 Corinthians,1,8,For we do not want you to be uninformed brethren about the affliction and oppressing distress which befell us in [the province of] Asia how we were so utterly and unbearably weighed down and crushed that we despaired even of life [itself].
2 Corinthians,1,9,Indeed we felt within ourselves that we had received the [very] sentence of death but that was to keep us from trusting in and depending on ourselves instead of on God Who raises the dead.
2 Corinthians,1,10,[For it is He] Who rescued and saved us from such a perilous death and He will still rescue and save us; in and on Him we have set our hope (our joyful and confident expectation) that He will again deliver us [from danger and destruction and draw us to Himself]
2 Corinthians,1,11,While you also cooperate by your prayers for us [helping and laboring together with us]. Thus [the lips of] many persons [turned toward God will eventually] give thanks on our behalf for the grace (the blessing of deliverance) granted us at the request of the many who have prayed.
2 Corinthians,1,12,It is a reason for pride and exultation to which our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world [generally] and especially toward you with devout and pure motives and godly sincerity not in fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God (the unmerited favor and merciful kindness by which God exerting His holy influence upon souls turns them to Christ and keeps strengthens and increases them in Christian virtues).
2 Corinthians,1,13,For we write you nothing else but simply what you can read and understand [there is no double meaning to what we say] and I hope that you will become thoroughly acquainted [with divine things] and know and understand [them] accurately and well to the end
2 Corinthians,1,14,[Just] as you have [already] partially known and understood and acknowledged us and recognized that you can [honestly] be proud of us even as we [can be proud] of you on the day of our Lord Jesus.
2 Corinthians,1,15,It was with assurance of this that I wanted and planned to visit you first [of all] so that you might have a double favor and token of grace (goodwill).
2 Corinthians,1,16,[I wanted] to visit you on my way to Macedonia and [then] to come again to you [on my return trip] from Macedonia and have you send me forward on my way to Judea.
2 Corinthians,1,17,Now because I changed my original plan was I being unstable and capricious? Or what I plan do I plan according to the flesh [like a worldly man] ready to say Yes yes [when it may mean] No no?
2 Corinthians,1,18,As surely as God is trustworthy and faithful and means what He says our speech and message to you have not been Yes [that might mean] No.
2 Corinthians,1,19,For the Son of God Christ Jesus (the Messiah) Who has been preached among you by us by myself Silvanus and Timothy was not Yes and No; but in Him it is [always the divine] Yes.
2 Corinthians,1,20,For as many as are the promises of God they all find their Yes [answer] in Him [Christ]. For this reason we also utter the Amen (so be it) to God through Him [in His Person and by His agency] to the glory of God.
2 Corinthians,1,21,But it is God Who confirms and makes us steadfast and establishes us [in joint fellowship] with you in Christ and has consecrated and anointed us [ enduing us with the gifts of the Holy Spirit];
2 Corinthians,1,22,[He has also appropriated and acknowledged us as His by] putting His seal upon us and giving us His [Holy] Spirit in our hearts as the security deposit and guarantee [of the fulfillment of His promise].
2 Corinthians,1,23,But I call upon God as my soul's witness: it was to avoid hurting you that I refrained from coming to Corinth--
2 Corinthians,1,24,Not that we have dominion [over you] and lord it over your faith but [rather that we work with you as] fellow laborers [to promote] your joy for in [your] faith ( in your strong and welcome conviction or belief that Jesus is the Messiah through Whom we obtain eternal salvation in the kingdom of God) you stand firm.
2 Corinthians,2,1,BUT I definitely made up my mind not to grieve you with another painful and distressing visit.
2 Corinthians,2,2,For if I cause you pain [with merited rebuke] who is there to provide me enjoyment but the [very] one whom I have grieved and made sad?
2 Corinthians,2,3,And I wrote the same to you so that when I came I might not be myself pained by those who are the [very] ones who ought to make me glad for I trusted in you all and felt confident that my joy would be shared by all of you.
2 Corinthians,2,4,For I wrote you out of great sorrow and deep distress [with mental torture and anxiety] of heart [yes and] with many tears not to cause you pain but in order to make you realize the overflowing love that I continue increasingly to have for you.
2 Corinthians,2,5,But if someone [the one among you who committed incest] has caused [all this] grief and pain he has caused it not to me but in some measure not to put it too severely [he has distressed] all of you.
2 Corinthians,2,6,For such a one this censure by the majority [which he has received is] sufficient [punishment].
2 Corinthians,2,7,So [instead of further rebuke now] you should rather turn and [graciously] forgive and comfort and encourage [him] to keep him from being overwhelmed by excessive sorrow and despair.
2 Corinthians,2,8,I therefore beg you to reinstate him in your affections and assure him of your love for him;
2 Corinthians,2,9,For this was my purpose in writing you to test your attitude and see if you would stand the test whether you are obedient and altogether agreeable [to following my orders] in everything.
2 Corinthians,2,10,If you forgive anyone anything I too forgive that one; and what I have forgiven if I have forgiven anything has been for your sakes in the presence [and with the approval] of Christ (the Messiah)
2 Corinthians,2,11,To keep Satan from getting the advantage over us; for we are not ignorant of his wiles and intentions.
2 Corinthians,2,12,Now when I arrived at Troas [to preach] the good news (the Gospel) of Christ a door of opportunity was opened for me in the Lord
2 Corinthians,2,13,Yet my spirit could not rest (relax get relief) because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I took leave from them and departed for Macedonia.
2 Corinthians,2,14,But thanks be to God Who in Christ always leads us in triumph [as trophies of Christ's victory] and through us spreads and makes evident the fragrance of the knowledge of God everywhere
2 Corinthians,2,15,For we are the sweet fragrance of Christ [which exhales] unto God [discernible alike] among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing:
2 Corinthians,2,16,To the latter it is an aroma [wafted] from death to death [a fatal odor the smell of doom]; to the former it is an aroma from life to life [a vital fragrance living and fresh]. And who is qualified (fit and sufficient) for these things? [Who is able for such a ministry? We?]
2 Corinthians,2,17,For we are not like so many [like hucksters making a trade of] peddling God's Word [shortchanging and adulterating the divine message]; but like [men] of sincerity and the purest motive as [commissioned and sent] by God we speak [His message] in Christ (the Messiah) in the [very] sight and presence of God.
2 Corinthians,3,1,ARE WE starting to commend ourselves again? Or we do not like some [false teachers] need written credentials or letters of recommendation to you or from you [do we]?
2 Corinthians,3,2,[No] you yourselves are our letter of recommendation (our credentials) written in your hearts to be known (perceived recognized) and read by everybody.
2 Corinthians,3,3,You show and make obvious that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us not written with ink but with [the] Spirit of [the] living God not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.
2 Corinthians,3,4,Such is the reliance and confidence that we have through Christ toward and with reference to God.
2 Corinthians,3,5,Not that we are fit (qualified and sufficient in ability) of ourselves to form personal judgments or to claim or count anything as coming from us but our power and ability and sufficiency are from God.
2 Corinthians,3,6,[It is He] Who has qualified us [making us to be fit and worthy and sufficient] as ministers and dispensers of a new covenant [of salvation through Christ] not [ministers] of the letter (of legally written code) but of the Spirit; for the code [of the Law] kills but the [Holy] Spirit makes alive.
2 Corinthians,3,7,Now if the dispensation of death engraved in letters on stone [the ministration of the Law] was inaugurated with such glory and splendor that the Israelites were not able to look steadily at the face of Moses because of its brilliance [a glory] that was to fade and pass away
2 Corinthians,3,8,Why should not the dispensation of the Spirit [this spiritual ministry whose task it is to cause men to obtain and be governed by the Holy Spirit] be attended with much greater and more splendid glory?
2 Corinthians,3,9,For if the service that condemns [the ministration of doom] had glory how infinitely more abounding in splendor and glory must be the service that makes righteous [the ministry that produces and fosters righteous living and right standing with God]!
2 Corinthians,3,10,Indeed in view of this fact what once had splendor [ the glory of the Law in the face of Moses] has come to have no splendor at all because of the overwhelming glory that exceeds and excels it [ the glory of the Gospel in the face of Jesus Christ].
2 Corinthians,3,11,For if that which was but passing and fading away came with splendor how much more must that which remains and is permanent abide in glory and splendor!
2 Corinthians,3,12,Since we have such [glorious] hope (such joyful and confident expectation) we speak very freely and openly and fearlessly.
2 Corinthians,3,13,Nor [do we act] like Moses who put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not gaze upon the finish of the vanishing [splendor which had been upon it].
2 Corinthians,3,14,In fact their minds were grown hard and calloused [they had become dull and had lost the power of understanding]; for until this present day when the Old Testament (the old covenant) is being read that same veil still lies [on their hearts] not being lifted [to reveal] that in Christ it is made void and done away.
2 Corinthians,3,15,Yes down to this [very] day whenever Moses is read a veil lies upon their minds and hearts.
2 Corinthians,3,16,But whenever a person turns [in repentance] to the Lord the veil is stripped off and taken away.
2 Corinthians,3,17,Now the Lord is the Spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty (emancipation from bondage freedom).
2 Corinthians,3,18,And all of us as with unveiled face [because we] continued to behold [in the Word of God] as in a mirror the glory of the Lord are constantly being transfigured into His very own image in ever increasing splendor and from one degree of glory to another; [for this comes] from the Lord [Who is] the Spirit.
2 Corinthians,4,1,THEREFORE SINCE we do hold and engage in this ministry by the mercy of God [granting us favor benefits opportunities and especially salvation] we do not get discouraged (spiritless and despondent with fear) or become faint with weariness and exhaustion.
2 Corinthians,4,2,We have renounced disgraceful ways (secret thoughts feelings desires and underhandedness the methods and arts that men hide through shame); we refuse to deal craftily (to practice trickery and cunning) or to adulterate or handle dishonestly the Word of God but we state the truth openly (clearly and candidly). And so we commend ourselves in the sight and presence of God to every man's conscience.
2 Corinthians,4,3,But even if our Gospel (the glad tidings) also be hidden (obscured and covered up with a veil that hinders the knowledge of God) it is hidden [only] to those who are perishing and obscured [only] to those who are spiritually dying and veiled [only] to those who are lost.
2 Corinthians,4,4,For the god of this world has blinded the unbelievers' minds [that they should not discern the truth] preventing them from seeing the illuminating light of the Gospel of the glory of Christ (the Messiah) Who is the Image and Likeness of God.
2 Corinthians,4,5,For what we preach is not ourselves but Jesus Christ as Lord and ourselves [merely] as your servants (slaves) for Jesus' sake.
2 Corinthians,4,6,For God Who said Let light shine out of darkness has shone in our hearts so as [to beam forth] the Light for the illumination of the knowledge of the majesty and glory of God [as it is manifest in the Person and is revealed] in the face of Jesus Christ (the Messiah).
2 Corinthians,4,7,However we possess this precious treasure [the divine Light of the Gospel] in [frail human] vessels of earth that the grandeur and exceeding greatness of the power may be shown to be from God and not from ourselves.
2 Corinthians,4,8,We are hedged in (pressed) on every side [troubled and oppressed in every way] but not cramped or crushed; we suffer embarrassments and are perplexed and unable to find a way out but not driven to despair;
2 Corinthians,4,9,We are pursued (persecuted and hard driven) but not deserted [to stand alone]; we are struck down to the ground but never struck out and destroyed;
2 Corinthians,4,10,Always carrying about in the body the liability and exposure to the same putting to death that the Lord Jesus suffered so that the [ resurrection] life of Jesus also may be shown forth by and in our bodies.
2 Corinthians,4,11,For we who live are constantly [experiencing] being handed over to death for Jesus' sake that the [ resurrection] life of Jesus also may be evidenced through our flesh which is liable to death.
2 Corinthians,4,12,Thus death is actively at work in us but [it is in order that our] life [may be actively at work] in you.
2 Corinthians,4,13,Yet we have the same spirit of faith as he had who wrote I have believed and therefore have I spoken. We too believe and therefore we speak
2 Corinthians,4,14,Assured that He Who raised up the Lord Jesus will raise us up also with Jesus and bring us [along] with you into His presence.
2 Corinthians,4,15,For all [these] things are [taking place] for your sake so that the more grace (divine favor and spiritual blessing) extends to more and more people and multiplies through the many the more thanksgiving may increase [and redound] to the glory of God.
2 Corinthians,4,16,Therefore we do not become discouraged (utterly spiritless exhausted and wearied out through fear). Though our outer man is [progressively] decaying and wasting away yet our inner self is being [progressively] renewed day after day.
2 Corinthians,4,17,For our light momentary affliction (this slight distress of the passing hour) is ever more and more abundantly preparing and producing and achieving for us an everlasting weight of glory [beyond all measure excessively surpassing all comparisons and all calculations a vast and transcendent glory and blessedness never to cease!]
2 Corinthians,4,18,Since we consider and look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen; for the things that are visible are temporal (brief and fleeting) but the things that are invisible are deathless and everlasting.
2 Corinthians,5,1,FOR WE know that if the tent which is our earthly home is destroyed (dissolved) we have from God a building a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens.
2 Corinthians,5,2,Here indeed in this [present abode body] we sigh and groan inwardly because we yearn to be clothed over [we yearn to put on our celestial body like a garment to be fitted out] with our heavenly dwelling
2 Corinthians,5,3,So that by putting it on we may not be found naked (without a body).
2 Corinthians,5,4,For while we are still in this tent we groan under the burden and sigh deeply (weighed down depressed oppressed)--not that we want to put off the body (the clothing of the spirit) but rather that we would be further clothed so that what is mortal (our dying body) may be swallowed up by life [ after the resurrection].
2 Corinthians,5,5,Now He Who has fashioned us [preparing and making us fit] for this very thing is God Who also has given us the [Holy] Spirit as a guarantee [of the fulfillment of His promise].
2 Corinthians,5,6,So then we are always full of good and hopeful and confident courage; we know that while we are at home in the body we are abroad from the home with the Lord [that is promised us].
2 Corinthians,5,7,For we walk by faith [we regulate our lives and conduct ourselves by our conviction or belief respecting man's relationship to God and divine things with trust and holy fervor; thus we walk] not by sight or appearance.
2 Corinthians,5,8,[Yes] we have confident and hopeful courage and are pleased rather to be away from home out of the body and be at home with the Lord.
2 Corinthians,5,9,Therefore whether we are at home [on earth away from Him] or away from home [and with Him] we are constantly ambitious and strive earnestly to be pleasing to Him.
2 Corinthians,5,10,For we must all appear and be revealed as we are before the judgment seat of Christ so that each one may receive [his pay] according to what he has done in the body whether good or evil [considering what his purpose and motive have been and what he has achieved been busy with and given himself and his attention to accomplishing].
2 Corinthians,5,11,Therefore being conscious of fearing the Lord with respect and reverence we seek to win people over [to persuade them]. But what sort of persons we are is plainly recognized and thoroughly understood by God and I hope that it is plainly recognized and thoroughly understood also by your consciences (your inborn discernment).
2 Corinthians,5,12,We are not commending ourselves to you again but we are providing you with an occasion and incentive to be [rightfully] proud of us so that you may have a reply for those who pride themselves on surface appearances [ on the virtues they only appear to have] although their heart is devoid of them.
2 Corinthians,5,13,For if we are beside ourselves [mad as some say] it is for God and concerns Him; if we are in our right mind it is for your benefit
2 Corinthians,5,14,For the love of Christ controls and urges and impels us because we are of the opinion and conviction that [if] One died for all then all died;
2 Corinthians,5,15,And He died for all so that all those who live might live no longer to and for themselves but to and for Him Who died and was raised again for their sake.
2 Corinthians,5,16,Consequently from now on we estimate and regard no one from a [purely] human point of view [in terms of natural standards of value]. [No] even though we once did estimate Christ from a human viewpoint and as a man yet now [we have such knowledge of Him that] we know Him no longer [in terms of the flesh].
2 Corinthians,5,17,Therefore if any person is [ingrafted] in Christ (the Messiah) he is a new creation (a new creature altogether); the old [previous moral and spiritual condition] has passed away. Behold the fresh and new has come!
2 Corinthians,5,18,But all things are from God Who through Jesus Christ reconciled us to Himself [received us into favor brought us into harmony with Himself] and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation [that by word and deed we might aim to bring others into harmony with Him].
2 Corinthians,5,19,It was God [personally present] in Christ reconciling and restoring the world to favor with Himself not counting up and holding against [men] their trespasses [but cancelling them] and committing to us the message of reconciliation (of the restoration to favor).
2 Corinthians,5,20,So we are Christ's ambassadors God making His appeal as it were through us. We [as Christ's personal representatives] beg you for His sake to lay hold of the divine favor [now offered you] and be reconciled to God.
2 Corinthians,5,21,For our sake He made Christ [virtually] to be sin Who knew no sin so that in and through Him we might become [ endued with viewed as being in and examples of] the righteousness of God [what we ought to be approved and acceptable and in right relationship with Him by His goodness].
2 Corinthians,6,1,LABORING TOGETHER [as God's fellow workers] with Him then we beg of you not to receive the grace of God in vain [that merciful kindness by which God exerts His holy influence on souls and turns them to Christ keeping and strengthening them--do not receive it to no purpose].
2 Corinthians,6,2,For He says In the time of favor (of an assured welcome) I have listened to and heeded your call and I have helped you on the day of deliverance (the day of salvation). Behold now is truly the time for a gracious welcome and acceptance [of you from God]; behold now is the day of salvation!
2 Corinthians,6,3,We put no obstruction in anybody's way [we give no offense in anything] so that no fault may be found and [our] ministry blamed and discredited.
2 Corinthians,6,4,But we commend ourselves in every way as [true] servants of God: through great endurance in tribulation and suffering in hardships and privations in sore straits and calamities
2 Corinthians,6,5,In beatings imprisonments riots labors sleepless watching hunger;
2 Corinthians,6,6,By innocence and purity knowledge and spiritual insight longsuffering and patience kindness in the Holy Spirit in unfeigned love;
2 Corinthians,6,7,By [speaking] the word of truth in the power of God with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand [to attack] and for the left hand [to defend];
2 Corinthians,6,8,Amid honor and dishonor; in defaming and evil report and in praise and good report. [We are branded] as deceivers (impostors) and [yet vindicated as] truthful and honest.
2 Corinthians,6,9,[We are treated] as unknown and ignored [by the world] and [yet we are] well-known and recognized [by God and His people]; as dying and yet here we are alive; as chastened by suffering and [yet] not killed;
2 Corinthians,6,10,As grieved and mourning yet [we are] always rejoicing; as poor [ourselves yet] bestowing riches on many; as having nothing and [yet in reality] possessing all things.
2 Corinthians,6,11,Our mouth is open to you Corinthians [we are hiding nothing keeping nothing back] and our heart is expanded wide [for you]!
2 Corinthians,6,12,There is no lack of room for you in [our hearts] but you lack room in your own affections [for us].
2 Corinthians,6,13,By way of return then do this for me--I speak as to children--open wide your hearts also [to us].
2 Corinthians,6,14,Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers [do not make mismated alliances with them or come under a different yoke with them inconsistent with your faith]. For what partnership have right living and right standing with God with iniquity and lawlessness? Or how can light have fellowship with darkness?
2 Corinthians,6,15,What harmony can there be between Christ and Belial [the devil]? Or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever?
2 Corinthians,6,16,What agreement [can there be between] a temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God; even as God said I will dwell in and with and among them and will walk in and with and among them and I will be their God and they shall be My people.
2 Corinthians,6,17,So come out from among [unbelievers] and separate (sever) yourselves from them says the Lord and touch not [any] unclean thing; then I will receive you kindly and treat you with favor
2 Corinthians,6,18,And I will be a Father to you and you shall be My sons and daughters says the Lord Almighty.
2 Corinthians,7,1,THEREFORE SINCE these [great] promises are ours beloved let us cleanse ourselves from everything that contaminates and defiles body and spirit and bring [our] consecration to completeness in the [reverential] fear of God.
2 Corinthians,7,2,Do open your hearts to us again [enlarge them to take us in]. We have wronged no one we have betrayed or corrupted no one we have cheated or taken advantage of no one.
2 Corinthians,7,3,I do not say this to reproach or condemn [you] for I have said before that you are [nested] in our hearts [and you will remain there] together [with us] whether we die or live.
2 Corinthians,7,4,I have great boldness and free and fearless confidence and cheerful courage toward you; my pride in you is great. I am filled [brimful] with the comfort [of it]; with all our tribulation and in spite of it [I am filled with comfort] I am overflowing with joy.
2 Corinthians,7,5,For even when we arrived in Macedonia our bodies had no ease or rest but we were oppressed in every way and afflicted at every turn--fighting and contentions without dread and fears within [us].
2 Corinthians,7,6,But God Who comforts and encourages and refreshes and cheers the depressed and the sinking comforted and encouraged and refreshed and cheered us by the arrival of Titus.
2 Corinthians,7,7,[Yes] and not only by his coming but also by [his account of] the comfort with which he was encouraged and refreshed and cheered as to you while he told us of your yearning affection of how sorry you were [for me] and how eagerly you took my part so that I rejoiced still more.
2 Corinthians,7,8,For even though I did grieve you with my letter I do not regret [it now] though I did regret it; for I see that that letter did pain you though only for a little while;
2 Corinthians,7,9,Yet I am glad now not because you were pained but because you were pained into repentance [and so turned back to God]; for you felt a grief such as God meant you to feel so that in nothing you might suffer loss through us or harm for what we did.
2 Corinthians,7,10,For godly grief and the pain God is permitted to direct produce a repentance that leads and contributes to salvation and deliverance from evil and it never brings regret; but worldly grief (the hopeless sorrow that is characteristic of the pagan world) is deadly [breeding and ending in death].
2 Corinthians,7,11,For [you can look back now and] observe what this same godly sorrow has done for you and has produced in you: what eagerness and earnest care to explain and clear yourselves [of all complicity in the condoning of incest] what indignation [at the sin] what alarm what yearning what zeal [to do justice to all concerned] what readiness to mete out punishment [ to the offender]! At every point you have proved yourselves cleared and guiltless in the matter. [I Cor. 5.]
2 Corinthians,7,12,So although I did write to you [as I did] it was not for the sake and because of the one who did [the] wrong nor on account of the one who suffered [the] wrong but in order that you might realize before God [that your readiness to accept our authority revealed] how zealously you do care for us.
2 Corinthians,7,13,Therefore we are relieved and comforted and encouraged [at the result]. And in addition to our own [personal] consolation we were especially delighted at the joy of Titus because you have all set his mind at rest soothing and refreshing his spirit.
2 Corinthians,7,14,For if I had boasted to him at all concerning you I was not disappointed or put to shame but just as everything we ever said to you was true so our boasting [about you] to Titus has proved true also.
2 Corinthians,7,15,And his heart goes out to you more abundantly than ever as he recalls the submission [to his guidance] that all of you had and the reverence and anxiety [to meet all requirements] with which you accepted and welcomed him.
2 Corinthians,7,16,I am very happy because I now am of good courage and have perfect confidence in you in all things.
2 Corinthians,8,1,WE WANT to tell you further brethren about the grace (the favor and spiritual blessing) of God which has been evident in the churches of Macedonia [arousing in them the desire to give alms];
2 Corinthians,8,2,For in the midst of an ordeal of severe tribulation their abundance of joy and their depth of poverty [together] have overflowed in wealth of lavish generosity on their part.
2 Corinthians,8,3,For as I can bear witness [they gave] according to their ability yes and beyond their ability; and [they did it] voluntarily
2 Corinthians,8,4,Begging us most insistently for the favor and the fellowship of contributing in this ministration for [the relief and support of] the saints [in Jerusalem].
2 Corinthians,8,5,Nor [was this gift of theirs merely the contribution] that we expected but first they gave themselves to the Lord and to us [as His agents] by the will of God [ entirely disregarding their personal interests they gave as much as they possibly could having put themselves at our disposal to be directed by the will of God]--
2 Corinthians,8,6,So much so that we have urged Titus that as he began it he should also complete this beneficent and gracious contribution among you [the church at Corinth].
2 Corinthians,8,7,Now as you abound and excel and are at the front in everything--in faith in expressing yourselves in knowledge in all zeal and in your love for us--[see to it that you come to the front now and] abound and excel in this gracious work [of almsgiving] also.
2 Corinthians,8,8,I give this not as an order [to dictate to you] but to prove by [pointing out] the zeal of others the sincerity of your [own] love also.
2 Corinthians,8,9,For you are becoming progressively acquainted with and recognizing more strongly and clearly the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ (His kindness His gracious generosity His undeserved favor and spiritual blessing) [in] that though He was [so very] rich yet for your sakes He became [so very] poor in order that by His poverty you might become enriched (abundantly supplied).
2 Corinthians,8,10,[It is then] my counsel and my opinion in this matter that I give [you when I say]: It is profitable and fitting for you [now to complete the enterprise] which more than a year ago you not only began but were the first to wish to do anything [about contributions for the relief of the saints at Jerusalem].
2 Corinthians,8,11,So now finish doing it that your [enthusiastic] readiness in desiring it may be equalled by your completion of it according to your ability and means.
2 Corinthians,8,12,For if the [eager] readiness to give is there then it is acceptable and welcomed in proportion to what a person has not according to what he does not have.
2 Corinthians,8,13,For it is not [intended] that other people be eased and relieved [of their responsibility] and you be burdened and suffer [unfairly]
2 Corinthians,8,14,But to have equality [share and share alike] your surplus over necessity at the present time going to meet their want and to equalize the difference created by it so that [at some other time] their surplus in turn may be given to supply your want. Thus there may be equality
2 Corinthians,8,15,As it is written He who gathered much had nothing over and he who gathered little did not lack.
2 Corinthians,8,16,But thanks be to God Who planted the same earnest zeal and care for you in the heart of Titus.
2 Corinthians,8,17,For he not only welcomed and responded to our appeal but was himself so keen in his enthusiasm and interest in you that he is going to you of his own accord.
2 Corinthians,8,18,But we are sending along with him that brother [Luke?] whose praise in the Gospel ministry [is spread] throughout all the churches;
2 Corinthians,8,19,And more than that he has been appointed by the churches to travel as our companion in regard to this bountiful contribution which we are administering for the glory of the Lord Himself and [to show] our eager readiness [as Christians to help one another].
2 Corinthians,8,20,[For] we are on our guard intending that no one should find anything for which to blame us in regard to our administration of this large contribution.
2 Corinthians,8,21,For we take thought beforehand and aim to be honest and absolutely above suspicion not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of men.
2 Corinthians,8,22,Moreover along with them we are sending our brother whom we have often put to the test and have found him zealous (devoted and earnest) in many matters but who is now more [eagerly] earnest than ever because of [his] absolute confidence in you.
2 Corinthians,8,23,As for Titus he is my colleague and shares my work in your service; and as for the [other two] brethren they are the [special] messengers of the churches a credit and glory to Christ (the Messiah).
2 Corinthians,8,24,Show to these men therefore in the sight of the churches the reality and plain truth of your love (your affection goodwill and benevolence) and what [good reasons] I had for boasting about and being proud of you.
2 Corinthians,9,1,NOW ABOUT the offering that is [to be made] for the saints (God's people in Jerusalem) it is quite superfluous that I should write you;
2 Corinthians,9,2,For I am well acquainted with your willingness (your readiness and your eagerness to promote it) and I have proudly told about you to the people of Macedonia saying that Achaia (most of Greece) has been prepared since last year for this contribution; and [consequently] your enthusiasm has stimulated the majority of them.
2 Corinthians,9,3,Still I am sending the brethren [on to you] lest our pride in you should be made an empty boast in this particular case and so that you may be all ready as I told them you would be;
2 Corinthians,9,4,Lest if [any] Macedonians should come with me and find you unprepared [for this generosity] we to say nothing of yourselves be humiliated for our being so confident.
2 Corinthians,9,5,That is why I thought it necessary to urge these brethren to go to you before I do and make arrangements in advance for this bountiful promised gift of yours so that it may be ready not as an extortion [wrung out of you] but as a generous and willing gift.
2 Corinthians,9,6,[Remember] this: he who sows sparingly and grudgingly will also reap sparingly and grudgingly and he who sows generously [ that blessings may come to someone] will also reap generously and with blessings.
2 Corinthians,9,7,"Let each one [give] as he has made up his own mind and purposed in his heart not reluctantly or sorrowfully or under compulsion for God loves (He takes pleasure in prizes above other things and is unwilling to abandon or to do without) a cheerful (joyous \""prompt to do it\"") giver [whose heart is in his giving]."
2 Corinthians,9,8,And God is able to make all grace (every favor and earthly blessing) come to you in abundance so that you may always and under all circumstances and whatever the need be self-sufficient [possessing enough to require no aid or support and furnished in abundance for every good work and charitable donation].
2 Corinthians,9,9,As it is written He [the benevolent person] scatters abroad; He gives to the poor; His deeds of justice and goodness and kindness and benevolence will go on and endure forever!
2 Corinthians,9,10,And [God] Who provides seed for the sower and bread for eating will also provide and multiply your [resources for] sowing and increase the fruits of your righteousness [ which manifests itself in active goodness kindness and charity].
2 Corinthians,9,11,Thus you will be enriched in all things and in every way so that you can be generous and [your generosity as it is] administered by us will bring forth thanksgiving to God.
2 Corinthians,9,12,For the service that the ministering of this fund renders does not only fully supply what is lacking to the saints (God's people) but it also overflows in many [cries of] thanksgiving to God.
2 Corinthians,9,13,Because at [your] standing of the test of this ministry they will glorify God for your loyalty and obedience to the Gospel of Christ which you confess as well as for your generous-hearted liberality to them and to all [the other needy ones].
2 Corinthians,9,14,And they yearn for you while they pray for you because of the surpassing measure of God's grace (His favor and mercy and spiritual blessing which is shown forth) in you.
2 Corinthians,9,15,Now thanks be to God for His Gift [precious] beyond telling [His indescribable inexpressible free Gift]!
2 Corinthians,10,1,NOW I myself Paul beseech you by the gentleness and consideration of Christ [Himself; I] who [am] lowly enough [so they say] when among you face to face but bold (fearless and outspoken) to you when [I am] absent from you!
2 Corinthians,10,2,I entreat you when I do come [to you] that I may not [be driven to such] boldness as I intend to show toward those few who suspect us of acting according to the flesh [on the low level of worldly motives and as if invested with only human powers].
2 Corinthians,10,3,For though we walk (live) in the flesh we are not carrying on our warfare according to the flesh and using mere human weapons.
2 Corinthians,10,4,For the weapons of our warfare are not physical [weapons of flesh and blood] but they are mighty before God for the overthrow and destruction of strongholds
2 Corinthians,10,5,[Inasmuch as we] refute arguments and theories and reasonings and every proud and lofty thing that sets itself up against the [true] knowledge of God; and we lead every thought and purpose away captive into the obedience of Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One)
2 Corinthians,10,6,Being in readiness to punish every [insubordinate for his] disobedience when your own submission and obedience [as a church] are fully secured and complete.
2 Corinthians,10,7,Look at [this obvious fact] which is before your eyes. If anyone is confident that he is Christ's let him reflect and remind himself that even as he is Christ's so too are we.
2 Corinthians,10,8,For even though I boast rather freely about our power and authority which the Lord gave for your upbuilding and not for demolishing you yet I shall not be put to shame [for exceeding the truth]
2 Corinthians,10,9,Neither would I seem to be overawing or frightening you with my letters;
2 Corinthians,10,10,For they say His letters are weighty and impressive and forceful and telling but his personality and bodily presence are weak and his speech and delivery are utterly contemptible (of no account).
2 Corinthians,10,11,Let such people realize that what we say by letters when we are absent [we put] also into deeds when we are present--
2 Corinthians,10,12,Not that we [have the audacity to] venture to class or [even to] compare ourselves with some who exalt and furnish testimonials for themselves! However when they measure themselves with themselves and compare themselves with one another they are without understanding and behave unwisely.
2 Corinthians,10,13,We on the other hand will not boast beyond our legitimate province and proper limit but will keep within the limits [of our commission which] God has allotted us as our measuring line and which reaches and includes even you.
2 Corinthians,10,14,For we are not overstepping the limits of our province and stretching beyond our ability to reach as though we reached not (had no legitimate mission) to you for we were [the very first] to come even as far as to you with the good news (the Gospel) of Christ.
2 Corinthians,10,15,We do not boast therefore beyond our proper limit over other men's labors but we have the hope and confident expectation that as your faith continues to grow our field among you may be greatly enlarged still within the limits of our commission
2 Corinthians,10,16,So that [we may even] preach the Gospel in lands [lying] beyond you without making a boast of work already done in another [man's] sphere of activity [before we came on the scene].
2 Corinthians,10,17,However let him who boasts and glories boast and glory in the Lord.
2 Corinthians,10,18,For [it is] not [the man] who praises and commends himself who is approved and accepted but [it is the person] whom the Lord accredits and commends.
2 Corinthians,11,1,I WISH you would bear with me while I indulge in a little [so-called] foolishness. Do bear with me!
2 Corinthians,11,2,For I am zealous for you with a godly eagerness and a divine jealousy for I have betrothed you to one Husband to present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.
2 Corinthians,11,3,But [now] I am fearful lest that even as the serpent beguiled Eve by his cunning so your minds may be corrupted and seduced from wholehearted and sincere and pure devotion to Christ.
2 Corinthians,11,4,For [you seem readily to endure it] if a man comes and preaches another Jesus than the One we preached or if you receive a different spirit from the [Spirit] you [once] received or a different gospel from the one you [then] received and welcomed; you tolerate [all that] well enough!
2 Corinthians,11,5,Yet I consider myself as in no way inferior to these [precious] extra-super [false] apostles.
2 Corinthians,11,6,But even if [I am] unskilled in speaking yet [I am] not [unskilled] in knowledge [I know what I am talking about]; we have made this evident to you in all things.
2 Corinthians,11,7,But did I perhaps make a mistake and do you a wrong in debasing and cheapening myself so that you might be exalted and enriched in dignity and honor and happiness by preaching God's Gospel without expense to you?
2 Corinthians,11,8,Other churches I have robbed by accepting [more than their share of] support for my ministry [from them in order] to serve you.
2 Corinthians,11,9,And when I was with you and ran short financially I did not burden any [of you] for what I lacked was abundantly made up by the brethren who came from Macedonia. So I kept myself from being burdensome to you in any way and will continue to keep [myself from being so].
2 Corinthians,11,10,As the truth of Christ is in me this my boast [of independence] shall not be debarred (silenced or checked) in the regions of Achaia (most of Greece).
2 Corinthians,11,11,And why? Because I do not love you [do not have a preference for you wish you well and regard your welfare]? God perceives and knows that I do!
2 Corinthians,11,12,But what I do I will continue to do [for I am determined to maintain this independence] in order to cut off the claim of those who would like [to find an occasion and incentive] to claim that in their boasted [mission] they work on the same terms that we do.
2 Corinthians,11,13,For such men are false apostles [spurious counterfeits] deceitful workmen masquerading as apostles (special messengers) of Christ (the Messiah).
2 Corinthians,11,14,And it is no wonder for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light;
2 Corinthians,11,15,So it is not surprising if his servants also masquerade as ministers of righteousness. [But] their end will correspond with their deeds.
2 Corinthians,11,16,I repeat then let no one think I have lost my wits; but even if you do then bear with a witless man so that I too may boast a little.
2 Corinthians,11,17,What I say by way of this confident boasting I say not with the Lord's authority [by inspiration] but as it were in pure witlessness.
2 Corinthians,11,18,[For] since many boast of worldly things and according to the flesh I will glory (boast) also.
2 Corinthians,11,19,For you readily and gladly bear with the foolish since you are so smart and wise yourselves!
2 Corinthians,11,20,For you endure it if a man assumes control of your souls and makes slaves of you or devours [your substance spends your money] and preys upon you or deceives and takes advantage of you or is arrogant and puts on airs or strikes you in the face.
2 Corinthians,11,21,To my discredit I must say we have shown ourselves too weak [for you to show such tolerance of us and for us to do strong courageous things like that to you]! But in whatever any person is bold and dares [to boast]--mind you I am speaking in this foolish (witless) way--I also am bold and dare [to boast].
2 Corinthians,11,22,They are Hebrews? So am I! They are Israelites? So am I! They are descendants of Abraham? So am I!
2 Corinthians,11,23,Are they [ministering] servants of Christ (the Messiah)? I am talking like one beside himself [but] I am more with far more extensive and abundant labors with far more imprisonments [beaten] with countless stripes and frequently [at the point of] death.
2 Corinthians,11,24,Five times I received from [the hands of] the Jews forty [lashes all] but one;
2 Corinthians,11,25,Three times I have been beaten with rods; once I was stoned. Three times I have been aboard a ship wrecked at sea; a [whole] night and a day I have spent [adrift] on the deep;
2 Corinthians,11,26,Many times on journeys [exposed to] perils from rivers perils from bandits perils from [my own] nation perils from the Gentiles perils in the city perils in the desert places perils in the sea perils from those posing as believers [but destitute of Christian knowledge and piety];
2 Corinthians,11,27,In toil and hardship watching often [through sleepless nights] in hunger and thirst frequently driven to fasting by want in cold and exposure and lack of clothing.
2 Corinthians,11,28,And besides those things that are without there is the daily [inescapable pressure] of my care and anxiety for all the churches!
2 Corinthians,11,29,Who is weak and I do not feel [his] weakness? Who is made to stumble and fall and have his faith hurt and I am not on fire [with sorrow or indignation]?
2 Corinthians,11,30,If I must boast I will boast of the things that [show] my infirmity [of the things by which I am made weak and contemptible in the eyes of my opponents].
2 Corinthians,11,31,The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ knows He Who is blessed and to be praised forevermore that I do not lie.
2 Corinthians,11,32,In Damascus the city governor acting under King Aretas guarded the city of Damascus [on purpose] to arrest me
2 Corinthians,11,33,And I was [actually] let down in a [rope] basket or hamper through a window (a small door) in the wall and I escaped through his fingers.
2 Corinthians,12,1,TRUE THERE is nothing to be gained by it but [as I am obliged] to boast I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord.
2 Corinthians,12,2,I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago--whether in the body or out of the body I do not know God knows--was caught up to the third heaven.
2 Corinthians,12,3,And I know that this man--whether in the body or away from the body I do not know God knows--
2 Corinthians,12,4,Was caught up into paradise and he heard utterances beyond the power of man to put into words which man is not permitted to utter.
2 Corinthians,12,5,Of this same [man's experiences] I will boast but of myself (personally) I will not boast except as regards my infirmities (my weaknesses).
2 Corinthians,12,6,Should I desire to boast I shall not be a witless braggart for I shall be speaking the truth. But I abstain [from it] so that no one may form a higher estimate of me than [is justified by] what he sees in me or hears from me.
2 Corinthians,12,7,And to keep me from being puffed up and too much elated by the exceeding greatness (preeminence) of these revelations there was given me a thorn ( a splinter) in the flesh a messenger of Satan to rack and buffet and harass me to keep me from being excessively exalted. [Job. 2:6.]
2 Corinthians,12,8,Three times I called upon the Lord and besought [Him] about this and begged that it might depart from me;
2 Corinthians,12,9,But He said to me My grace (My favor and loving-kindness and mercy) is enough for you [sufficient against any danger and enables you to bear the trouble manfully]; for My strength and power are made perfect (fulfilled and completed) and show themselves most effective in [your] weakness. Therefore I will all the more gladly glory in my weaknesses and infirmities that the strength and power of Christ (the Messiah) may rest (yes may pitch a tent over and dwell) upon me!
2 Corinthians,12,10,So for the sake of Christ I am well pleased and take pleasure in infirmities insults hardships persecutions perplexities and distresses; for when I am weak [ in human strength] then am I [truly] strong (able powerful in divine strength).
2 Corinthians,12,11,Now I have been [speaking like] a fool! But you forced me to it for I ought to have been [ saved the necessity and] commended by you. For I have not fallen short one bit or proved myself at all inferior to those superlative [false] apostles [of yours] even if I am nothing (a nobody).
2 Corinthians,12,12,Indeed the signs that indicate a [genuine] apostle were performed among you fully and most patiently in miracles and wonders and mighty works.
2 Corinthians,12,13,For in what respect were you put to a disadvantage in comparison with the rest of the churches unless [it was for the fact] that I myself did not burden you [with my financial support]? Pardon me [for doing you] this injustice!
2 Corinthians,12,14,Now for the third time I am ready to come to [visit] you. And I will not burden you [financially] for it is not your [money] that I want but you; for children are not duty bound to lay up store for their parents but parents for their children.
2 Corinthians,12,15,But I will most gladly spend [myself] and be utterly spent for your souls. If I love you exceedingly am I to be loved [by you] the less?
2 Corinthians,12,16,But though granting that I did not burden you [with my support some say that] I was crafty [and that] I cheated and got the better of you with my trickery.
2 Corinthians,12,17,Did I [then] take advantage of you or make any money out of you through any of those [messengers] whom I sent to you?
2 Corinthians,12,18,[Actually] I urged Titus [to go] and I sent the brother with [him]. Did Titus overreach or take advantage of you [in anything]? Did he and I not act in the same spirit? Did we not [take the] same steps?
2 Corinthians,12,19,Have you been supposing [all this time] that we have been defending ourselves and apologizing to you? [It is] in the sight and the [very] presence of God [and as one] in Christ (the Messiah) that we have been speaking dearly beloved and all in order to build you up [spiritually].
2 Corinthians,12,20,For I am fearful that somehow or other I may come and find you not as I desire to find you and that you may find me too not as you want to find me--that perhaps there may be factions (quarreling) jealousy temper (wrath intrigues rivalry divided loyalties) selfishness whispering gossip arrogance (self-assertion) and disorder among you.
2 Corinthians,12,21,[I am fearful] that when I come again my God may humiliate and humble me in your regard and that I may have to sorrow over many of those who sinned before and have not repented of the impurity sexual vice and sensuality which they formerly practiced.
2 Corinthians,13,1,THIS IS the third time that I am coming to you. By the testimony of two or three witnesses must any charge and every accusing statement be sustained and confirmed.
2 Corinthians,13,2,I have already warned those who sinned formerly and all the rest also and I warn them now again while I am absent as I did when present on my second visit that if I come back I will not spare [them]
2 Corinthians,13,3,Since you desire and seek [perceptible] proof of the Christ Who speaks in and through me. [For He] is not weak and feeble in dealing with you but is a mighty power within you;
2 Corinthians,13,4,For though He was crucified in weakness yet He goes on living by the power of God. And though we too are weak in Him [as He was humanly weak] yet in dealing with you [we shall show ourselves] alive and strong in [fellowship with] Him by the power of God.
2 Corinthians,13,5,Examine and test and evaluate your own selves to see whether you are holding to your faith and showing the proper fruits of it. Test and prove yourselves [ not Christ]. Do you not yourselves realize and know [thoroughly by an ever-increasing experience] that Jesus Christ is in you--unless you are [counterfeits] disapproved on trial and rejected?
2 Corinthians,13,6,But I hope you will recognize and know that we are not disapproved on trial and rejected.
2 Corinthians,13,7,But I pray to God that you may do nothing wrong not in order that we [ our teaching] may appear to be approved but that you may continue doing right [though] we may seem to have failed and be unapproved.
2 Corinthians,13,8,For we can do nothing against the Truth [ not serve any party or personal interest] but only for the Truth [ which is the Gospel].
2 Corinthians,13,9,For we are glad when we are weak ( unapproved) and you are really strong. And this we also pray for: your all-round strengthening and perfecting of soul.
2 Corinthians,13,10,So I write these things while I am absent from you that when I come to you I may not have to deal sharply in my use of the authority which the Lord has given me [to be employed however] for building [you] up and not for tearing [you] down.
2 Corinthians,13,11,Finally brethren farewell (rejoice)! Be strengthened (perfected completed made what you ought to be); be encouraged and consoled and comforted; be of the same [agreeable] mind one with another; live in peace and [then] the God of love [Who is the Source of affection goodwill love and benevolence toward men] and the Author and Promoter of peace will be with you.
2 Corinthians,13,12,Greet one another with a consecrated kiss.
2 Corinthians,13,13,All the saints (the people of God here) salute you.
2 Corinthians,13,14,The grace (favor and spiritual blessing) of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the presence and fellowship (the communion and sharing together and participation) in the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen (so be it).
Galatians,1,1,PAUL AN apostle--[special messenger appointed and commissioned and sent out] not from [any body of] men nor by or through any man but by and through Jesus Christ (the Messiah) and God the Father Who raised Him from among the dead--
Galatians,1,2,And all the brethren who are with me to the churches of Galatia:
Galatians,1,3,Grace and spiritual blessing be to you and [soul] peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah)
Galatians,1,4,Who gave (yielded) Himself up [ to atone] for our sins [and to save and sanctify us] in order to rescue and deliver us from this present wicked age and world order in accordance with the will and purpose and plan of our God and Father--
Galatians,1,5,To Him [be ascribed all] the glory through all the ages of the ages and the eternities of the eternities! Amen (so be it).
Galatians,1,6,I am surprised and astonished that you are so quickly turning renegade and deserting Him Who invited and called you by the grace (unmerited favor) of Christ (the Messiah) [and that you are transferring your allegiance] to a different [even an opposition] gospel.
Galatians,1,7,Not that there is [or could be] any other [genuine Gospel] but there are [obviously] some who are troubling and disturbing and bewildering you [ with a different kind of teaching which they offer as a gospel] and want to pervert and distort the Gospel of Christ (the Messiah) [into something which it absolutely is not].
Galatians,1,8,But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to and different from that which we preached to you let him be accursed (anathema devoted to destruction doomed to eternal punishment)!
Galatians,1,9,As we said before so I now say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel different from or contrary to that which you received [from us] let him be accursed (anathema devoted to destruction doomed to eternal punishment)!
Galatians,1,10,Now am I trying to win the favor of men or of God? Do I seek to please men? If I were still seeking popularity with men I should not be a bond servant of Christ (the Messiah).
Galatians,1,11,For I want you to know brethren that the Gospel which was proclaimed and made known by me is not man's gospel [a human invention according to or patterned after any human standard].
Galatians,1,12,For indeed I did not receive it from man nor was I taught it but [it came to me] through a [direct] revelation [given] by Jesus Christ (the Messiah).
Galatians,1,13,You have heard of my earlier career and former manner of life in the Jewish religion (Judaism) how I persecuted and abused the church of God furiously and extensively and [with fanatical zeal did my best] to make havoc of it and destroy it.
Galatians,1,14,And [you have heard how] I outstripped many of the men of my own generation among the people of my race in [my advancement in study and observance of the laws of] Judaism so extremely enthusiastic and zealous I was for the traditions of my ancestors.
Galatians,1,15,But when He Who had chosen and set me apart [even] before I was born and had called me by His grace (His undeserved favor and blessing) saw fit and was pleased
Galatians,1,16,To reveal (unveil disclose) His Son within me so that I might proclaim Him among the Gentiles (the non-Jewish world) as the glad tidings (Gospel) immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood [did not consult or counsel with any frail human being or communicate with anyone].
Galatians,1,17,Nor did I [even] go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles (special messengers of Christ) before I was but I went away and retired into Arabia and afterward I came back again to Damascus.
Galatians,1,18,Then three years later I did go up to Jerusalem to become [personally] acquainted with Cephas (Peter) and remained with him for fifteen days.
Galatians,1,19,But I did not see any of the other apostles (the special messengers of Christ) except James the brother of our Lord.
Galatians,1,20,Now [note carefully what I am telling you for it is the truth] I write this as if I were standing before the bar of God; I do not lie.
Galatians,1,21,Then I went into the districts (countries regions) of Syria and Cilicia.
Galatians,1,22,And so far I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Christ in Judea (the country surrounding Jerusalem).
Galatians,1,23,They were only hearing it said He who used to persecute us is now proclaiming the very faith he once reviled and which he set out to ruin and tried with all his might to destroy.
Galatians,1,24,And they glorified God [as the Author and Source of what had taken place] in me.
Galatians,2,1,THEN AFTER [an interval] of fourteen years I again went up to Jerusalem. [This time I went] with Barnabas taking Titus along with [me] also.
Galatians,2,2,I went because it was specially and divinely revealed to me that I should go and I put before them the Gospel [declaring to them that] which I preach among the Gentiles. However [I presented the matter] privately before those of repute [for I wanted to make certain by thus at first confining my communication to this private conference] that I was not running or had not run in vain [guarding against being discredited either in what I was planning to do or had already done].
Galatians,2,3,But [all went well!] even Titus who was with me was not compelled [as some had anticipated] to be circumcised although he was a Greek.
Galatians,2,4,[My precaution was] because of false brethren who had been secretly smuggled in [to the Christian brotherhood]; they had slipped in to spy on our liberty and the freedom which we have in Christ Jesus that they might again bring us into bondage [under the Law of Moses].
Galatians,2,5,To them we did not yield submission even for a moment that the truth of the Gospel might continue to be [preserved] for you [in its purity].
Galatians,2,6,Moreover [no new requirements were made] by those who were reputed to be something--though what was their individual position and whether they really were of importance or not makes no difference to me; God is not impressed with the positions that men hold and He is not partial and recognizes no external distinctions--those [I say] who were of repute imposed no new requirements upon me [had nothing to add to my Gospel and from them I received no new suggestions].
Galatians,2,7,But on the contrary when they [really] saw that I had been entrusted [to carry] the Gospel to the uncircumcised [Gentiles just as definitely] as Peter had been entrusted [to proclaim] the Gospel to the circumcised [Jews they were agreeable];
Galatians,2,8,For He Who motivated and fitted Peter and worked effectively through him for the mission to the circumcised motivated and fitted me and worked through me also for [the mission to] the Gentiles.
Galatians,2,9,And when they knew (perceived recognized understood and acknowledged) the grace (God's unmerited favor and spiritual blessing) that had been bestowed upon me James and Cephas (Peter) and John who were reputed to be pillars of the Jerusalem church gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship with the understanding that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised (Jews).
Galatians,2,10,They only [made one stipulation] that we were to remember the poor which very thing I was also eager to do.
Galatians,2,11,But when Cephas (Peter) came to Antioch I protested and opposed him to his face [concerning his conduct there] for he was blameable and stood condemned.
Galatians,2,12,For up to the time that certain persons came from James he ate his meals with the Gentile [converts]; but when the men [from Jerusalem] arrived he withdrew and held himself aloof from the Gentiles and [ate] separately for fear of those of the circumcision [party].
Galatians,2,13,And the rest of the Jews along with him also concealed their true convictions and acted insincerely with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy (their example of insincerity and pretense).
Galatians,2,14,But as soon as I saw that they were not straightforward and were not living up to the truth of the Gospel I said to Cephas (Peter) before everybody present If you though born a Jew can live [as you have been living] like a Gentile and not like a Jew how do you dare now to urge and practically force the Gentiles to [comply with the ritual of Judaism and] live like Jews?
Galatians,2,15,[I went on to say] Although we ourselves (you and I) are Jews by birth and not Gentile (heathen) sinners
Galatians,2,16,Yet we know that a man is justified or reckoned righteous and in right standing with God not by works of the Law but [only] through faith and [absolute] reliance on and adherence to and trust in Jesus Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One). [Therefore] even we [ourselves] have believed on Christ Jesus in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the Law [for we cannot be justified by any observance of the ritual of the Law given by Moses] because by keeping legal rituals and by works no human being can ever be justified (declared righteous and put in right standing with God).
Galatians,2,17,But if in our desire and endeavor to be justified in Christ [to be declared righteous and put in right standing with God wholly and solely through Christ] we have shown ourselves sinners also and convicted of sin does that make Christ a minister (a party and contributor) to our sin? Banish the thought! [Of course not!]
Galatians,2,18,For if I [or any others who have taught that the observance of the Law of Moses is not essential to being justified by God should now by word or practice teach or intimate that it is essential to] build up again what I tore down I prove myself a transgressor.
Galatians,2,19,For I through the Law [under the operation of the curse of the Law] have [in Christ's death for me] myself died to the Law and all the Law's demands upon me so that I may [henceforth] live to and for God.
Galatians,2,20,I have been crucified with Christ [in Him I have shared His crucifixion]; it is no longer I who live but Christ (the Messiah) lives in me; and the life I now live in the body I live by faith in (by adherence to and reliance on and complete trust in) the Son of God Who loved me and gave Himself up for me.
Galatians,2,21,[Therefore I do not treat God's gracious gift as something of minor importance and defeat its very purpose]; I do not set aside and invalidate and frustrate and nullify the grace (unmerited favor) of God. For if justification (righteousness acquittal from guilt) comes through [observing the ritual of] the Law then Christ (the Messiah) died groundlessly and to no purpose and in vain. [His death was then wholly superfluous.]
Galatians,3,1,O YOU poor and silly and thoughtless and unreflecting and senseless Galatians! Who has fascinated or bewitched or cast a spell over you unto whom--right before your very eyes--Jesus Christ (the Messiah) was openly and graphically set forth and portrayed as crucified?
Galatians,3,2,Let me ask you this one question: Did you receive the [Holy] Spirit as the result of obeying the Law and doing its works or was it by hearing [the message of the Gospel] and believing [it]? [Was it from observing a law of rituals or from a message of faith?]
Galatians,3,3,Are you so foolish and so senseless and so silly? Having begun [your new life spiritually] with the [Holy] Spirit are you now reaching perfection [by dependence] on the flesh?
Galatians,3,4,Have you suffered so many things and experienced so much all for nothing (to no purpose)--if it really is to no purpose and in vain?
Galatians,3,5,Then does He Who supplies you with His marvelous [Holy] Spirit and works powerfully and miraculously among you do so on [the grounds of your doing] what the Law demands or because of your believing in and adhering to and trusting in and relying on the message that you heard?
Galatians,3,6,Thus Abraham believed in and adhered to and trusted in and relied on God and it was reckoned and placed to his account and credited as righteousness (as conformity to the divine will in purpose thought and action).
Galatians,3,7,Know and understand that it is [really] the people [who live] by faith who are [the true] sons of Abraham.
Galatians,3,8,And the Scripture foreseeing that God would justify (declare righteous put in right standing with Himself) the Gentiles in consequence of faith proclaimed the Gospel [foretelling the glad tidings of a Savior long beforehand] to Abraham in the promise saying In you shall all the nations [of the earth] be blessed.
Galatians,3,9,So then those who are people of faith are blessed and made happy and favored by God [as partners in fellowship] with the believing and trusting Abraham.
Galatians,3,10,And all who depend on the Law [who are seeking to be justified by obedience to the Law of rituals] are under a curse and doomed to disappointment and destruction for it is written in the Scriptures Cursed (accursed devoted to destruction doomed to eternal punishment) be everyone who does not continue to abide (live and remain) by all the precepts and commands written in the Book of the Law and to practice them.
Galatians,3,11,Now it is evident that no person is justified (declared righteous and brought into right standing with God) through the Law for the Scripture says The man in right standing with God [the just the righteous] shall live by and out of faith and he who through and by faith is declared righteous and in right standing with God shall live.
Galatians,3,12,But the Law does not rest on faith [does not require faith has nothing to do with faith] for it itself says He who does them [the things prescribed by the Law] shall live by them [not by faith].
Galatians,3,13,Christ purchased our freedom [redeeming us] from the curse (doom) of the Law [and its condemnation] by [Himself] becoming a curse for us for it is written [in the Scriptures] Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree (is crucified);
Galatians,3,14,To the end that through [their receiving] Christ Jesus the blessing [promised] to Abraham might come upon the Gentiles so that we through faith might [all] receive [the realization of] the promise of the [Holy] Spirit.
Galatians,3,15,To speak in terms of human relations brethren [if] even a man makes a last will and testament (a merely human covenant) no one sets it aside or makes it void or adds to it when once it has been drawn up and signed (ratified confirmed).
Galatians,3,16,Now the promises (covenants agreements) were decreed and made to Abraham and his Seed (his Offspring his Heir). He [God] does not say And to seeds (descendants heirs) as if referring to many persons but And to your Seed (your Descendant your Heir) obviously referring to one individual Who is [none other than] Christ (the Messiah).
Galatians,3,17,This is my argument: The Law which began 430 years after the covenant [concerning the coming Messiah] does not and cannot annul the covenant previously established (ratified) by God so as to abolish the promise and make it void.
Galatians,3,18,For if the inheritance [of the promise depends on observing] the Law [as these false teachers would like you to believe] it no longer [depends] on the promise; however God gave it to Abraham [as a free gift solely] by virtue of His promise.
Galatians,3,19,What then was the purpose of the Law? It was added [later on after the promise to disclose and expose to men their guilt] because of transgressions and [to make men more conscious of the sinfulness] of sin; and it was intended to be in effect until the Seed (the Descendant the Heir) should come to and concerning Whom the promise had been made. And it [the Law] was arranged and ordained and appointed through the instrumentality of angels [and was given] by the hand (in the person) of a go-between [Moses an intermediary person between God and man].
Galatians,3,20,Now a go-between (intermediary) has to do with and implies more than one party [there can be no mediator with just one person]. Yet God is [only] one Person [and He was the sole party in giving that promise to Abraham. But the Law was a contract between two God and Israel; its validity was dependent on both].
Galatians,3,21,Is the Law then contrary and opposed to the promises of God? Of course not! For if a Law had been given which could confer [spiritual] life then righteousness and right standing with God would certainly have come by Law.
Galatians,3,22,But the Scriptures [picture all mankind as sinners] shut up and imprisoned by sin so that [the inheritance blessing] which was promised through faith in Jesus Christ (the Messiah) might be given (released delivered and committed) to [all] those who believe [who adhere to and trust in and rely on Him].
Galatians,3,23,Now before the faith came we were perpetually guarded under the Law kept in custody in preparation for the faith that was destined to be revealed (unveiled disclosed)
Galatians,3,24,So that the Law served [to us Jews] as our trainer [our guardian our guide to Christ to lead us] until Christ [came] that we might be justified (declared righteous put in right standing with God) by and through faith.
Galatians,3,25,But now that the faith has come we are no longer under a trainer (the guardian of our childhood).
Galatians,3,26,For in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God through faith.
Galatians,3,27,For as many [of you] as were baptized into Christ [into a spiritual union and communion with Christ the Anointed One the Messiah] have put on (clothed yourselves with) Christ.
Galatians,3,28,There is [now no distinction] neither Jew nor Greek there is neither slave nor free there is not male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
Galatians,3,29,And if you belong to Christ [are in Him Who is Abraham's Seed] then you are Abraham's offspring and [spiritual] heirs according to promise.
Galatians,4,1,NOW WHAT I mean is that as long as the inheritor (heir) is a child and under age he does not differ from a slave although he is the master of all the estate;
Galatians,4,2,But he is under guardians and administrators or trustees until the date fixed by his father.
Galatians,4,3,So we [Jewish Christians] also when we were minors were kept like slaves under [the rules of the Hebrew ritual and subject to] the elementary teachings of a system of external observations and regulations.
Galatians,4,4,But when the proper time had fully come God sent His Son born of a woman born subject to [the regulations of] the Law
Galatians,4,5,To purchase the freedom of (to ransom to redeem to atone for) those who were subject to the Law that we might be adopted and have sonship conferred upon us [and be recognized as God's sons].
Galatians,4,6,And because you [really] are [His] sons God has sent the [ Holy] Spirit of His Son into our hearts crying Abba (Father)! Father!
Galatians,4,7,Therefore you are no longer a slave (bond servant) but a son; and if a son then [it follows that you are] an heir by the aid of God through Christ.
Galatians,4,8,But at that previous time when you had not come to be acquainted with and understand and know the true God you [Gentiles] were in bondage to gods who by their very nature could not be gods at all [gods that really did not exist].
Galatians,4,9,Now however that you have come to be acquainted with and understand and know [the true] God or rather to be understood and known by God how can you turn back again to the weak and beggarly and worthless elementary things [ of all religions before Christ came] whose slaves you once more want to become?
Galatians,4,10,You observe [particular] days and months and seasons and years!
Galatians,4,11,I am alarmed [about you] lest I have labored among and over you to no purpose and in vain.
Galatians,4,12,Brethren I beg of you become as I am [free from the bondage of Jewish ritualism and ordinances] for I also have become as you are [ a Gentile]. You did me no wrong [ in the days when I first came to you; do not do it now].
Galatians,4,13,On the contrary you know that it was on account of a bodily ailment that [I remained and] preached the Gospel to you the first time.
Galatians,4,14,And [yet] although my physical condition was [such] a trial to you you did not regard it with contempt or scorn and loathe and reject me; but you received me as an angel of God [even] as Christ Jesus [Himself]!
Galatians,4,15,What has become of that blessed enjoyment and satisfaction and self-congratulation that once was yours [in what I taught you and in your regard for me]? For I bear you witness that you would have torn out your own eyes and have given them to me [to replace mine] if that were possible.
Galatians,4,16,Have I then become your enemy by telling the truth to you and dealing sincerely with you?
Galatians,4,17,These men [the Judaizing teachers] are zealously trying to dazzle you [paying court to you making much of you] but their purpose is not honorable or worthy or for any good. What they want to do is to isolate you [from us who oppose them] so that they may win you over to their side and get you to court their favor.
Galatians,4,18,It is always a fine thing [of course] to be zealously sought after [as you are provided that it is] for a good purpose and done by reason of purity of heart and life and not just when I am present with you!
Galatians,4,19,My little children for whom I am again suffering birth pangs until Christ is completely and permanently formed (molded) within you
Galatians,4,20,Would that I were with you now and could coax you vocally for I am fearful and perplexed about you!
Galatians,4,21,Tell me you who are bent on being under the Law will you listen to what the Law [really] says?
Galatians,4,22,For it is written that Abraham had two sons one by the bondmaid and one by the free woman.
Galatians,4,23,But whereas the child of the slave woman was born according to the flesh and had an ordinary birth the son of the free woman was born in fulfillment of the promise.
Galatians,4,24,Now all this is an allegory; these [two women] represent two covenants. One covenant originated from Mount Sinai [where the Law was given] and bears [children destined] for slavery; this is Hagar.
Galatians,4,25,Now Hagar is (stands for) Mount Sinai in Arabia and she corresponds to and belongs in the same category with the present Jerusalem for she is in bondage together with her children.
Galatians,4,26,But the Jerusalem above ( the Messianic kingdom of Christ) is free and she is our mother.
Galatians,4,27,For it is written in the Scriptures Rejoice O barren woman who has not given birth to children; break forth into a joyful shout you who are not feeling birth pangs for the desolate woman has many more children than she who has a husband.
Galatians,4,28,But we brethren are children [ not by physical descent as was Ishmael but] like Isaac born in virtue of promise.
Galatians,4,29,Yet [just] as at that time the child [of ordinary birth] born according to the flesh despised and persecuted him [who was born remarkably] according to [the promise and the working of] the [Holy] Spirit so it is now also.
Galatians,4,30,But what does the Scripture say? Cast out and send away the slave woman and her son for never shall the son of the slave woman be heir and share the inheritance with the son of the free woman.
Galatians,4,31,So brethren we [who are born again] are not children of a slave woman [ the natural] but of the free [ the supernatural].
Galatians,5,1,IN [this] freedom Christ has made us free [and completely liberated us]; stand fast then and do not be hampered and held ensnared and submit again to a yoke of slavery [which you have once put off].
Galatians,5,2,Notice it is I Paul who tells you that if you receive circumcision Christ will be of no profit (advantage avail) to you [ for if you distrust Him you can gain nothing from Him].
Galatians,5,3,I once more protest and testify to every man who receives circumcision that he is under obligation and bound to practice the whole of the Law and its ordinances.
Galatians,5,4,If you seek to be justified and declared righteous and to be given a right standing with God through the Law you are brought to nothing and so separated (severed) from Christ. You have fallen away from grace (from God's gracious favor and unmerited blessing).
Galatians,5,5,For we [not relying on the Law but] through the [Holy] Spirit's [help] by faith anticipate and wait for the blessing and good for which our righteousness and right standing with God [our conformity to His will in purpose thought and action causes us] to hope.
Galatians,5,6,For [if we are] in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything but only faith activated and energized and expressed and working through love.
Galatians,5,7,You were running the race nobly. Who has interfered in (hindered and stopped you from) your heeding and following the Truth?
Galatians,5,8,This [evil] persuasion is not from Him Who called you [Who invited you to freedom in Christ].
Galatians,5,9,A little leaven (a slight inclination to error or a few false teachers) leavens the whole lump [it perverts the whole conception of faith or misleads the whole church].
Galatians,5,10,[For my part] I have confidence [toward you] in the Lord that you will take no contrary view of the matter but will come to think with me. But he who is unsettling you whoever he is will have to bear the penalty.
Galatians,5,11,But brethren if I still preach circumcision [as some accuse me of doing as necessary to salvation] why am I still suffering persecution? In that case the cross has ceased to be a stumbling block and is made meaningless (done away).
Galatians,5,12,I wish those who unsettle and confuse you would [ go all the way and] cut themselves off!
Galatians,5,13,For you brethren were [indeed] called to freedom; only [do not let your] freedom be an incentive to your flesh and an opportunity or excuse [for selfishness] but through love you should serve one another.
Galatians,5,14,For the whole Law [concerning human relationships] is complied with in the one precept You shall love your neighbor as [you do] yourself.
Galatians,5,15,But if you bite and devour one another [in partisan strife] be careful that you [and your whole fellowship] are not consumed by one another.
Galatians,5,16,But I say walk and live [habitually] in the [Holy] Spirit [responsive to and controlled and guided by the Spirit]; then you will certainly not gratify the cravings and desires of the flesh (of human nature without God).
Galatians,5,17,For the desires of the flesh are opposed to the [Holy] Spirit and the [desires of the] Spirit are opposed to the flesh (godless human nature); for these are antagonistic to each other [continually withstanding and in conflict with each other] so that you are not free but are prevented from doing what you desire to do.
Galatians,5,18,But if you are guided (led) by the [Holy] Spirit you are not subject to the Law.
Galatians,5,19,Now the doings (practices) of the flesh are clear (obvious): they are immorality impurity indecency
Galatians,5,20,Idolatry sorcery enmity strife jealousy anger (ill temper) selfishness divisions (dissensions) party spirit (factions sects with peculiar opinions heresies)
Galatians,5,21,Envy drunkenness carousing and the like. I warn you beforehand just as I did previously that those who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
Galatians,5,22,But the fruit of the [Holy] Spirit [the work which His presence within accomplishes] is love joy (gladness) peace patience (an even temper forbearance) kindness goodness (benevolence) faithfulness
Galatians,5,23,Gentleness (meekness humility) self-control (self-restraint continence). Against such things there is no law [ that can bring a charge].
Galatians,5,24,And those who belong to Christ Jesus (the Messiah) have crucified the flesh (the godless human nature) with its passions and appetites and desires.
Galatians,5,25,If we live by the [Holy] Spirit let us also walk by the Spirit. [If by the Holy Spirit we have our life in God let us go forward walking in line our conduct controlled by the Spirit.]
Galatians,5,26,Let us not become vainglorious and self-conceited competitive and challenging and provoking and irritating to one another envying and being jealous of one another.
Galatians,6,1,BRETHREN IF any person is overtaken in misconduct or sin of any sort you who are spiritual [who are responsive to and controlled by the Spirit] should set him right and restore and reinstate him without any sense of superiority and with all gentleness keeping an attentive eye on yourself lest you should be tempted also.
Galatians,6,2,Bear (endure carry) one another's burdens and troublesome moral faults and in this way fulfill and observe perfectly the law of Christ (the Messiah) and complete what is lacking [in your obedience to it].
Galatians,6,3,For if any person thinks himself to be somebody [too important to condescend to shoulder another's load] when he is nobody [of superiority except in his own estimation] he deceives and deludes and cheats himself.
Galatians,6,4,But let every person carefully scrutinize and examine and test his own conduct and his own work. He can then have the personal satisfaction and joy of doing something commendable [ in itself alone] without [resorting to] boastful comparison with his neighbor.
Galatians,6,5,For every person will have to bear ( be equal to understanding and calmly receive) his own [ little] load [of oppressive faults].
Galatians,6,6,Let him who receives instruction in the Word [of God] share all good things with his teacher [contributing to his support].
Galatians,6,7,Do not be deceived and deluded and misled; God will not allow Himself to be sneered at (scorned disdained or mocked by mere pretensions or professions or by His precepts being set aside.) [He inevitably deludes himself who attempts to delude God.] For whatever a man sows that and that only is what he will reap.
Galatians,6,8,For he who sows to his own flesh (lower nature sensuality) will from the flesh reap decay and ruin and destruction but he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.
Galatians,6,9,And let us not lose heart and grow weary and faint in acting nobly and doing right for in due time and at the appointed season we shall reap if we do not loosen and relax our courage and faint.
Galatians,6,10,So then as occasion and opportunity open up to us let us do good [ morally] to all people [not only being useful or profitable to them but also doing what is for their spiritual good and advantage]. Be mindful to be a blessing especially to those of the household of faith [those who belong to God's family with you the believers].
Galatians,6,11,See with what large letters I am writing with my own hand. [ Mark carefully these closing words of mine.]
Galatians,6,12,Those who want to make a good impression and a fine show in the flesh would try to compel you to receive circumcision simply so that they may escape being persecuted for allegiance to the cross of Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One).
Galatians,6,13,For even the circumcised [Jews] themselves do not [really] keep the Law but they want to have you circumcised in order that they may glory in your flesh (your subjection to external rites).
Galatians,6,14,But far be it from me to glory [in anything or anyone] except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) through Whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world!
Galatians,6,15,For neither is circumcision [now] of any importance nor uncircumcision but [only] a new creation [the result of a new birth and a new nature in Christ Jesus the Messiah].
Galatians,6,16,Peace and mercy be upon all who walk by this rule [who discipline themselves and regulate their lives by this principle] even upon the [true] Israel of God!
Galatians,6,17,From now on let no person trouble me [by making it necessary for me to vindicate my apostolic authority and the divine truth of my Gospel] for I bear on my body the [brand] marks of the Lord Jesus [the wounds scars and other outward evidence of persecutions--these testify to His ownership of me]!
Galatians,6,18,The grace (spiritual favor blessing) of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Anointed One the Messiah) be with your spirit brethren. Amen (so be it).
Ephesians,1,1,PAUL AN apostle (special messenger) of Christ Jesus (the Messiah) by the divine will (the purpose and the choice of God) to the saints (the consecrated set-apart ones) at Ephesus who are also faithful and loyal and steadfast in Christ Jesus:
Ephesians,1,2,May grace (God's unmerited favor) and spiritual peace [which means peace with God and harmony unity and undisturbedness] be yours from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
Ephesians,1,3,May blessing (praise laudation and eulogy) be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) Who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual (given by the Holy Spirit) blessing in the heavenly realm!
Ephesians,1,4,Even as [in His love] He chose us [actually picked us out for Himself as His own] in Christ before the foundation of the world that we should be holy (consecrated and set apart for Him) and blameless in His sight even above reproach before Him in love.
Ephesians,1,5,For He foreordained us (destined us planned in love for us) to be adopted (revealed) as His own children through Jesus Christ in accordance with the purpose of His will [ because it pleased Him and was His kind intent]--
Ephesians,1,6,[So that we might be] to the praise and the commendation of His glorious grace (favor and mercy) which He so freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.
Ephesians,1,7,In Him we have redemption (deliverance and salvation) through His blood the remission (forgiveness) of our offenses (shortcomings and trespasses) in accordance with the riches and the generosity of His gracious favor
Ephesians,1,8,Which He lavished upon us in every kind of wisdom and understanding (practical insight and prudence)
Ephesians,1,9,Making known to us the mystery (secret) of His will (of His plan of His purpose). [And it is this:] In accordance with His good pleasure (His merciful intention) which He had previously purposed and set forth in Him
Ephesians,1,10,[He planned] for the maturity of the times and the climax of the ages to unify all things and head them up and consummate them in Christ [both] things in heaven and things on the earth.
Ephesians,1,11,In Him we also were made [God's] heritage (portion) and we obtained an inheritance; for we had been foreordained (chosen and appointed beforehand) in accordance with His purpose Who works out everything in agreement with the counsel and design of His [own] will
Ephesians,1,12,So that we who first hoped in Christ [who first put our confidence in Him have been destined and appointed to] live for the praise of His glory!
Ephesians,1,13,In Him you also who have heard the Word of Truth the glad tidings (Gospel) of your salvation and have believed in and adhered to and relied on Him were stamped with the seal of the long-promised Holy Spirit.
Ephesians,1,14,That [Spirit] is the guarantee of our inheritance [the firstfruits the pledge and foretaste the down payment on our heritage] in anticipation of its full redemption and our acquiring [complete] possession of it--to the praise of His glory.
Ephesians,1,15,For this reason because I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints (the people of God)
Ephesians,1,16,I do not cease to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers.
Ephesians,1,17,[For I always pray to] the God of our Lord Jesus Christ the Father of glory that He may grant you a spirit of wisdom and revelation [of insight into mysteries and secrets] in the [deep and intimate] knowledge of Him
Ephesians,1,18,By having the eyes of your heart flooded with light so that you can know and understand the hope to which He has called you and how rich is His glorious inheritance in the saints (His set-apart ones)
Ephesians,1,19,And [so that you can know and understand] what is the immeasurable and unlimited and surpassing greatness of His power in and for us who believe as demonstrated in the working of His mighty strength
Ephesians,1,20,Which He exerted in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His [own] right hand in the heavenly [places]
Ephesians,1,21,Far above all rule and authority and power and dominion and every name that is named [above every title that can be conferred] not only in this age and in this world but also in the age and the world which are to come.
Ephesians,1,22,And He has put all things under His feet and has appointed Him the universal and supreme Head of the church [a headship exercised throughout the church]
Ephesians,1,23,Which is His body the fullness of Him Who fills all in all [for in that body lives the full measure of Him Who makes everything complete and Who fills everything everywhere with Himself].
Ephesians,2,1,AND YOU [He made alive] when you were dead (slain) by [your] trespasses and sins
Ephesians,2,2,In which at one time you walked [habitually]. You were following the course and fashion of this world [were under the sway of the tendency of this present age] following the prince of the power of the air. [You were obedient to and under the control of] the [demon] spirit that still constantly works in the sons of disobedience [the careless the rebellious and the unbelieving who go against the purposes of God].
Ephesians,2,3,Among these we as well as you once lived and conducted ourselves in the passions of our flesh [our behavior governed by our corrupt and sensual nature] obeying the impulses of the flesh and the thoughts of the mind [our cravings dictated by our senses and our dark imaginings]. We were then by nature children of [God's] wrath and heirs of [His] indignation like the rest of mankind.
Ephesians,2,4,But God--so rich is He in His mercy! Because of and in order to satisfy the great and wonderful and intense love with which He loved us
Ephesians,2,5,Even when we were dead (slain) by [our own] shortcomings and trespasses He made us alive together in fellowship and in union with Christ; [He gave us the very life of Christ Himself the same new life with which He quickened Him for] it is by grace (His favor and mercy which you did not deserve) that you are saved ( delivered from judgment and made partakers of Christ's salvation).
Ephesians,2,6,And He raised us up together with Him and made us sit down together [giving us joint seating with Him] in the heavenly sphere [by virtue of our being] in Christ Jesus (the Messiah the Anointed One).
Ephesians,2,7,He did this that He might clearly demonstrate through the ages to come the immeasurable (limitless surpassing) riches of His free grace (His unmerited favor) in [His] kindness and goodness of heart toward us in Christ Jesus.
Ephesians,2,8,For it is by free grace (God's unmerited favor) that you are saved ( delivered from judgment and made partakers of Christ's salvation) through [your] faith. And this [salvation] is not of yourselves [of your own doing it came not through your own striving] but it is the gift of God;
Ephesians,2,9,Not because of works [not the fulfillment of the Law's demands] lest any man should boast. [It is not the result of what anyone can possibly do so no one can pride himself in it or take glory to himself.]
Ephesians,2,10,For we are God's [own] handiwork (His workmanship) recreated in Christ Jesus [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time] that we should walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live].
Ephesians,2,11,Therefore remember that at one time you were Gentiles (heathens) in the flesh called Uncircumcision by those who called themselves Circumcision [itself a mere mark] in the flesh made by human hands.
Ephesians,2,12,[Remember] that you were at that time separated (living apart) from Christ [excluded from all part in Him] utterly estranged and outlawed from the rights of Israel as a nation and strangers with no share in the sacred compacts of the [Messianic] promise [with no knowledge of or right in God's agreements His covenants]. And you had no hope (no promise); you were in the world without God.
Ephesians,2,13,But now in Christ Jesus you who once were [so] far away through (by in) the blood of Christ have been brought near.
Ephesians,2,14,For He is [Himself] our peace (our bond of unity and harmony). He has made us both [Jew and Gentile] one [body] and has broken down (destroyed abolished) the hostile dividing wall between us
Ephesians,2,15,By abolishing in His [own crucified] flesh the enmity [caused by] the Law with its decrees and ordinances [which He annulled]; that He from the two might create in Himself one new man [one new quality of humanity out of the two] so making peace.
Ephesians,2,16,And [He designed] to reconcile to God both [Jew and Gentile united] in a single body by means of His cross thereby killing the mutual enmity and bringing the feud to an end.
Ephesians,2,17,And He came and preached the glad tidings of peace to you who were afar off and [peace] to those who were near.
Ephesians,2,18,For it is through Him that we both [whether far off or near] now have an introduction (access) by one [Holy] Spirit to the Father [so that we are able to approach Him].
Ephesians,2,19,Therefore you are no longer outsiders (exiles migrants and aliens excluded from the rights of citizens) but you now share citizenship with the saints (God's own people consecrated and set apart for Himself); and you belong to God's [own] household.
Ephesians,2,20,You are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ Jesus Himself the chief Cornerstone.
Ephesians,2,21,In Him the whole structure is joined (bound welded) together harmoniously and it continues to rise (grow increase) into a holy temple in the Lord [a sanctuary dedicated consecrated and sacred to the presence of the Lord].
Ephesians,2,22,In Him [and in fellowship with one another] you yourselves also are being built up [into this structure] with the rest to form a fixed abode (dwelling place) of God in (by through) the Spirit.
Ephesians,3,1,FOR THIS reason [ because I preached that you are thus built up together] I Paul [am] the prisoner of Jesus the Christ for the sake and on behalf of you Gentiles--
Ephesians,3,2,Assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace (His unmerited favor) that was entrusted to me [to dispense to you] for your benefit
Ephesians,3,3,[And] that the mystery (secret) was made known to me and I was allowed to comprehend it by direct revelation as I already briefly wrote you.
Ephesians,3,4,When you read this you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ.
Ephesians,3,5,[This mystery] was never disclosed to human beings in past generations as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles (consecrated messengers) and prophets by the [Holy] Spirit.
Ephesians,3,6,[It is this:] that the Gentiles are now to be fellow heirs [with the Jews] members of the same body and joint partakers [sharing] in the same divine promise in Christ through [their acceptance of] the glad tidings (the Gospel).
Ephesians,3,7,Of this [Gospel] I was made a minister according to the gift of God's free grace (undeserved favor) which was bestowed on me by the exercise (the working in all its effectiveness) of His power.
Ephesians,3,8,To me though I am the very least of all the saints (God's consecrated people) this grace (favor privilege) was granted and graciously entrusted: to proclaim to the Gentiles the unending (boundless fathomless incalculable and exhaustless) riches of Christ [wealth which no human being could have searched out]
Ephesians,3,9,Also to enlighten all men and make plain to them what is the plan [regarding the Gentiles and providing for the salvation of all men] of the mystery kept hidden through the ages and concealed until now in [the mind of] God Who created all things by Christ Jesus.
Ephesians,3,10,[The purpose is] that through the church the complicated many-sided wisdom of God in all its infinite variety and innumerable aspects might now be made known to the angelic rulers and authorities (principalities and powers) in the heavenly sphere.
Ephesians,3,11,This is in accordance with the terms of the eternal and timeless purpose which He has realized and carried into effect in [the person of] Christ Jesus our Lord
Ephesians,3,12,In Whom because of our faith in Him we dare to have the boldness (courage and confidence) of free access (an unreserved approach to God with freedom and without fear).
Ephesians,3,13,So I ask you not to lose heart [not to faint or become despondent through fear] at what I am suffering in your behalf. [Rather glory in it] for it is an honor to you.
Ephesians,3,14,For this reason [ seeing the greatness of this plan by which you are built together in Christ] I bow my knees before the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
Ephesians,3,15,For Whom every family in heaven and on earth is named [that Father from Whom all fatherhood takes its title and derives its name].
Ephesians,3,16,May He grant you out of the rich treasury of His glory to be strengthened and reinforced with mighty power in the inner man by the [Holy] Spirit [Himself indwelling your innermost being and personality].
Ephesians,3,17,May Christ through your faith [actually] dwell (settle down abide make His permanent home) in your hearts! May you be rooted deep in love and founded securely on love
Ephesians,3,18,That you may have the power and be strong to apprehend and grasp with all the saints [God's devoted people the experience of that love] what is the breadth and length and height and depth [of it];
Ephesians,3,19,[That you may really come] to know [practically through experience for yourselves] the love of Christ which far surpasses mere knowledge [without experience]; that you may be filled [through all your being] unto all the fullness of God [may have the richest measure of the divine Presence and become a body wholly filled and flooded with God Himself]!
Ephesians,3,20,Now to Him Who by (in consequence of) the [action of His] power that is at work within us is able to [carry out His purpose and] do superabundantly far over and above all that we [dare] ask or think [infinitely beyond our highest prayers desires thoughts hopes or dreams]--
Ephesians,3,21,To Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations forever and ever. Amen (so be it).
Ephesians,4,1,I THEREFORE the prisoner for the Lord appeal to and beg you to walk (lead a life) worthy of the [divine] calling to which you have been called [with behavior that is a credit to the summons to God's service
Ephesians,4,2,Living as becomes you] with complete lowliness of mind (humility) and meekness (unselfishness gentleness mildness) with patience bearing with one another and making allowances because you love one another.
Ephesians,4,3,Be eager and strive earnestly to guard and keep the harmony and oneness of [and produced by] the Spirit in the binding power of peace.
Ephesians,4,4,[There is] one body and one Spirit--just as there is also one hope [that belongs] to the calling you received--
Ephesians,4,5,[There is] one Lord one faith one baptism
Ephesians,4,6,One God and Father of [us] all Who is above all [Sovereign over all] pervading all and [living] in [us] all.
Ephesians,4,7,Yet grace (God's unmerited favor) was given to each of us individually [not indiscriminately but in different ways] in proportion to the measure of Christ's [rich and bounteous] gift.
Ephesians,4,8,Therefore it is said When He ascended on high He led captivity captive [He led a train of vanquished foes] and He bestowed gifts on men.
Ephesians,4,9,[But He ascended?] Now what can this He ascended mean but that He had previously descended from [the heights of] heaven into [the depths] the lower parts of the earth?
Ephesians,4,10,He Who descended is the [very] same as He Who also has ascended high above all the heavens that He [His presence] might fill all things (the whole universe from the lowest to the highest).
Ephesians,4,11,And His gifts were [varied; He Himself appointed and gave men to us] some to be apostles (special messengers) some prophets (inspired preachers and expounders) some evangelists (preachers of the Gospel traveling missionaries) some pastors (shepherds of His flock) and teachers.
Ephesians,4,12,His intention was the perfecting and the full equipping of the saints (His consecrated people) [that they should do] the work of ministering toward building up Christ's body (the church)
Ephesians,4,13,[That it might develop] until we all attain oneness in the faith and in the comprehension of the [ full and accurate] knowledge of the Son of God that [we might arrive] at really mature manhood (the completeness of personality which is nothing less than the standard height of Christ's own perfection) the measure of the stature of the fullness of the Christ and the completeness found in Him.
Ephesians,4,14,So then we may no longer be children tossed [like ships] to and fro between chance gusts of teaching and wavering with every changing wind of doctrine [the prey of] the cunning and cleverness of unscrupulous men [gamblers engaged] in every shifting form of trickery in inventing errors to mislead.
Ephesians,4,15,Rather let our lives lovingly express truth [in all things speaking truly dealing truly living truly]. Enfolded in love let us grow up in every way and in all things into Him Who is the Head [even] Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One).
Ephesians,4,16,For because of Him the whole body (the church in all its various parts) closely joined and firmly knit together by the joints and ligaments with which it is supplied when each part [with power adapted to its need] is working properly [in all its functions] grows to full maturity building itself up in love.
Ephesians,4,17,So this I say and solemnly testify in [the name of] the Lord [as in His presence] that you must no longer live as the heathen (the Gentiles) do in their perverseness [in the folly vanity and emptiness of their souls and the futility] of their minds.
Ephesians,4,18,Their moral understanding is darkened and their reasoning is beclouded. [They are] alienated (estranged self-banished) from the life of God [with no share in it; this is] because of the ignorance (the want of knowledge and perception the willful blindness) that is deep-seated in them due to their hardness of heart [to the insensitiveness of their moral nature].
Ephesians,4,19,In their spiritual apathy they have become callous and past feeling and reckless and have abandoned themselves [a prey] to unbridled sensuality eager and greedy to indulge in every form of impurity [that their depraved desires may suggest and demand].
Ephesians,4,20,But you did not so learn Christ!
Ephesians,4,21,Assuming that you have really heard Him and been taught by Him as [all] Truth is in Jesus [embodied and personified in Him]
Ephesians,4,22,Strip yourselves of your former nature [put off and discard your old unrenewed self] which characterized your previous manner of life and becomes corrupt through lusts and desires that spring from delusion;
Ephesians,4,23,And be constantly renewed in the spirit of your mind [having a fresh mental and spiritual attitude]
Ephesians,4,24,And put on the new nature (the regenerate self) created in God's image [Godlike] in true righteousness and holiness.
Ephesians,4,25,Therefore rejecting all falsity and being done now with it let everyone express the truth with his neighbor for we are all parts of one body and members one of another.
Ephesians,4,26,When angry do not sin; do not ever let your wrath (your exasperation your fury or indignation) last until the sun goes down.
Ephesians,4,27,Leave no [such] room or foothold for the devil [give no opportunity to him].
Ephesians,4,28,Let the thief steal no more but rather let him be industrious making an honest living with his own hands so that he may be able to give to those in need.
Ephesians,4,29,Let no foul or polluting language nor evil word nor unwholesome or worthless talk [ever] come out of your mouth but only such [speech] as is good and beneficial to the spiritual progress of others as is fitting to the need and the occasion that it may be a blessing and give grace (God's favor) to those who hear it.
Ephesians,4,30,And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God [do not offend or vex or sadden Him] by Whom you were sealed (marked branded as God's own secured) for the day of redemption (of final deliverance through Christ from evil and the consequences of sin).
Ephesians,4,31,Let all bitterness and indignation and wrath (passion rage bad temper) and resentment (anger animosity) and quarreling (brawling clamor contention) and slander (evil-speaking abusive or blasphemous language) be banished from you with all malice (spite ill will or baseness of any kind).
Ephesians,4,32,And become useful and helpful and kind to one another tenderhearted (compassionate understanding loving-hearted) forgiving one another [readily and freely] as God in Christ forgave you.
Ephesians,5,1,THEREFORE BE imitators of God [copy Him and follow His example] as well-beloved children [imitate their father].
Ephesians,5,2,And walk in love [esteeming and delighting in one another] as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us a slain offering and sacrifice to God [for you so that it became] a sweet fragrance.
Ephesians,5,3,But immorality (sexual vice) and all impurity [ of lustful rich wasteful living] or greediness must not even be named among you as is fitting and proper among saints (God's consecrated people).
Ephesians,5,4,Let there be no filthiness (obscenity indecency) nor foolish and sinful (silly and corrupt) talk nor coarse jesting which are not fitting or becoming; but instead voice your thankfulness [to God].
Ephesians,5,5,For be sure of this: that no person practicing sexual vice or impurity in thought or in life or one who is covetous [who has lustful desire for the property of others and is greedy for gain]--for he [in effect] is an idolater--has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
Ephesians,5,6,Let no one delude and deceive you with empty excuses and groundless arguments [for these sins] for through these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of rebellion and disobedience.
Ephesians,5,7,So do not associate or be sharers with them.
Ephesians,5,8,For once you were darkness but now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of Light [lead the lives of those native-born to the Light].
Ephesians,5,9,For the fruit (the effect the product) of the Light or the Spirit [consists] in every form of kindly goodness uprightness of heart and trueness of life.
Ephesians,5,10,And try to learn [in your experience] what is pleasing to the Lord [let your lives be constant proofs of what is most acceptable to Him].
Ephesians,5,11,Take no part in and have no fellowship with the fruitless deeds and enterprises of darkness but instead [let your lives be so in contrast as to] expose and reprove and convict them.
Ephesians,5,12,For it is a shame even to speak of or mention the things that [such people] practice in secret.
Ephesians,5,13,But when anything is exposed and reproved by the light it is made visible and clear; and where everything is visible and clear there is light.
Ephesians,5,14,Therefore He says Awake O sleeper and arise from the dead and Christ shall shine (make day dawn) upon you and give you light.
Ephesians,5,15,Look carefully then how you walk! Live purposefully and worthily and accurately not as the unwise and witless but as wise (sensible intelligent people)
Ephesians,5,16,Making the very most of the time [buying up each opportunity] because the days are evil.
Ephesians,5,17,Therefore do not be vague and thoughtless and foolish but understanding and firmly grasping what the will of the Lord is.
Ephesians,5,18,And do not get drunk with wine for that is debauchery; but ever be filled and stimulated with the [Holy] Spirit.
Ephesians,5,19,Speak out to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs offering praise with voices [ and instruments] and making melody with all your heart to the Lord
Ephesians,5,20,At all times and for everything giving thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father.
Ephesians,5,21,Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One).
Ephesians,5,22,Wives be subject (be submissive and adapt yourselves) to your own husbands as [a service] to the Lord.
Ephesians,5,23,For the husband is head of the wife as Christ is the Head of the church Himself the Savior of [His] body.
Ephesians,5,24,As the church is subject to Christ so let wives also be subject in everything to their husbands.
Ephesians,5,25,Husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her
Ephesians,5,26,So that He might sanctify her having cleansed her by the washing of water with the Word
Ephesians,5,27,That He might present the church to Himself in glorious splendor without spot or wrinkle or any such things [that she might be holy and faultless].
Ephesians,5,28,Even so husbands should love their wives as [being in a sense] their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.
Ephesians,5,29,For no man ever hated his own flesh but nourishes and carefully protects and cherishes it as Christ does the church
Ephesians,5,30,Because we are members (parts) of His body.
Ephesians,5,31,For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh.
Ephesians,5,32,This mystery is very great but I speak concerning [the relation of] Christ and the church.
Ephesians,5,33,However let each man of you [without exception] love his wife as [being in a sense] his very own self; and let the wife see that she respects and reverences her husband [ that she notices him regards him honors him prefers him venerates and esteems him; and that she defers to him praises him and loves and admires him exceedingly]. [I Pet. 3:2.]
Ephesians,6,1,CHILDREN OBEY your parents in the Lord [as His representatives] for this is just and right.
Ephesians,6,2,Honor (esteem and value as precious) your father and your mother--this is the first commandment with a promise--
Ephesians,6,3,That all may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth.
Ephesians,6,4,Fathers do not irritate and provoke your children to anger [do not exasperate them to resentment] but rear them [tenderly] in the training and discipline and the counsel and admonition of the Lord.
Ephesians,6,5,Servants (slaves) be obedient to those who are your physical masters having respect for them and eager concern to please them in singleness of motive and with all your heart as [service] to Christ [Himself]--
Ephesians,6,6,Not in the way of eye-service [as if they were watching you] and only to please men but as servants (slaves) of Christ doing the will of God heartily and with your whole soul;
Ephesians,6,7,Rendering service readily with goodwill as to the Lord and not to men
Ephesians,6,8,Knowing that for whatever good anyone does he will receive his reward from the Lord whether he is slave or free.
Ephesians,6,9,You masters act on the same [principle] toward them and give up threatening and using violent and abusive words knowing that He Who is both their Master and yours is in heaven and that there is no respect of persons (no partiality) with Him.
Ephesians,6,10,In conclusion be strong in the Lord [be empowered through your union with Him]; draw your strength from Him [that strength which His boundless might provides].
Ephesians,6,11,Put on God's whole armor [the armor of a heavy-armed soldier which God supplies] that you may be able successfully to stand up against [all] the strategies and the deceits of the devil.
Ephesians,6,12,For we are not wrestling with flesh and blood [contending only with physical opponents] but against the despotisms against the powers against [the master spirits who are] the world rulers of this present darkness against the spirit forces of wickedness in the heavenly (supernatural) sphere.
Ephesians,6,13,Therefore put on God's complete armor that you may be able to resist and stand your ground on the evil day [of danger] and having done all [the crisis demands] to stand [firmly in your place].
Ephesians,6,14,Stand therefore [hold your ground] having tightened the belt of truth around your loins and having put on the breastplate of integrity and of moral rectitude and right standing with God
Ephesians,6,15,And having shod your feet in preparation [to face the enemy with the firm-footed stability the promptness and the readiness produced by the good news] of the Gospel of peace.
Ephesians,6,16,Lift up over all the [covering] shield of saving faith upon which you can quench all the flaming missiles of the wicked [one].
Ephesians,6,17,And take the helmet of salvation and the sword that the Spirit wields which is the Word of God.
Ephesians,6,18,Pray at all times (on every occasion in every season) in the Spirit with all [manner of] prayer and entreaty. To that end keep alert and watch with strong purpose and perseverance interceding in behalf of all the saints (God's consecrated people).
Ephesians,6,19,And [pray] also for me that [freedom of] utterance may be given me that I may open my mouth to proclaim boldly the mystery of the good news (the Gospel)
Ephesians,6,20,For which I am an ambassador in a coupling chain [in prison. Pray] that I may declare it boldly and courageously as I ought to do.
Ephesians,6,21,Now that you may know how I am and what I am doing Tychicus the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord [and His service] will tell you everything.
Ephesians,6,22,I have sent him to you for this very purpose that you may know how we are and that he may console and cheer and encourage and strengthen your hearts.
Ephesians,6,23,Peace be to the brethren and love joined with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One).
Ephesians,6,24,Grace (God's undeserved favor) be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with undying and incorruptible [love]. Amen (so let it be).
Philippians,1,1,PAUL AND Timothy bond servants of Christ Jesus (the Messiah) to all the saints (God's consecrated people) in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi with the bishops (overseers) and deacons (assistants):
Philippians,1,2,Grace (favor and blessing) to you and [heart] peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah).
Philippians,1,3,I thank my God in all my remembrance of you.
Philippians,1,4,In every prayer of mine I always make my entreaty and petition for you all with joy (delight).
Philippians,1,5,[I thank my God] for your fellowship (your sympathetic cooperation and contributions and partnership) in advancing the good news (the Gospel) from the first day [you heard it] until now.
Philippians,1,6,And I am convinced and sure of this very thing that He Who began a good work in you will continue until the day of Jesus Christ [right up to the time of His return] developing [that good work] and perfecting and bringing it to full completion in you.
Philippians,1,7,It is right and appropriate for me to have this confidence and feel this way about you all because you have me in your heart and I hold you in my heart as partakers and sharers one and all with me of grace (God's unmerited favor and spiritual blessing). [This is true] both when I am shut up in prison and when I am out in the defense and confirmation of the good news (the Gospel).
Philippians,1,8,For God is my witness how I long for and pursue you all with love in the tender mercy of Christ Jesus [Himself]!
Philippians,1,9,And this I pray: that your love may abound yet more and more and extend to its fullest development in knowledge and all keen insight [that your love may display itself in greater depth of acquaintance and more comprehensive discernment]
Philippians,1,10,So that you may surely learn to sense what is vital and approve and prize what is excellent and of real value [recognizing the highest and the best and distinguishing the moral differences] and that you may be untainted and pure and unerring and blameless [so that with hearts sincere and certain and unsullied you may approach] the day of Christ [not stumbling nor causing others to stumble].
Philippians,1,11,May you abound in and be filled with the fruits of righteousness (of right standing with God and right doing) which come through Jesus Christ (the Anointed One) to the honor and praise of God [ that His glory may be both manifested and recognized].
Philippians,1,12,Now I want you to know and continue to rest assured brethren that what [has happened] to me [this imprisonment] has actually only served to advance and give a renewed impetus to the [spreading of the] good news (the Gospel).
Philippians,1,13,So much is this a fact that throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest [here] my imprisonment has become generally known to be in Christ [that I am a prisoner in His service and for Him].
Philippians,1,14,And [also] most of the brethren have derived fresh confidence in the Lord because of my chains and are much more bold to speak and publish fearlessly the Word of God [acting with more freedom and indifference to the consequences].
Philippians,1,15,Some it is true [actually] preach Christ (the Messiah) [for no better reason than] out of envy and rivalry (party spirit) but others are doing so out of a loyal spirit and goodwill.
Philippians,1,16,The latter [proclaim Christ] out of love because they recognize and know that I am [providentially] put here for the defense of the good news (the Gospel).
Philippians,1,17,But the former preach Christ out of a party spirit insincerely [out of no pure motive but thinking to annoy me] supposing they are making my bondage more bitter and my chains more galling.
Philippians,1,18,But what does it matter so long as either way whether in pretense [for personal ends] or in all honesty [for the furtherance of the Truth] Christ is being proclaimed? And in that I [now] rejoice yes and I shall rejoice [hereafter] also.
Philippians,1,19,For I am well assured and indeed know that through your prayers and a bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (the Messiah) this will turn out for my preservation (for the spiritual health and welfare of my own soul) and avail toward the saving work of the Gospel.
Philippians,1,20,This is in keeping with my own eager desire and persistent expectation and hope that I shall not disgrace myself nor be put to shame in anything; but that with the utmost freedom of speech and unfailing courage now as always heretofore Christ (the Messiah) will be magnified and get glory and praise in this body of mine and be boldly exalted in my person whether through (by) life or through (by) death.
Philippians,1,21,For me to live is Christ [His life in me] and to die is gain [the gain of the glory of eternity].
Philippians,1,22,If however it is to be life in the flesh and I am to live on here that means fruitful service for me; so I can say nothing as to my personal preference [I cannot choose]
Philippians,1,23,But I am hard pressed between the two. My yearning desire is to depart (to be free of this world to set forth) and be with Christ for that is far far better;
Philippians,1,24,But to remain in my body is more needful and essential for your sake.
Philippians,1,25,Since I am convinced of this I know that I shall remain and stay by you all to promote your progress and joy in believing
Philippians,1,26,So that in me you may have abundant cause for exultation and glorying in Christ Jesus through my coming to you again.
Philippians,1,27,Only be sure as citizens so to conduct yourselves [that] your manner of life [will be] worthy of the good news (the Gospel) of Christ so that whether I [do] come and see you or am absent I may hear this of you: that you are standing firm in united spirit and purpose striving side by side and contending with a single mind for the faith of the glad tidings (the Gospel).
Philippians,1,28,And do not [for a moment] be frightened or intimidated in anything by your opponents and adversaries for such [constancy and fearlessness] will be a clear sign (proof and seal) to them of [their impending] destruction but [a sure token and evidence] of your deliverance and salvation and that from God.
Philippians,1,29,For you have been granted [the privilege] for Christ's sake not only to believe in (adhere to rely on and trust in) Him but also to suffer in His behalf.
Philippians,1,30,So you are engaged in the same conflict which you saw me [wage] and which you now hear to be mine [still].
Philippians,2,1,SO BY whatever [appeal to you there is in our mutual dwelling in Christ by whatever] strengthening and consoling and encouraging [our relationship] in Him [affords] by whatever persuasive incentive there is in love by whatever participation in the [Holy] Spirit [we share] and by whatever depth of affection and compassionate sympathy
Philippians,2,2,Fill up and complete my joy by living in harmony and being of the same mind and one in purpose having the same love being in full accord and of one harmonious mind and intention.
Philippians,2,3,Do nothing from factional motives [through contentiousness strife selfishness or for unworthy ends] or prompted by conceit and empty arrogance. Instead in the true spirit of humility (lowliness of mind) let each regard the others as better than and superior to himself [thinking more highly of one another than you do of yourselves].
Philippians,2,4,Let each of you esteem and look upon and be concerned for not [merely] his own interests but also each for the interests of others.
Philippians,2,5,Let this same attitude and purpose and [humble] mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus: [Let Him be your example in humility:]
Philippians,2,6,Who although being essentially one with God and in the form of God [ possessing the fullness of the attributes which make God God] did not think this equality with God was a thing to be eagerly grasped or retained
Philippians,2,7,But stripped Himself [of all privileges and rightful dignity] so as to assume the guise of a servant (slave) in that He became like men and was born a human being.
Philippians,2,8,And after He had appeared in human form He abased and humbled Himself [still further] and carried His obedience to the extreme of death even the death of the cross!
Philippians,2,9,Therefore [because He stooped so low] God has highly exalted Him and has freely bestowed on Him the name that is above every name
Philippians,2,10,That in (at) the name of Jesus every knee should (must) bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth
Philippians,2,11,And every tongue [ frankly and openly] confess and acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
Philippians,2,12,Therefore my dear ones as you have always obeyed [my suggestions] so now not only [with the enthusiasm you would show] in my presence but much more because I am absent work out (cultivate carry out to the goal and fully complete) your own salvation with reverence and awe and trembling (self-distrust with serious caution tenderness of conscience watchfulness against temptation timidly shrinking from whatever might offend God and discredit the name of Christ).
Philippians,2,13,[Not in your own strength] for it is God Who is all the while effectually at work in you [energizing and creating in you the power and desire] both to will and to work for His good pleasure and satisfaction and delight.
Philippians,2,14,Do all things without grumbling and faultfinding and complaining [ against God] and questioning and doubting [among yourselves]
Philippians,2,15,That you may show yourselves to be blameless and guileless innocent and uncontaminated children of God without blemish (faultless unrebukable) in the midst of a crooked and wicked generation [spiritually perverted and perverse] among whom you are seen as bright lights (stars or beacons shining out clearly) in the [dark] world
Philippians,2,16,Holding out [to it] and offering [to all men] the Word of Life so that in the day of Christ I may have something of which exultantly to rejoice and glory in that I did not run my race in vain or spend my labor to no purpose.
Philippians,2,17,Even if [my lifeblood] must be poured out as a libation on the sacrificial offering of your faith [to God] still I am glad [to do it] and congratulate you all on [your share in] it.
Philippians,2,18,And you also in like manner be glad and congratulate me on [my share in] it.
Philippians,2,19,But I hope and trust in the Lord Jesus soon to send Timothy to you so that I may also be encouraged and cheered by learning news of you.
Philippians,2,20,For I have no one like him [no one of so kindred a spirit] who will be so genuinely interested in your welfare and devoted to your interests.
Philippians,2,21,For the others all seek [to advance] their own interests not those of Jesus Christ (the Messiah).
Philippians,2,22,But Timothy's tested worth you know how as a son with his father he has toiled with me zealously in [serving and helping to advance] the good news (the Gospel).
Philippians,2,23,I hope therefore to send him promptly just as soon as I know how my case is going to turn out.
Philippians,2,24,But [really] I am confident and fully trusting in the Lord that shortly I myself shall come to you also.
Philippians,2,25,However I thought it necessary to send Epaphroditus [back] to you. [He has been] my brother and companion in labor and my fellow soldier as well as [having come as] your special messenger (apostle) and minister to my need.
Philippians,2,26,For he has been [homesick] longing for you all and has been distressed because you had heard that he was ill.
Philippians,2,27,He certainly was ill [too] near to death. But God had compassion on him and not only on him but also on me lest I should have sorrow [over him] coming upon sorrow.
Philippians,2,28,So I have sent him the more willingly and eagerly that you may be gladdened at seeing him again and that I may be the less disquieted.
Philippians,2,29,Welcome him [home] then in the Lord with all joy and honor and highly appreciate men like him
Philippians,2,30,For it was through working for Christ that he came so near death risking his [very] life to complete the deficiencies in your service to me [which distance prevented you yourselves from rendering].
Philippians,3,1,FOR THE rest my brethren delight yourselves in the Lord and continue to rejoice that you are in Him. To keep writing to you [over and over] of the same things is not irksome to me and it is [a precaution] for your safety.
Philippians,3,2,Look out for those dogs [Judaizers legalists] look out for those mischief-makers look out for those who mutilate the flesh.
Philippians,3,3,For we [Christians] are the true circumcision who worship God in spirit and by the Spirit of God and exult and glory and pride ourselves in Jesus Christ and put no confidence or dependence [on what we are] in the flesh and on outward privileges and physical advantages and external appearances--
Philippians,3,4,Though for myself I have [at least grounds] to rely on the flesh. If any other man considers that he has or seems to have reason to rely on the flesh and his physical and outward advantages I have still more!
Philippians,3,5,Circumcised when I was eight days old of the race of Israel of the tribe of Benjamin a Hebrew [and the son] of Hebrews; as to the observance of the Law I was of [the party of] the Pharisees
Philippians,3,6,As to my zeal I was a persecutor of the church and by the Law's standard of righteousness (supposed justice uprightness and right standing with God) I was proven to be blameless and no fault was found with me.
Philippians,3,7,But whatever former things I had that might have been gains to me I have come to consider as [ one combined] loss for Christ's sake.
Philippians,3,8,Yes furthermore I count everything as loss compared to the possession of the priceless privilege (the overwhelming preciousness the surpassing worth and supreme advantage) of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord and of progressively becoming more deeply and intimately acquainted with Him [of perceiving and recognizing and understanding Him more fully and clearly]. For His sake I have lost everything and consider it all to be mere rubbish (refuse dregs) in order that I may win (gain) Christ (the Anointed One)
Philippians,3,9,And that I may [actually] be found and known as in Him not having any [self-achieved] righteousness that can be called my own based on my obedience to the Law's demands (ritualistic uprightness and supposed right standing with God thus acquired) but possessing that [genuine righteousness] which comes through faith in Christ (the Anointed One) the [truly] right standing with God which comes from God by [saving] faith.
Philippians,3,10,[For my determined purpose is] that I may know Him [that I may progressively become more deeply and intimately acquainted with Him perceiving and recognizing and understanding the wonders of His Person more strongly and more clearly] and that I may in that same way come to know the power outflowing from His resurrection [ which it exerts over believers] and that I may so share His sufferings as to be continually transformed [in spirit into His likeness even] to His death [in the hope]
Philippians,3,11,That if possible I may attain to the [ spiritual and moral] resurrection [that lifts me] out from among the dead [even while in the body].
Philippians,3,12,Not that I have now attained [this ideal] or have already been made perfect but I press on to lay hold of (grasp) and make my own that for which Christ Jesus (the Messiah) has laid hold of me and made me His own.
Philippians,3,13,I do not consider brethren that I have captured and made it my own [yet]; but one thing I do [it is my one aspiration]: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead
Philippians,3,14,I press on toward the goal to win the [supreme and heavenly] prize to which God in Christ Jesus is calling us upward.
Philippians,3,15,So let those [of us] who are spiritually mature and full-grown have this mind and hold these convictions; and if in any respect you have a different attitude of mind God will make that clear to you also.
Philippians,3,16,Only let us hold true to what we have already attained and walk and order our lives by that.
Philippians,3,17,Brethren together follow my example and observe those who live after the pattern we have set for you.
Philippians,3,18,For there are many of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears who walk (live) as enemies of the cross of Christ (the Anointed One).
Philippians,3,19,They are doomed and their fate is eternal misery (perdition); their god is their stomach (their appetites their sensuality) and they glory in their shame siding with earthly things and being of their party.
Philippians,3,20,But we are citizens of the state (commonwealth homeland) which is in heaven and from it also we earnestly and patiently await [the coming of] the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) [as] Savior
Philippians,3,21,Who will transform and fashion anew the body of our humiliation to conform to and be like the body of His glory and majesty by exerting that power which enables Him even to subject everything to Himself.
Philippians,4,1,THEREFORE MY brethren whom I love and yearn to see my delight and crown (wreath of victory) thus stand firm in the Lord my beloved.
Philippians,4,2,I entreat and advise Euodia and I entreat and advise Syntyche to agree and to work in harmony in the Lord.
Philippians,4,3,And I exhort you too [my] genuine yokefellow help these [two women to keep on cooperating] for they have toiled along with me in [the spreading of] the good news (the Gospel) as have Clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the Book of Life.
Philippians,4,4,Rejoice in the Lord always [delight gladden yourselves in Him]; again I say Rejoice!
Philippians,4,5,Let all men know and perceive and recognize your unselfishness (your considerateness your forbearing spirit). The Lord is near [He is coming soon].
Philippians,4,6,Do not fret or have any anxiety about anything but in every circumstance and in everything by prayer and petition ( definite requests) with thanksgiving continue to make your wants known to God.
Philippians,4,7,And God's peace [shall be yours that tranquil state of a soul assured of its salvation through Christ and so fearing nothing from God and being content with its earthly lot of whatever sort that is that peace] which transcends all understanding shall garrison and mount guard over your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.
Philippians,4,8,For the rest brethren whatever is true whatever is worthy of reverence and is honorable and seemly whatever is just whatever is pure whatever is lovely and lovable whatever is kind and winsome and gracious if there is any virtue and excellence if there is anything worthy of praise think on and weigh and take account of these things [fix your minds on them].
Philippians,4,9,Practice what you have learned and received and heard and seen in me and model your way of living on it and the God of peace (of untroubled undisturbed well-being) will be with you.
Philippians,4,10,I was made very happy in the Lord that now you have revived your interest in my welfare after so long a time; you were indeed thinking of me but you had no opportunity to show it.
Philippians,4,11,Not that I am implying that I was in any personal want for I have learned how to be content (satisfied to the point where I am not disturbed or disquieted) in whatever state I am.
Philippians,4,12,I know how to be abased and live humbly in straitened circumstances and I know also how to enjoy plenty and live in abundance. I have learned in any and all circumstances the secret of facing every situation whether well-fed or going hungry having a sufficiency and enough to spare or going without and being in want.
Philippians,4,13,I have strength for all things in Christ Who empowers me [I am ready for anything and equal to anything through Him Who infuses inner strength into me; I am self-sufficient in Christ's sufficiency].
Philippians,4,14,But it was right and commendable and noble of you to contribute for my needs and to share my difficulties with me.
Philippians,4,15,And you Philippians yourselves well know that in the early days of the Gospel ministry when I left Macedonia no church (assembly) entered into partnership with me and opened up [a debit and credit] account in giving and receiving except you only.
Philippians,4,16,For even in Thessalonica you sent [me contributions] for my needs not only once but a second time.
Philippians,4,17,Not that I seek or am eager for [your] gift but I do seek and am eager for the fruit which increases to your credit [the harvest of blessing that is accumulating to your account].
Philippians,4,18,But I have [your full payment] and more; I have everything I need and am amply supplied now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent me. [They are the] fragrant odor of an offering and sacrifice which God welcomes and in which He delights.
Philippians,4,19,And my God will liberally supply ( fill to the full) your every need according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
Philippians,4,20,To our God and Father be glory forever and ever (through the endless eternities of the eternities). Amen (so be it).
Philippians,4,21,Remember me to every saint (every born-again believer) in Christ Jesus. The brethren (my associates) who are with me greet you.
Philippians,4,22,All the saints (God's consecrated ones here) wish to be remembered to you especially those of Caesar's household.
Philippians,4,23,The grace (spiritual favor and blessing) of the Lord Jesus Christ (the Anointed One) be with your spirit. Amen (so be it).
Colossians,1,1,PAUL AN apostle (special messenger) of Christ Jesus (the Messiah) by the will of God and Timothy [our] brother
Colossians,1,2,To the saints (the consecrated people of God) and believing and faithful brethren in Christ who are at Colossae: Grace (spiritual favor and blessing) to you and [heart] peace from God our Father.
Colossians,1,3,We continually give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) as we are praying for you
Colossians,1,4,For we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus [ the leaning of your entire human personality on Him in absolute trust and confidence in His power wisdom and goodness] and of the love which you [have and show] for all the saints (God's consecrated ones)
Colossians,1,5,Because of the hope [of experiencing what is] laid up ( reserved and waiting) for you in heaven. Of this [hope] you heard in the past in the message of the truth of the Gospel
Colossians,1,6,Which has come to you. Indeed in the whole world [that Gospel] is bearing fruit and still is growing [by its own inherent power] even as it has done among yourselves ever since the day you first heard and came to know and understand the grace of God in truth. [You came to know the grace or undeserved favor of God in reality deeply and clearly and thoroughly becoming accurately and intimately acquainted with it.]
Colossians,1,7,You so learned it from Epaphras our beloved fellow servant. He is a faithful minister of Christ in our stead and as our representative and yours.
Colossians,1,8,Also he has informed us of your love in the [Holy] Spirit.
Colossians,1,9,For this reason we also from the day we heard of it have not ceased to pray and make [ special] request for you [asking] that you may be filled with the full (deep and clear) knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom [ in comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of God] and in understanding and discernment of spiritual things--
Colossians,1,10,That you may walk (live and conduct yourselves) in a manner worthy of the Lord fully pleasing to Him and desiring to please Him in all things bearing fruit in every good work and steadily growing and increasing in and by the knowledge of God [with fuller deeper and clearer insight acquaintance and recognition].
Colossians,1,11,[We pray] that you may be invigorated and strengthened with all power according to the might of His glory [to exercise] every kind of endurance and patience (perseverance and forbearance) with joy
Colossians,1,12,Giving thanks to the Father Who has qualified and made us fit to share the portion which is the inheritance of the saints (God's holy people) in the Light.
Colossians,1,13,[The Father] has delivered and drawn us to Himself out of the control and the dominion of darkness and has transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love
Colossians,1,14,In Whom we have our redemption through His blood [which means] the forgiveness of our sins.
Colossians,1,15,[Now] He is the exact likeness of the unseen God [the visible representation of the invisible]; He is the Firstborn of all creation.
Colossians,1,16,For it was in Him that all things were created in heaven and on earth things seen and things unseen whether thrones dominions rulers or authorities; all things were created and exist through Him [by His service intervention] and in and for Him.
Colossians,1,17,And He Himself existed before all things and in Him all things consist (cohere are held together).
Colossians,1,18,He also is the Head of [His] body the church; seeing He is the Beginning the Firstborn from among the dead so that He alone in everything and in every respect might occupy the chief place [stand first and be preeminent].
Colossians,1,19,For it has pleased [the Father] that all the divine fullness (the sum total of the divine perfection powers and attributes) should dwell in Him permanently.
Colossians,1,20,And God purposed that through ( by the service the intervention of) Him [the Son] all things should be completely reconciled back to Himself whether on earth or in heaven as through Him [the Father] made peace by means of the blood of His cross.
Colossians,1,21,And although you at one time were estranged and alienated from Him and were of hostile attitude of mind in your wicked activities
Colossians,1,22,Yet now has [Christ the Messiah] reconciled [you to God] in the body of His flesh through death in order to present you holy and faultless and irreproachable in His [the Father's] presence.
Colossians,1,23,[And this He will do] provided that you continue to stay with and in the faith [in Christ] well-grounded and settled and steadfast not shifting or moving away from the hope [which rests on and is inspired by] the glad tidings (the Gospel) which you heard and which has been preached [as being designed for and offered without restrictions] to every person under heaven and of which [Gospel] I Paul became a minister.
Colossians,1,24,[Even] now I rejoice in the midst of my sufferings on your behalf. And in my own person I am making up whatever is still lacking and remains to be completed [ on our part] of Christ's afflictions for the sake of His body which is the church.
Colossians,1,25,In it I became a minister in accordance with the divine stewardship which was entrusted to me for you [as its object and for your benefit] to make the Word of God fully known [among you]--
Colossians,1,26,The mystery of which was hidden for ages and generations [ from angels and men] but is now revealed to His holy people (the saints)
Colossians,1,27,To whom God was pleased to make known how great for the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery which is Christ within and among you the Hope of [realizing the] glory.
Colossians,1,28,Him we preach and proclaim warning and admonishing everyone and instructing everyone in all wisdom ( comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of God) that we may present every person mature (full-grown fully initiated complete and perfect) in Christ (the Anointed One).
Colossians,1,29,For this I labor [ unto weariness] striving with all the superhuman energy which He so mightily enkindles and works within me.
Colossians,2,1,FOR I want you to know how great is my solicitude for you [how severe an inward struggle I am engaged in for you] and for those [believers] at Laodicea and for all who [ like yourselves] have never seen my face and known me personally.
Colossians,2,2,[For my concern is] that their hearts may be braced (comforted cheered and encouraged) as they are knit together in love that they may come to have all the abounding wealth and blessings of assured conviction of understanding and that they may become progressively more intimately acquainted with and may know more definitely and accurately and thoroughly that mystic secret of God [which is] Christ (the Anointed One).
Colossians,2,3,In Him all the treasures of [divine] wisdom ( comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of God) and [all the riches of spiritual] knowledge and enlightenment are stored up and lie hidden.
Colossians,2,4,I say this in order that no one may mislead and delude you by plausible and persuasive and attractive arguments and beguiling speech.
Colossians,2,5,For though I am away from you in body yet I am with you in spirit delighted at the sight of your [standing shoulder to shoulder in such] orderly array and the firmness and the solid front and steadfastness of your faith in Christ [that leaning of the entire human personality on Him in absolute trust and confidence in His power wisdom and goodness].
Colossians,2,6,As you have therefore received Christ [even] Jesus the Lord [so] walk (regulate your lives and conduct yourselves) in union with and conformity to Him.
Colossians,2,7,Have the roots [of your being] firmly and deeply planted [in Him fixed and founded in Him] being continually built up in Him becoming increasingly more confirmed and established in the faith just as you were taught and abounding and overflowing in it with thanksgiving.
Colossians,2,8,See to it that no one carries you off as spoil or makes you yourselves captive by his so-called philosophy and intellectualism and vain deceit (idle fancies and plain nonsense) following human tradition (men's ideas of the material rather than the spiritual world) just crude notions following the rudimentary and elemental teachings of the universe and disregarding [the teachings of] Christ (the Messiah).
Colossians,2,9,For in Him the whole fullness of Deity (the Godhead) continues to dwell in bodily form [giving complete expression of the divine nature].
Colossians,2,10,And you are in Him made full and having come to fullness of life [in Christ you too are filled with the Godhead--Father Son and Holy Spirit--and reach full spiritual stature]. And He is the Head of all rule and authority [of every angelic principality and power].
Colossians,2,11,In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands but in a [spiritual] circumcision [performed by] Christ by stripping off the body of the flesh (the whole corrupt carnal nature with its passions and lusts).
Colossians,2,12,[Thus you were circumcised when] you were buried with Him in [your] baptism in which you were also raised with Him [ to a new life] through [your] faith in the working of God [ as displayed] when He raised Him up from the dead.
Colossians,2,13,And you who were dead in trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh (your sensuality your sinful carnal nature) [God] brought to life together with [Christ] having [freely] forgiven us all our transgressions
Colossians,2,14,Having cancelled and blotted out and wiped away the handwriting of the note (bond) with its legal decrees and demands which was in force and stood against us (hostile to us). This [note with its regulations decrees and demands] He set aside and cleared completely out of our way by nailing it to [His] cross.
Colossians,2,15,[God] disarmed the principalities and powers that were ranged against us and made a bold display and public example of them in triumphing over them in Him and in it [the cross].
Colossians,2,16,Therefore let no one sit in judgment on you in matters of food and drink or with regard to a feast day or a New Moon or a Sabbath.
Colossians,2,17,Such [things] are only the shadow of things that are to come and they have only a symbolic value. But the reality (the substance the solid fact of what is foreshadowed the body of it) belongs to Christ.
Colossians,2,18,Let no one defraud you by acting as an umpire and declaring you unworthy and disqualifying you for the prize insisting on self-abasement and worship of angels taking his stand on visions [he claims] he has seen vainly puffed up by his sensuous notions and inflated by his unspiritual thoughts and fleshly conceit
Colossians,2,19,And not holding fast to the Head from Whom the entire body supplied and knit together by means of its joints and ligaments grows with a growth that is from God.
Colossians,2,20,If then you have died with Christ to material ways of looking at things and have escaped from the world's crude and elemental notions and teachings of externalism why do you live as if you still belong to the world? [Why do you submit to rules and regulations?--such as]
Colossians,2,21,Do not handle [this] Do not taste [that] Do not even touch [them]
Colossians,2,22,Referring to things all of which perish with being used. To do this is to follow human precepts and doctrines.
Colossians,2,23,Such [practices] have indeed the outward appearance [that popularly passes] for wisdom in promoting self-imposed rigor of devotion and delight in self-humiliation and severity of discipline of the body but they are of no value in checking the indulgence of the flesh (the lower nature). [Instead they do not honor God but serve only to indulge the flesh.]
Colossians,3,1,IF THEN you have been raised with Christ [to a new life thus sharing His resurrection from the dead] aim at and seek the [rich eternal treasures] that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
Colossians,3,2,And set your minds and keep them set on what is above (the higher things) not on the things that are on the earth.
Colossians,3,3,For [as far as this world is concerned] you have died and your [new real] life is hidden with Christ in God.
Colossians,3,4,When Christ Who is our life appears then you also will appear with Him in [the splendor of His] glory.
Colossians,3,5,So kill (deaden deprive of power) the evil desire lurking in your members [those animal impulses and all that is earthly in you that is employed in sin]: sexual vice impurity sensual appetites unholy desires and all greed and covetousness for that is idolatry (the deifying of self and other created things instead of God).
Colossians,3,6,It is on account of these [very sins] that the [holy] anger of God is ever coming upon the sons of disobedience (those who are obstinately opposed to the divine will)
Colossians,3,7,Among whom you also once walked when you were living in and addicted to [such practices].
Colossians,3,8,But now put away and rid yourselves [completely] of all these things: anger rage bad feeling toward others curses and slander and foulmouthed abuse and shameful utterances from your lips!
Colossians,3,9,Do not lie to one another for you have stripped off the old (unregenerate) self with its evil practices
Colossians,3,10,And have clothed yourselves with the new [spiritual self] which is [ever in the process of being] renewed and remolded into [fuller and more perfect knowledge upon] knowledge after the image (the likeness) of Him Who created it.
Colossians,3,11,[In this new creation all distinctions vanish.] There is no room for and there can be neither Greek nor Jew circumcised nor uncircumcised [nor difference between nations whether alien] barbarians or Scythians [ who are the most savage of all] nor slave or free man; but Christ is all and in all [ everything and everywhere to all men without distinction of person].
Colossians,3,12,Clothe yourselves therefore as God's own chosen ones (His own picked representatives) [who are] purified and holy and well-beloved [by God Himself by putting on behavior marked by] tenderhearted pity and mercy kind feeling a lowly opinion of yourselves gentle ways [and] patience [which is tireless and long-suffering and has the power to endure whatever comes with good temper].
Colossians,3,13,Be gentle and forbearing with one another and if one has a difference (a grievance or complaint) against another readily pardoning each other; even as the Lord has [freely] forgiven you so must you also [forgive].
Colossians,3,14,And above all these [put on] love and enfold yourselves with the bond of perfectness [which binds everything together completely in ideal harmony].
Colossians,3,15,And let the peace (soul harmony which comes) from Christ rule (act as umpire continually) in your hearts [deciding and settling with finality all questions that arise in your minds in that peaceful state] to which as [members of Christ's] one body you were also called [to live]. And be thankful (appreciative) [giving praise to God always].
Colossians,3,16,Let the word [spoken by] Christ (the Messiah) have its home [in your hearts and minds] and dwell in you in [all its] richness as you teach and admonish and train one another in all insight and intelligence and wisdom [in spiritual things and as you sing] psalms and hymns and spiritual songs making melody to God with [His] grace in your hearts.
Colossians,3,17,And whatever you do [no matter what it is] in word or deed do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus and in [dependence upon] His Person giving praise to God the Father through Him.
Colossians,3,18,Wives be subject to your husbands [subordinate and adapt yourselves to them] as is right and fitting and your proper duty in the Lord.
Colossians,3,19,Husbands love your wives [be affectionate and sympathetic with them] and do not be harsh or bitter or resentful toward them.
Colossians,3,20,Children obey your parents in everything for this is pleasing to the Lord.
Colossians,3,21,Fathers do not provoke or irritate or fret your children [do not be hard on them or harass them] lest they become discouraged and sullen and morose and feel inferior and frustrated. [Do not break their spirit.]
Colossians,3,22,Servants obey in everything those who are your earthly masters not only when their eyes are on you as pleasers of men but in simplicity of purpose [with all your heart] because of your reverence for the Lord and as a sincere expression of your devotion to Him.
Colossians,3,23,Whatever may be your task work at it heartily (from the soul) as [something done] for the Lord and not for men
Colossians,3,24,Knowing [with all certainty] that it is from the Lord [and not from men] that you will receive the inheritance which is your [real] reward. [The One Whom] you are actually serving [is] the Lord Christ (the Messiah).
Colossians,3,25,For he who deals wrongfully will [reap the fruit of his folly and] be punished for his wrongdoing. And [with God] there is no partiality [no matter what a person's position may be whether he is the slave or the master].
Colossians,4,1,MASTERS [on your part] deal with your slaves justly and fairly knowing that also you have a Master in heaven.
Colossians,4,2,Be earnest and unwearied and steadfast in your prayer [life] being [both] alert and intent in [your praying] with thanksgiving.
Colossians,4,3,And at the same time pray for us also that God may open a door to us for the Word (the Gospel) to proclaim the mystery concerning Christ (the Messiah) on account of which I am in prison;
Colossians,4,4,That I may proclaim it fully and make it clear [speak boldly and unfold that mystery] as is my duty.
Colossians,4,5,Behave yourselves wisely [living prudently and with discretion] in your relations with those of the outside world (the non-Christians) making the very most of the time and seizing (buying up) the opportunity.
Colossians,4,6,Let your speech at all times be gracious (pleasant and winsome) seasoned [as it were] with salt [so that you may never be at a loss] to know how you ought to answer anyone [who puts a question to you].
Colossians,4,7,Tychicus will give you full information about my affairs; [he is] a much-loved brother and faithful ministering assistant and fellow servant [with us] in the Lord.
Colossians,4,8,I have sent him to you for this very purpose that you may know how we are faring and that he may comfort and cheer and encourage your hearts.
Colossians,4,9,And with [him is] Onesimus [our] faithful and beloved brother who is [one] of yourselves. They will let you know everything that has taken place here [in Rome].
Colossians,4,10,Aristarchus my fellow prisoner wishes to be remembered to you as does Mark the relative of Barnabas. You received instructions concerning him; if he comes to you give him a [ hearty] welcome.
Colossians,4,11,And [greetings also from] Jesus who is called Justus. These [Hebrew Christians] alone of the circumcision are among my fellow workers for [the extension of] God's kingdom and they have proved a relief and a comfort to me.
Colossians,4,12,Epaphras who is one of yourselves a servant of Christ Jesus sends you greetings. [He is] always striving for you earnestly in his prayers [pleading] that you may [as persons of ripe character and clear conviction] stand firm and mature [in spiritual growth] convinced and fully assured in everything willed by God.
Colossians,4,13,For I bear him testimony that he has labored hard in your behalf and for [the believers] in Laodicea and those in Hierapolis.
Colossians,4,14,Luke the beloved physician and Demas salute you.
Colossians,4,15,Give my greetings to the brethren at Laodicea and to Nympha and the assembly (the church) which meets in her house.
Colossians,4,16,And when this epistle has been read before you [see] that it is read also in the assembly (the church) of the Laodiceans and also [see] that you yourselves in turn read the [letter that comes to you] from Laodicea.
Colossians,4,17,And say to Archippus See that you discharge carefully [the duties of] the ministry and fulfill the stewardship which you have received in the Lord.
Colossians,4,18,I Paul [add this final] greeting writing with my own hand. Remember I am still in prison and in chains. May grace (God's unmerited favor and blessing) be with you! Amen (so be it).
1 Thessalonians,1,1,PAUL SILVANUS (Silas) and Timothy to the assembly (church) of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah): Grace (spiritual blessing and divine favor) to you and [heart] peace.
1 Thessalonians,1,2,We are ever giving thanks to God for all of you continually mentioning [you when engaged] in our prayers
1 Thessalonians,1,3,Recalling unceasingly before our God and Father your work energized by faith and service motivated by love and unwavering hope in [the return of] our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah). [I Thess. 1:10.]
1 Thessalonians,1,4,[O] brethren beloved by God we recognize and know that He has selected (chosen) you;
1 Thessalonians,1,5,For our [preaching of the] glad tidings (the Gospel) came to you not only in word but also in [its own inherent] power and in the Holy Spirit and with great conviction and absolute certainty [on our part]. You know what kind of men we proved [ourselves] to be among you for your good.
1 Thessalonians,1,6,And you [set yourselves to] become imitators of us and [through us] of the Lord Himself for you welcomed our message in [spite of] much persecution with joy [inspired] by the Holy Spirit;
1 Thessalonians,1,7,So that you [thus] became a pattern to all the believers (those who adhere to trust in and rely on Christ Jesus) in Macedonia and Achaia (most of Greece).
1 Thessalonians,1,8,For not only has the Word concerning and from the Lord resounded forth from you unmistakably in Macedonia and Achaia but everywhere the report has gone forth of your faith in God [of your leaning of your whole personality on Him in complete trust and confidence in His power wisdom and goodness]. So we [find that we] never need to tell people anything [further about it].
1 Thessalonians,1,9,For they themselves volunteer testimony concerning us telling what an entrance we had among you and how you turned to God from [your] idols to serve a God Who is alive and true and genuine
1 Thessalonians,1,10,And [how you] look forward to and await the coming of His Son from heaven Whom He raised from the dead--Jesus Who personally rescues and delivers us out of and from the wrath [bringing punishment] which is coming [upon the impenitent] and draws us to Himself [ investing us with all the privileges and rewards of the new life in Christ the Messiah].
1 Thessalonians,2,1,FOR YOU yourselves know brethren that our coming among you was not useless and fruitless.
1 Thessalonians,2,2,But though we had already suffered and been outrageously treated at Philippi as you know yet in [the strength of] our God we summoned courage to proclaim to you unfalteringly the good news (the Gospel) with earnest contention and much conflict and great opposition.
1 Thessalonians,2,3,For our appeal [in preaching] does not [originate] from delusion or error or impure purpose or motive nor in fraud or deceit.
1 Thessalonians,2,4,But just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the glad tidings (the Gospel) so we speak not to please men but to please God Who tests our hearts [ expecting them to be approved].
1 Thessalonians,2,5,For as you well know we never resorted either to words of flattery or to any cloak to conceal greedy motives or pretexts for gain [as] God is our witness.
1 Thessalonians,2,6,Nor did we seek to extract praise and honor and glory from men either from you or from anyone else though we might have asserted our authority [stood on our dignity and claimed honor] as apostles (special missionaries) of Christ (the Messiah).
1 Thessalonians,2,7,But we behaved gently when we were among you like a devoted mother nursing and cherishing her own children.
1 Thessalonians,2,8,So being thus tenderly and affectionately desirous of you we continued to share with you not only God's good news (the Gospel) but also our own lives as well for you had become so very dear to us.
1 Thessalonians,2,9,For you recall our hard toil and struggles brethren. We worked night and day [and plied our trade] in order not to be a burden to any of you [for our support] while we proclaimed the glad tidings (the Gospel) of God to you.
1 Thessalonians,2,10,You are witnesses [yes] and God [also] how unworldly and upright and blameless was our behavior toward you believers [who adhered to and trusted in and relied on our Lord Jesus Christ].
1 Thessalonians,2,11,For you know how as a father [dealing with] his children we used to exhort each of you personally stimulating and encouraging and charging you
1 Thessalonians,2,12,To live lives worthy of God Who calls you into His own kingdom and the glorious blessedness [ into which true believers will enter after Christ's return].
1 Thessalonians,2,13,And we also [especially] thank God continually for this that when you received the message of God [which you heard] from us you welcomed it not as the word of [mere] men but as it truly is the Word of God which is effectually at work in you who believe [ exercising its superhuman power in those who adhere to and trust in and rely on it].
1 Thessalonians,2,14,For you brethren became imitators of the assemblies (churches) of God in Christ Jesus which are in Judea for you too have suffered the same kind of treatment from your own fellow countrymen as they did [who were persecuted at the hands] of the Jews
1 Thessalonians,2,15,Who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets and harassed and drove us out and continue to make themselves hateful and offensive to God and to show themselves foes of all men
1 Thessalonians,2,16,Forbidding and hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles (the nations) that they may be saved. So as always they fill up [to the brim the measure of] their sins. But God's wrath has come upon them at last [completely and forever]!
1 Thessalonians,2,17,But since we were bereft of you brethren for a little while in person [of course] not in heart we endeavored the more eagerly and with great longing to see you face to face
1 Thessalonians,2,18,Because it was our will to come to you. [I mean that] I Paul again and again [wanted to come] but Satan hindered and impeded us.
1 Thessalonians,2,19,For what is our hope or happiness or our victor's wreath of exultant triumph when we stand in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming? Is it not you?
1 Thessalonians,2,20,For you are [indeed] our glory and our joy!
1 Thessalonians,3,1,THEREFORE WHEN [the suspense of separation and our yearning for some personal communication from you] became intolerable we consented to being left behind alone at Athens.
1 Thessalonians,3,2,And we sent Timothy our brother and God's servant in [spreading] the good news (the Gospel) of Christ to strengthen and establish and to exhort and comfort and encourage you in your faith
1 Thessalonians,3,3,That no one [of you] should be disturbed and beguiled and led astray by these afflictions and difficulties [to which I have referred]. For you yourselves know that this is [unavoidable in our position and must be recognized as] our appointed lot.
1 Thessalonians,3,4,For even when we were with you [you know] we warned you plainly beforehand that we were to be pressed with difficulties and made to suffer affliction just as to your own knowledge it has [since] happened.
1 Thessalonians,3,5,That is the reason that when I could bear [the suspense] no longer I sent that I might learn [how you were standing the strain and the endurance of] your faith [for I was fearful] lest somehow the tempter had tempted you and our toil [among you should prove to] be fruitless and to no purpose.
1 Thessalonians,3,6,But now that Timothy has just come back to us from [his visit to] you and has brought us the good news of [the steadfastness of] your faith and [the warmth of your] love and [reported] how kindly you cherish a constant and affectionate remembrance of us [and that you are] longing to see us as we [are to see] you
1 Thessalonians,3,7,Brethren for this reason in [spite of all] our stress and crushing difficulties we have been filled with comfort and cheer about you [because of] your faith ( the leaning of your whole personality on God in complete trust and confidence).
1 Thessalonians,3,8,Because now we [really] live if you stand [firm] in the Lord.
1 Thessalonians,3,9,For what [adequate] thanksgiving can we render to God for you for all the gladness and delight which we enjoy for your sakes before our God?
1 Thessalonians,3,10,[And we] continue to pray especially and with most intense earnestness night and day that we may see you face to face and mend and make good whatever may be imperfect and lacking in your faith.
1 Thessalonians,3,11,Now may our God and Father Himself and our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) guide our steps to you.
1 Thessalonians,3,12,And may the Lord make you to increase and excel and overflow in love for one another and for all people just as we also do for you
1 Thessalonians,3,13,So that He may strengthen and confirm and establish your hearts faultlessly pure and unblamable in holiness in the sight of our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) with all His saints (the holy and glorified people of God)! Amen (so be it)!
1 Thessalonians,4,1,FURTHERMORE BRETHREN we beg and admonish you in [virtue of our union with] the Lord Jesus that [you follow the instructions which] you learned from us about how you ought to walk so as to please and gratify God as indeed you are doing [and] that you do so even more and more abundantly [attaining yet greater perfection in living this life].
1 Thessalonians,4,2,For you know what charges and precepts we gave you [ on the authority and by the inspiration of] the Lord Jesus.
1 Thessalonians,4,3,For this is the will of God that you should be consecrated (separated and set apart for pure and holy living): that you should abstain and shrink from all sexual vice
1 Thessalonians,4,4,That each one of you should know how to possess (control manage) his own body in consecration (purity separated from things profane) and honor
1 Thessalonians,4,5,Not [to be used] in the passion of lust like the heathen who are ignorant of the true God and have no knowledge of His will
1 Thessalonians,4,6,That no man transgress and overreach his brother and defraud him in this matter or defraud his brother in business. For the Lord is an avenger in all these things as we have already warned you solemnly and told you plainly.
1 Thessalonians,4,7,For God has not called us to impurity but to consecration [to dedicate ourselves to the most thorough purity].
1 Thessalonians,4,8,Therefore whoever disregards (sets aside and rejects this) disregards not man but God Whose [very] Spirit [Whom] He gives to you is holy (chaste pure).
1 Thessalonians,4,9,But concerning brotherly love [for all other Christians] you have no need to have anyone write you for you yourselves have been [personally] taught by God to love one another.
1 Thessalonians,4,10,And indeed you already are [extending and displaying your love] to all the brethren throughout Macedonia. But we beseech and earnestly exhort you brethren that you excel [in this matter] more and more
1 Thessalonians,4,11,To make it your ambition and definitely endeavor to live quietly and peacefully to mind your own affairs and to work with your hands as we charged you
1 Thessalonians,4,12,So that you may bear yourselves becomingly and be correct and honorable and command the respect of the outside world being dependent on nobody [self-supporting] and having need of nothing.
1 Thessalonians,4,13,Now also we would not have you ignorant brethren about those who fall asleep [ in death] that you may not grieve [for them] as the rest do who have no hope [beyond the grave].
1 Thessalonians,4,14,For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so God will also bring with Him through Jesus those who have fallen asleep [ in death].
1 Thessalonians,4,15,For this we declare to you by the Lord's [own] word that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall in no way precede [into His presence] or have any advantage at all over those who have previously fallen asleep [in Him in death].
1 Thessalonians,4,16,For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a loud cry of summons with the shout of an archangel and with the blast of the trumpet of God. And those who have departed this life in Christ will rise first.
1 Thessalonians,4,17,Then we the living ones who remain [on the earth] shall simultaneously be caught up along with [the resurrected dead] in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so always (through the eternity of the eternities) we shall be with the Lord!
1 Thessalonians,4,18,Therefore comfort and encourage one another with these words.
1 Thessalonians,5,1,BUT AS to the suitable times and the precise seasons and dates brethren you have no necessity for anything being written to you.
1 Thessalonians,5,2,For you yourselves know perfectly well that the day of the [return of the] Lord will come [as unexpectedly and suddenly] as a thief in the night.
1 Thessalonians,5,3,When people are saying All is well and secure and There is peace and safety then in a moment unforeseen destruction (ruin and death) will come upon them as suddenly as labor pains come upon a woman with child; and they shall by no means escape for there will be no escape.
1 Thessalonians,5,4,But you are not in [given up to the power of] darkness brethren for that day to overtake you by surprise like a thief.
1 Thessalonians,5,5,For you are all sons of light and sons of the day; we do not belong either to the night or to darkness.
1 Thessalonians,5,6,Accordingly then let us not sleep as the rest do but let us keep wide awake (alert watchful cautious and on our guard) and let us be sober (calm collected and circumspect).
1 Thessalonians,5,7,For those who sleep sleep at night and those who are drunk get drunk at night.
1 Thessalonians,5,8,But we belong to the day; therefore let us be sober and put on the breastplate (corslet) of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation.
1 Thessalonians,5,9,For God has not appointed us to [incur His] wrath [He did not select us to condemn us] but [that we might] obtain [His] salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah)
1 Thessalonians,5,10,Who died for us so that whether we are still alive or are dead [at Christ's appearing] we might live together with Him and share His life.
1 Thessalonians,5,11,Therefore encourage (admonish exhort) one another and edify (strengthen and build up) one another just as you are doing.
1 Thessalonians,5,12,Now also we beseech you brethren get to know those who labor among you [recognize them for what they are acknowledge and appreciate and respect them all]--your leaders who are over you in the Lord and those who warn and kindly reprove and exhort you.
1 Thessalonians,5,13,And hold them in very high and most affectionate esteem in [intelligent and sympathetic] appreciation of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.
1 Thessalonians,5,14,And we earnestly beseech you brethren admonish (warn and seriously advise) those who are out of line [the loafers the disorderly and the unruly]; encourage the timid and fainthearted help and give your support to the weak souls [and] be very patient with everybody [always keeping your temper].
1 Thessalonians,5,15,See that none of you repays another with evil for evil but always aim to show kindness and seek to do good to one another and to everybody.
1 Thessalonians,5,16,Be happy [in your faith] and rejoice and be glad-hearted continually (always);
1 Thessalonians,5,17,Be unceasing in prayer [praying perseveringly];
1 Thessalonians,5,18,Thank [God] in everything [no matter what the circumstances may be be thankful and give thanks] for this is the will of God for you [who are] in Christ Jesus [the Revealer and Mediator of that will].
1 Thessalonians,5,19,Do not quench (suppress or subdue) the [Holy] Spirit;
1 Thessalonians,5,20,Do not spurn the gifts and utterances of the prophets [do not depreciate prophetic revelations nor despise inspired instruction or exhortation or warning].
1 Thessalonians,5,21,But test and prove all things [until you can recognize] what is good; [to that] hold fast.
1 Thessalonians,5,22,Abstain from evil [shrink from it and keep aloof from it] in whatever form or whatever kind it may be.
1 Thessalonians,5,23,And may the God of peace Himself sanctify you through and through [separate you from profane things make you pure and wholly consecrated to God]; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved sound and complete [and found] blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah).
1 Thessalonians,5,24,Faithful is He Who is calling you [to Himself] and utterly trustworthy and He will also do it [fulfill His call by hallowing and keeping you].
1 Thessalonians,5,25,Brethren pray for us.
1 Thessalonians,5,26,Greet all the brethren with a sacred kiss.
1 Thessalonians,5,27,I solemnly charge you [in the name of] the Lord to have this letter read before all the brethren.
1 Thessalonians,5,28,The grace (the unmerited favor and blessings) of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) be with you all. Amen (so be it).
2 Thessalonians,1,1,PAUL SILVANUS (Silas) and Timothy to the church (assembly) of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One):
2 Thessalonians,1,2,Grace (unmerited favor) be to you and [heart] peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One).
2 Thessalonians,1,3,We ought and indeed are obligated [as those in debt] to give thanks always to God for you brethren as is fitting because your faith is growing exceedingly and the love of every one of you each toward the others is increasing and abounds.
2 Thessalonians,1,4,And this is a cause of our mentioning you with pride among the churches (assemblies) of God for your steadfastness (your unflinching endurance and patience) and your firm faith in the midst of all the persecutions and crushing distresses and afflictions under which you are holding up.
2 Thessalonians,1,5,This is positive proof of the just and right judgment of God to the end that you may be deemed deserving of His kingdom [a plain token of His fair verdict which designs that you should be made and counted worthy of the kingdom of God] for the sake of which you are also suffering.
2 Thessalonians,1,6,[It is a fair decision] since it is a righteous thing with God to repay with distress and affliction those who distress and afflict you
2 Thessalonians,1,7,And to [ recompense] you who are so distressed and afflicted [by granting you] relief and rest along with us [your fellow sufferers] when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in a flame of fire
2 Thessalonians,1,8,To deal out retribution (chastisement and vengeance) upon those who do not know or perceive or become acquainted with God and [upon those] who ignore and refuse to obey the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Thessalonians,1,9,Such people will pay the penalty and suffer the punishment of everlasting ruin (destruction and perdition) and eternal exclusion and banishment from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power
2 Thessalonians,1,10,When He comes to be glorified in His saints [on that day He will be made more glorious in His consecrated people] and [He will] be marveled at and admired [in His glory reflected] in all who have believed [who have adhered to trusted in and relied on Him] because our witnessing among you was confidently accepted and believed [and confirmed in your lives].
2 Thessalonians,1,11,With this in view we constantly pray for you that our God may deem and count you worthy of [your] calling and [His] every gracious purpose of goodness and with power may complete in [your] every particular work of faith (faith which is that leaning of the whole human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence in His power wisdom and goodness).
2 Thessalonians,1,12,Thus may the name of our Lord Jesus Christ be glorified and become more glorious through and in you and may you [also be glorified] in Him according to the grace (favor and blessing) of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One).
2 Thessalonians,2,1,BUT RELATIVE to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) and our gathering together to [meet] Him we beg you brethren
2 Thessalonians,2,2,Not to allow your minds to be quickly unsettled or disturbed or kept excited or alarmed whether it be by some [pretended] revelation of [the] Spirit or by word or by letter [alleged to be] from us to the effect that the day of the Lord has [already] arrived and is here.
2 Thessalonians,2,3,Let no one deceive or beguile you in any way for that day will not come except the apostasy comes first [unless the predicted great falling away of those who have professed to be Christians has come] and the man of lawlessness (sin) is revealed who is the son of doom (of perdition)
2 Thessalonians,2,4,Who opposes and exalts himself so proudly and insolently against and over all that is called God or that is worshiped [even to his actually] taking his seat in the temple of God proclaiming that he himself is God.
2 Thessalonians,2,5,Do you not recollect that when I was still with you I told you these things?
2 Thessalonians,2,6,And now you know what is restraining him [from being revealed at this time]; it is so that he may be manifested (revealed) in his own [appointed] time.
2 Thessalonians,2,7,For the mystery of lawlessness (that hidden principle of rebellion against constituted authority) is already at work in the world [but it is] restrained only until he who restrains is taken out of the way.
2 Thessalonians,2,8,And then the lawless one (the antichrist) will be revealed and the Lord Jesus will slay him with the breath of His mouth and bring him to an end by His appearing at His coming.
2 Thessalonians,2,9,The coming [of the lawless one the antichrist] is through the activity and working of Satan and will be attended by great power and with all sorts of [pretended] miracles and signs and delusive marvels--[all of them] lying wonders--
2 Thessalonians,2,10,And by unlimited seduction to evil and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing (going to perdition) because they did not welcome the Truth but refused to love it that they might be saved.
2 Thessalonians,2,11,Therefore God sends upon them a misleading influence a working of error and a strong delusion to make them believe what is false
2 Thessalonians,2,12,In order that all may be judged and condemned who did not believe in [who refused to adhere to trust in and rely on] the Truth but [instead] took pleasure in unrighteousness.
2 Thessalonians,2,13,But we brethren beloved by the Lord ought and are obligated [as those who are in debt] to give thanks always to God for you because God chose you from the beginning as His firstfruits (first converts) for salvation through the sanctifying work of the [Holy] Spirit and [your] belief in (adherence to trust in and reliance on) the Truth.
2 Thessalonians,2,14,[It was] to this end that He called you through our Gospel so that you may obtain and share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah).
2 Thessalonians,2,15,So then brethren stand firm and hold fast to the traditions and instructions which you were taught by us whether by our word of mouth or by letter.
2 Thessalonians,2,16,Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father Who loved us and gave us everlasting consolation and encouragement and well-founded hope through [His] grace (unmerited favor)
2 Thessalonians,2,17,Comfort and encourage your hearts and strengthen them [make them steadfast and keep them unswerving] in every good work and word.
2 Thessalonians,3,1,FURTHERMORE BRETHREN do pray for us that the Word of the Lord may speed on (spread rapidly and run its course) and be glorified (extolled) and triumph even as [it has done] with you
2 Thessalonians,3,2,And that we may be delivered from perverse (improper unrighteous) and wicked (actively malicious) men for not everybody has faith and is held by it.
2 Thessalonians,3,3,Yet the Lord is faithful and He will strengthen [you] and set you on a firm foundation and guard you from the evil [one].
2 Thessalonians,3,4,And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you that you are doing and will continue to do the things which we suggest and with which we charge you.
2 Thessalonians,3,5,May the Lord direct your hearts into [realizing and showing] the love of God and into the steadfastness and patience of Christ and in waiting for His return.
2 Thessalonians,3,6,Now we charge you brethren in the name and on the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) that you withdraw and keep away from every brother (fellow believer) who is slack in the performance of duty and is disorderly living as a shirker and not walking in accord with the traditions and instructions that you have received from us.
2 Thessalonians,3,7,For you yourselves know how it is necessary to imitate our example for we were not disorderly or shirking of duty when we were with you [we were not idle].
2 Thessalonians,3,8,Nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it but with toil and struggle we worked night and day that we might not be a burden or impose on any of you [for our support].
2 Thessalonians,3,9,[It was] not because we do not have a right [to such support] but [we wished] to make ourselves an example for you to follow.
2 Thessalonians,3,10,For while we were yet with you we gave you this rule and charge: If anyone will not work neither let him eat.
2 Thessalonians,3,11,Indeed we hear that some among you are disorderly [that they are passing their lives in idleness neglectful of duty] being busy with other people's affairs instead of their own and doing no work.
2 Thessalonians,3,12,Now we charge and exhort such persons [as ministers in Him exhorting those] in the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) that they work in quietness and earn their own food and other necessities.
2 Thessalonians,3,13,And as for you brethren do not become weary or lose heart in doing right [but continue in well-doing without weakening].
2 Thessalonians,3,14,But if anyone [in the church] refuses to obey what we say in this letter take note of that person and do not associate with him so that he may be ashamed.
2 Thessalonians,3,15,Do not regard him as an enemy but simply admonish and warn him as [being still] a brother.
2 Thessalonians,3,16,Now may the Lord of peace Himself grant you His peace (the peace of His kingdom) at all times and in all ways [under all circumstances and conditions whatever comes]. The Lord [be] with you all.
2 Thessalonians,3,17,I Paul write you this final greeting with my own hand. This is the mark and sign [that it is not a forgery] in every letter of mine. It is the way I write [my handwriting and signature].
2 Thessalonians,3,18,The grace (spiritual blessing and favor) of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) be with you all. Amen (so be it).
1 Timothy,1,1,PAUL AN apostle (special messenger) of Christ Jesus by appointment and command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus (the Messiah) our Hope
1 Timothy,1,2,To Timothy my true son in the faith: Grace (spiritual blessing and favor) mercy and [heart] peace [be yours] from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
1 Timothy,1,3,As I urged you when I was on my way to Macedonia stay on where you are at Ephesus in order that you may warn and admonish and charge certain individuals not to teach any different doctrine
1 Timothy,1,4,Nor to give importance to or occupy themselves with legends (fables myths) and endless genealogies which foster and promote useless speculations and questionings rather than acceptance in faith of God's administration and the divine training that is in faith ( in that leaning of the entire human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence)--
1 Timothy,1,5,Whereas the object and purpose of our instruction and charge is love which springs from a pure heart and a good (clear) conscience and sincere (unfeigned) faith.
1 Timothy,1,6,But certain individuals have missed the mark on this very matter [and] have wandered away into vain arguments and discussions and purposeless talk.
1 Timothy,1,7,They are ambitious to be doctors of the Law (teachers of the Mosaic ritual) but they have no understanding either of the words and terms they use or of the subjects about which they make [such] dogmatic assertions.
1 Timothy,1,8,Now we recognize and know that the Law is good if anyone uses it lawfully [for the purpose for which it was designed]
1 Timothy,1,9,Knowing and understanding this: that the Law is not enacted for the righteous (the upright and just who are in right standing with God) but for the lawless and unruly for the ungodly and sinful for the irreverent and profane for those who strike and beat and [even] murder fathers and strike and beat and [even] murder mothers for manslayers
1 Timothy,1,10,[For] impure and immoral persons those who abuse themselves with men kidnapers liars perjurers--and whatever else is opposed to wholesome teaching and sound doctrine
1 Timothy,1,11,As laid down by the glorious Gospel of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted.
1 Timothy,1,12,I give thanks to Him Who has granted me [the needed] strength and made me able [for this] Christ Jesus our Lord because He has judged and counted me faithful and trustworthy appointing me to [this stewardship of] the ministry.
1 Timothy,1,13,Though I formerly blasphemed and persecuted and was shamefully and outrageously and aggressively insulting [to Him] nevertheless I obtained mercy because I had acted out of ignorance in unbelief.
1 Timothy,1,14,And the grace (unmerited favor and blessing) of our Lord [actually] flowed out superabundantly and beyond measure for me accompanied by faith and love that are [to be realized] in Christ Jesus.
1 Timothy,1,15,The saying is sure and true and worthy of full and universal acceptance that Christ Jesus (the Messiah) came into the world to save sinners of whom I am foremost.
1 Timothy,1,16,But I obtained mercy for the reason that in me as the foremost [of sinners] Jesus Christ might show forth and display all His perfect long-suffering and patience for an example to [encourage] those who would thereafter believe on Him for [the gaining of] eternal life.
1 Timothy,1,17,Now to the King of eternity incorruptible and immortal invisible the only God be honor and glory forever and ever (to the ages of ages). Amen (so be it).
1 Timothy,1,18,This charge and admonition I commit in trust to you Timothy my son in accordance with prophetic intimations which I formerly received concerning you so that inspired and aided by them you may wage the good warfare
1 Timothy,1,19,Holding fast to faith ( that leaning of the entire human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence) and having a good (clear) conscience. By rejecting and thrusting from them [their conscience] some individuals have made shipwreck of their faith.
1 Timothy,1,20,Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander whom I have delivered to Satan in order that they may be disciplined [by punishment and learn] not to blaspheme.
1 Timothy,2,1,FIRST OF all then I admonish and urge that petitions prayers intercessions and thanksgivings be offered on behalf of all men
1 Timothy,2,2,For kings and all who are in positions of authority or high responsibility that [outwardly] we may pass a quiet and undisturbed life [and inwardly] a peaceable one in all godliness and reverence and seriousness in every way.
1 Timothy,2,3,For such [praying] is good and right and [it is] pleasing and acceptable to God our Savior
1 Timothy,2,4,Who wishes all men to be saved and [increasingly] to perceive and recognize and discern and know precisely and correctly the [divine] Truth.
1 Timothy,2,5,For there [is only] one God and [only] one Mediator between God and men the Man Christ Jesus
1 Timothy,2,6,Who gave Himself as a ransom for all [people a fact that was] attested to at the right and proper time.
1 Timothy,2,7,And of this matter I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (special messenger)--I am speaking the truth in Christ I do not falsify [when I say this]--a teacher of the Gentiles in [the realm of] faith and truth.
1 Timothy,2,8,I desire therefore that in every place men should pray without anger or quarreling or resentment or doubt [in their minds] lifting up holy hands.
1 Timothy,2,9,Also [I desire] that women should adorn themselves modestly and appropriately and sensibly in seemly apparel not with [elaborate] hair arrangement or gold or pearls or expensive clothing
1 Timothy,2,10,But by doing good deeds (deeds in themselves good and for the good and advantage of those contacted by them) as befits women who profess reverential fear for and devotion to God.
1 Timothy,2,11,Let a woman learn in quietness in entire submissiveness.
1 Timothy,2,12,I allow no woman to teach or to have authority over men; she is to remain in quietness and keep silence [in religious assemblies].
1 Timothy,2,13,For Adam was first formed then Eve;
1 Timothy,2,14,And it was not Adam who was deceived but [the] woman who was deceived and deluded and fell into transgression.
1 Timothy,2,15,Nevertheless [the sentence put upon women of pain in motherhood does not hinder their souls' salvation and] they will be saved [eternally] if they continue in faith and love and holiness with self-control [saved indeed] through the Childbearing or by the birth of the divine Child.
1 Timothy,3,1,THE SAYING is true and irrefutable: If any man [eagerly] seeks the office of bishop (superintendent overseer) he desires an excellent task (work).
1 Timothy,3,2,Now a bishop (superintendent overseer) must give no grounds for accusation but must be above reproach the husband of one wife circumspect and temperate and self-controlled; [he must be] sensible and well behaved and dignified and lead an orderly (disciplined) life; [he must be] hospitable [showing love for and being a friend to the believers especially strangers or foreigners and be] a capable and qualified teacher
1 Timothy,3,3,Not given to wine not combative but gentle and considerate not quarrelsome but forbearing and peaceable and not a lover of money [insatiable for wealth and ready to obtain it by questionable means].
1 Timothy,3,4,He must rule his own household well keeping his children under control with true dignity commanding their respect in every way and keeping them respectful.
1 Timothy,3,5,For if a man does not know how to rule his own household how is he to take care of the church of God?
1 Timothy,3,6,He must not be a new convert or he may [develop a beclouded and stupid state of mind] as the result of pride [be blinded by conceit and] fall into the condemnation that the devil [once] did.
1 Timothy,3,7,Furthermore he must have a good reputation and be well thought of by those outside [the church] lest he become involved in slander and incur reproach and fall into the devil's trap.
1 Timothy,3,8,In like manner the deacons [must be] worthy of respect not shifty and double-talkers but sincere in what they say not given to much wine not greedy for base gain [craving wealth and resorting to ignoble and dishonest methods of getting it].
1 Timothy,3,9,They must possess the mystic secret of the faith [Christian truth as hidden from ungodly men] with a clear conscience.
1 Timothy,3,10,And let them also be tried and investigated and proved first; then if they turn out to be above reproach let them serve [as deacons].
1 Timothy,3,11,[The] women likewise must be worthy of respect and serious not gossipers but temperate and self-controlled [thoroughly] trustworthy in all things.
1 Timothy,3,12,Let deacons be the husbands of but one wife and let them manage [their] children and their own households well.
1 Timothy,3,13,For those who perform well as deacons acquire a good standing for themselves and also gain much confidence and freedom and boldness in the faith which is [founded on and centers] in Christ Jesus.
1 Timothy,3,14,Although I hope to come to you before long I am writing these instructions to you so that
1 Timothy,3,15,If I am detained you may know how people ought to conduct themselves in the household of God which is the church of the living God the pillar and stay (the prop and support) of the Truth.
1 Timothy,3,16,And great and important and weighty we confess is the hidden truth (the mystic secret) of godliness. He [ God] was made visible in human flesh justified and vindicated in the [Holy] Spirit was seen by angels preached among the nations believed on in the world [and] taken up in glory.
1 Timothy,4,1,BUT THE [Holy] Spirit distinctly and expressly declares that in latter times some will turn away from the faith giving attention to deluding and seducing spirits and doctrines that demons teach
1 Timothy,4,2,Through the hypocrisy and pretensions of liars whose consciences are seared (cauterized)
1 Timothy,4,3,Who forbid people to marry and [teach them] to abstain from [certain kinds of] foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and have [an increasingly clear] knowledge of the truth.
1 Timothy,4,4,For everything God has created is good and nothing is to be thrown away or refused if it is received with thanksgiving.
1 Timothy,4,5,For it is hallowed and consecrated by the Word of God and by prayer.
1 Timothy,4,6,If you lay all these instructions before the brethren you will be a worthy steward and a good minister of Christ Jesus ever nourishing your own self on the truths of the faith and of the good [Christian] instruction which you have closely followed.
1 Timothy,4,7,But refuse and avoid irreverent legends (profane and impure and godless fictions mere grandmothers' tales) and silly myths and express your disapproval of them. Train yourself toward godliness (piety) [keeping yourself spiritually fit].
1 Timothy,4,8,For physical training is of some value (useful for a little) but godliness (spiritual training) is useful and of value in everything and in every way for it holds promise for the present life and also for the life which is to come.
1 Timothy,4,9,This saying is reliable and worthy of complete acceptance by everybody.
1 Timothy,4,10,With a view to this we toil and strive [yes and] suffer reproach because we have [fixed our] hope on the living God Who is the Savior (Preserver Maintainer Deliverer) of all men especially of those who believe (trust in rely on and adhere to Him).
1 Timothy,4,11,Continue to command these things and to teach them.
1 Timothy,4,12,Let no one despise or think less of you because of your youth but be an example (pattern) for the believers in speech in conduct in love in faith and in purity.
1 Timothy,4,13,Till I come devote yourself to [public and private] reading to exhortation (preaching and personal appeals) and to teaching and instilling doctrine.
1 Timothy,4,14,Do not neglect the gift which is in you [that special inward endowment] which was directly imparted to you [by the Holy Spirit] by prophetic utterance when the elders laid their hands upon you [at your ordination].
1 Timothy,4,15,Practice and cultivate and meditate upon these duties; throw yourself wholly into them [as your ministry] so that your progress may be evident to everybody.
1 Timothy,4,16,Look well to yourself [to your own personality] and to [your] teaching; persevere in these things [hold to them] for by so doing you will save both yourself and those who hear you.
1 Timothy,5,1,DO NOT sharply censure or rebuke an older man but entreat and plead with him as [you would with] a father. Treat younger men like brothers;
1 Timothy,5,2,[Treat] older women like mothers [and] younger women like sisters in all purity.
1 Timothy,5,3,[Always] treat with great consideration and give aid to those who are truly widowed (solitary and without support).
1 Timothy,5,4,But if a widow has children or grandchildren see to it that these are first made to understand that it is their religious duty [to defray their natural obligation to those] at home and make return to their parents or grandparents [for all their care by contributing to their maintenance] for this is acceptable in the sight of God.
1 Timothy,5,5,Now [a woman] who is a real widow and is left entirely alone and desolate has fixed her hope on God and perseveres in supplications and prayers night and day
1 Timothy,5,6,Whereas she who lives in pleasure and self-gratification [giving herself up to luxury and self-indulgence] is dead even while she [still] lives.
1 Timothy,5,7,Charge [the people] thus so that they may be without reproach and blameless.
1 Timothy,5,8,If anyone fails to provide for his relatives and especially for those of his own family he has disowned the faith [by failing to accompany it with fruits] and is worse than an unbeliever [who performs his obligation in these matters].
1 Timothy,5,9,Let no one be put on the roll of widows [who are to receive church support] who is under sixty years of age or who has been the wife of more than one man;
1 Timothy,5,10,And she must have a reputation for good deeds as one who has brought up children who has practiced hospitality to strangers [of the brotherhood] washed the feet of the saints helped to relieve the distressed [and] devoted herself diligently to doing good in every way.
1 Timothy,5,11,But refuse [to enroll on this list the] younger widows for when they become restive and their natural desires grow strong they withdraw themselves against Christ [and] wish to marry [again].
1 Timothy,5,12,And so they incur condemnation for having set aside and slighted their previous pledge.
1 Timothy,5,13,Moreover as they go about from house to house they learn to be idlers and not only idlers but gossips and busybodies saying what they should not say and talking of things they should not mention.
1 Timothy,5,14,So I would have younger [widows] marry bear children guide the household [and] not give opponents of the faith occasion for slander or reproach.
1 Timothy,5,15,For already some [widows] have turned aside after Satan.
1 Timothy,5,16,If any believing woman or believing man has [relatives or persons in the household who are] widows let him relieve them; let the church not be burdened [with them] so that it may [be free to] assist those who are truly widows (those who are all alone and are dependent).
1 Timothy,5,17,Let the elders who perform the duties of their office well be considered doubly worthy of honor [and of adequate financial support] especially those who labor faithfully in preaching and teaching.
1 Timothy,5,18,For the Scripture says You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the grain and again The laborer is worthy of his hire.
1 Timothy,5,19,Listen to no accusation [presented before a judge] against an elder unless it is confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
1 Timothy,5,20,As for those who are guilty and persist in sin rebuke and admonish them in the presence of all so that the rest may be warned and stand in wholesome awe and fear.
1 Timothy,5,21,I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the chosen angels that you guard and keep [these rules] without personal prejudice or favor doing nothing from partiality.
1 Timothy,5,22,Do not be in a hurry in the laying on of hands [giving the sanction of the church too hastily in reinstating expelled offenders or in ordination in questionable cases] nor share or participate in another man's sins; keep yourself pure.
1 Timothy,5,23,Drink water no longer exclusively but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent illnesses.
1 Timothy,5,24,The sins of some men are conspicuous (openly evident to all eyes) going before them to the judgment [seat] and proclaiming their sentence in advance; but the sins of others appear later [following the offender to the bar of judgment and coming into view there].
1 Timothy,5,25,So also good deeds are evident and conspicuous and even when they are not they cannot remain hidden [indefinitely].
1 Timothy,6,1,LET ALL who are under the yoke as bond servants esteem their own [personal] masters worthy of honor and fullest respect so that the name of God and the teaching [about Him] may not be brought into disrepute and blasphemed.
1 Timothy,6,2,Let those who have believing masters not be disrespectful or scornful [to them] on the grounds that they are brothers [in Christ]; rather they should serve [them all the better] because those who benefit by their kindly service are believers and beloved. Teach and urge these duties.
1 Timothy,6,3,But if anyone teaches otherwise and does not assent to the sound and wholesome messages of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) and the teaching which is in agreement with godliness (piety toward God)
1 Timothy,6,4,He is puffed up with pride and stupefied with conceit [although he is] woefully ignorant. He has a morbid fondness for controversy and disputes and strife about words which result in (produce) envy and jealousy quarrels and dissension abuse and insults and slander and base suspicions
1 Timothy,6,5,And protracted wrangling and wearing discussion and perpetual friction among men who are corrupted in mind and bereft of the truth who imagine that godliness or righteousness is a source of profit [a moneymaking business a means of livelihood]. From such withdraw.
1 Timothy,6,6,[And it is indeed a source of immense profit for] godliness accompanied with contentment (that contentment which is a sense of inward sufficiency) is great and abundant gain.
1 Timothy,6,7,For we brought nothing into the world and obviously we cannot take anything out of the world;
1 Timothy,6,8,But if we have food and clothing with these we shall be content (satisfied).
1 Timothy,6,9,But those who crave to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish (useless godless) and hurtful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction and miserable perishing.
1 Timothy,6,10,For the love of money is a root of all evils; it is through this craving that some have been led astray and have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves through with many acute [mental] pangs.
1 Timothy,6,11,But as for you O man of God flee from all these things; aim at and pursue righteousness (right standing with God and true goodness) godliness (which is the loving fear of God and being Christlike) faith love steadfastness (patience) and gentleness of heart.
1 Timothy,6,12,Fight the good fight of the faith; lay hold of the eternal life to which you were summoned and [for which] you confessed the good confession [of faith] before many witnesses.
1 Timothy,6,13,In the presence of God Who preserves alive all living things and of Christ Jesus Who in His testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good confession I [solemnly] charge you
1 Timothy,6,14,To keep all His precepts unsullied and flawless irreproachable until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Anointed One)
1 Timothy,6,15,Which [appearing] will be shown forth in His own proper time by the blessed only Sovereign (Ruler) the King of kings and the Lord of lords
1 Timothy,6,16,Who alone has immortality [in the sense of exemption from every kind of death] and lives in unapproachable light Whom no man has ever seen or can see. Unto Him be honor and everlasting power and dominion. Amen (so be it).
1 Timothy,6,17,As for the rich in this world charge them not to be proud and arrogant and contemptuous of others nor to set their hopes on uncertain riches but on God Who richly and ceaselessly provides us with everything for [our] enjoyment.
1 Timothy,6,18,[Charge them] to do good to be rich in good works to be liberal and generous of heart ready to share [with others]
1 Timothy,6,19,In this way laying up for themselves [the riches that endure forever as] a good foundation for the future so that they may grasp that which is life indeed.
1 Timothy,6,20,O Timothy guard and keep the deposit entrusted [to you]! Turn away from the irreverent babble and godless chatter with the vain and empty and worldly phrases and the subtleties and the contradictions in what is falsely called knowledge and spiritual illumination.
1 Timothy,6,21,[For] by making such profession some have erred (missed the mark) as regards the faith. Grace (divine favor and blessing) be with you all! Amen (so be it).
2 Timothy,1,1,PAUL AN apostle (special messenger) of Christ Jesus by the will of God according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus
2 Timothy,1,2,To Timothy [my] beloved child: Grace (favor and spiritual blessing) mercy and [heart] peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord!
2 Timothy,1,3,I thank God Whom I worship with a pure conscience in the spirit of my fathers when without ceasing I remember you night and day in my prayers
2 Timothy,1,4,And when as I recall your tears I yearn to see you so that I may be filled with joy.
2 Timothy,1,5,I am calling up memories of your sincere and unqualified faith (the leaning of your entire personality on God in Christ in absolute trust and confidence in His power wisdom and goodness) [a faith] that first lived permanently in [the heart of] your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now I am [fully] persuaded [dwells] in you also.
2 Timothy,1,6,That is why I would remind you to stir up (rekindle the embers of fan the flame of and keep burning) the [gracious] gift of God [the inner fire] that is in you by means of the laying on of my hands [ with those of the elders at your ordination].
2 Timothy,1,7,For God did not give us a spirit of timidity (of cowardice of craven and cringing and fawning fear) but [He has given us a spirit] of power and of love and of calm and well-balanced mind and discipline and self-control.
2 Timothy,1,8,Do not blush or be ashamed then to testify to and for our Lord nor of me a prisoner for His sake but [ with me] take your share of the suffering [to which the preaching] of the Gospel [may expose you and do it] in the power of God.
2 Timothy,1,9,[For it is He] Who delivered and saved us and called us with a calling in itself holy and leading to holiness [to a life of consecration a vocation of holiness]; [He did it] not because of anything of merit that we have done but because of and to further His own purpose and grace (unmerited favor) which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began [eternal ages ago].
2 Timothy,1,10,[It is that purpose and grace] which He now has made known and has fully disclosed and made real [to us] through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus Who annulled death and made it of no effect and brought life and immortality (immunity from eternal death) to light through the Gospel.
2 Timothy,1,11,For [the proclaiming of] this [Gospel] I was appointed a herald (preacher) and an apostle (special messenger) and a teacher of the Gentiles.
2 Timothy,1,12,And this is why I am suffering as I do. Still I am not ashamed for I know (perceive have knowledge of and am acquainted with) Him Whom I have believed (adhered to and trusted in and relied on) and I am [positively] persuaded that He is able to guard and keep that which has been entrusted to me and which I have committed [to Him] until that day.
2 Timothy,1,13,Hold fast and follow the pattern of wholesome and sound teaching which you have heard from me in [all] the faith and love which are [for us] in Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy,1,14,Guard and keep [with the greatest care] the precious and excellently adapted [Truth] which has been entrusted [to you] by the [help of the] Holy Spirit Who makes His home in us.
2 Timothy,1,15,You already know that all who are in Asia turned away and forsook me Phygelus and Hermogenes among them.
2 Timothy,1,16,May the Lord grant [His] mercy to the family of Onesiphorus for he often showed me kindness and ministered to my needs [comforting and reviving and bracing me like fresh air]! He was not ashamed of my chains and imprisonment [for Christ's sake].
2 Timothy,1,17,No rather when he reached Rome he searched diligently and eagerly for me and found me.
2 Timothy,1,18,May the Lord grant to him that he may find mercy from the Lord on that [great] day! And you know how many things he did for me and what a help he was at Ephesus [you know better than I can tell you].
2 Timothy,2,1,SO YOU my son be strong (strengthened inwardly) in the grace (spiritual blessing) that is [to be found only] in Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy,2,2,And the [instructions] which you have heard from me along with many witnesses transmit and entrust [as a deposit] to reliable and faithful men who will be competent and qualified to teach others also.
2 Timothy,2,3,Take [with me] your share of the hardships and suffering [which you are called to endure] as a good (first-class) soldier of Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy,2,4,No soldier when in service gets entangled in the enterprises of [civilian] life; his aim is to satisfy and please the one who enlisted him.
2 Timothy,2,5,And if anyone enters competitive games he is not crowned unless he competes lawfully (fairly according to the rules laid down).
2 Timothy,2,6,[It is] the hard-working farmer [who labors to produce] who must be the first partaker of the fruits.
2 Timothy,2,7,Think over these things I am saying [understand them and grasp their application] for the Lord will grant you full insight and understanding in everything.
2 Timothy,2,8,Constantly keep in mind Jesus Christ (the Messiah) [as] risen from the dead [as the prophesied King] descended from David according to the good news (the Gospel) that I preach.
2 Timothy,2,9,For that [Gospel] I am suffering affliction and even wearing chains like a criminal. But the Word of God is not chained or imprisoned!
2 Timothy,2,10,Therefore I [am ready to] persevere and stand my ground with patience and endure everything for the sake of the elect [God's chosen] so that they too may obtain [the] salvation which is in Christ Jesus with [the reward of] eternal glory.
2 Timothy,2,11,The saying is sure and worthy of confidence: If we have died with Him we shall also live with Him.
2 Timothy,2,12,If we endure we shall also reign with Him. If we deny and disown and reject Him He will also deny and disown and reject us.
2 Timothy,2,13,If we are faithless [do not believe and are untrue to Him] He remains true (faithful to His Word and His righteous character) for He cannot deny Himself.
2 Timothy,2,14,Remind [the people] of these facts and [solemnly] charge them in the presence of the Lord to avoid petty controversy over words which does no good but upsets and undermines the faith of the hearers.
2 Timothy,2,15,Study and be eager and do your utmost to present yourself to God approved (tested by trial) a workman who has no cause to be ashamed correctly analyzing and accurately dividing [rightly handling and skillfully teaching] the Word of Truth.
2 Timothy,2,16,But avoid all empty (vain useless idle) talk for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness.
2 Timothy,2,17,And their teaching [will devour; it] will eat its way like cancer or spread like gangrene. So it is with Hymenaeus and Philetus
2 Timothy,2,18,Who have missed the mark and swerved from the truth by arguing that the resurrection has already taken place. They are undermining the faith of some.
2 Timothy,2,19,But the firm foundation of (laid by) God stands sure and unshaken bearing this seal (inscription): The Lord knows those who are His and Let everyone who names [himself by] the name of the Lord give up all iniquity and stand aloof from it.
2 Timothy,2,20,But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also [utensils] of wood and earthenware and some for honorable and noble [use] and some for menial and ignoble [use].
2 Timothy,2,21,So whoever cleanses himself [from what is ignoble and unclean who separates himself from contact with contaminating and corrupting influences] will [then himself] be a vessel set apart and useful for honorable and noble purposes consecrated and profitable to the Master fit and ready for any good work.
2 Timothy,2,22,Shun youthful lusts and flee from them and aim at and pursue righteousness (all that is virtuous and good right living conformity to the will of God in thought word and deed); [and aim at and pursue] faith love [and] peace (harmony and concord with others) in fellowship with all [Christians] who call upon the Lord out of a pure heart.
2 Timothy,2,23,But refuse (shut your mind against have nothing to do with) trifling (ill-informed unedifying stupid) controversies over ignorant questionings for you know that they foster strife and breed quarrels.
2 Timothy,2,24,And the servant of the Lord must not be quarrelsome (fighting and contending). Instead he must be kindly to everyone and mild-tempered [preserving the bond of peace]; he must be a skilled and suitable teacher patient and forbearing and willing to suffer wrong.
2 Timothy,2,25,He must correct his opponents with courtesy and gentleness in the hope that God may grant that they will repent and come to know the Truth [that they will perceive and recognize and become accurately acquainted with and acknowledge it]
2 Timothy,2,26,And that they may come to their senses [and] escape out of the snare of the devil having been held captive by him [henceforth] to do His [God's] will.
2 Timothy,3,1,BUT UNDERSTAND this that in the last days will come (set in) perilous times of great stress and trouble [hard to deal with and hard to bear].
2 Timothy,3,2,For people will be lovers of self and [utterly] self-centered lovers of money and aroused by an inordinate [greedy] desire for wealth proud and arrogant and contemptuous boasters. They will be abusive (blasphemous scoffing) disobedient to parents ungrateful unholy and profane.
2 Timothy,3,3,[They will be] without natural [human] affection (callous and inhuman) relentless (admitting of no truce or appeasement); [they will be] slanderers (false accusers troublemakers) intemperate and loose in morals and conduct uncontrolled and fierce haters of good.
2 Timothy,3,4,[They will be] treacherous [betrayers] rash [and] inflated with self-conceit. [They will be] lovers of sensual pleasures and vain amusements more than and rather than lovers of God.
2 Timothy,3,5,For [although] they hold a form of piety (true religion) they deny and reject and are strangers to the power of it [their conduct belies the genuineness of their profession]. Avoid [all] such people [turn away from them].
2 Timothy,3,6,For among them are those who worm their way into homes and captivate silly and weak-natured and spiritually dwarfed women loaded down with [the burden of their] sins [and easily] swayed and led away by various evil desires and seductive impulses.
2 Timothy,3,7,[These weak women will listen to anybody who will teach them]; they are forever inquiring and getting information but are never able to arrive at a recognition and knowledge of the Truth.
2 Timothy,3,8,Now just as Jannes and Jambres were hostile to and resisted Moses so these men also are hostile to and oppose the Truth. They have depraved and distorted minds and are reprobate and counterfeit and to be rejected as far as the faith is concerned.
2 Timothy,3,9,But they will not get very far for their rash folly will become obvious to everybody as was that of those [magicians mentioned].
2 Timothy,3,10,Now you have closely observed and diligently followed my teaching conduct purpose in life faith patience love steadfastness
2 Timothy,3,11,Persecutions sufferings--such as occurred to me at Antioch at Iconium and at Lystra persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me.
2 Timothy,3,12,Indeed all who delight in piety and are determined to live a devoted and godly life in Christ Jesus will meet with persecution [will be made to suffer because of their religious stand].
2 Timothy,3,13,But wicked men and imposters will go on from bad to worse deceiving and leading astray others and being deceived and led astray themselves.
2 Timothy,3,14,But as for you continue to hold to the things that you have learned and of which you are convinced knowing from whom you learned [them]
2 Timothy,3,15,And how from your childhood you have had a knowledge of and been acquainted with the sacred Writings which are able to instruct you and give you the understanding for salvation which comes through faith in Christ Jesus [through the leaning of the entire human personality on God in Christ Jesus in absolute trust and confidence in His power wisdom and goodness].
2 Timothy,3,16,Every Scripture is God-breathed (given by His inspiration) and profitable for instruction for reproof and conviction of sin for correction of error and discipline in obedience [and] for training in righteousness (in holy living in conformity to God's will in thought purpose and action)
2 Timothy,3,17,So that the man of God may be complete and proficient well fitted and thoroughly equipped for every good work.
2 Timothy,4,1,I CHARGE [you] in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus Who is to judge the living and the dead and by (in the light of) His coming and His kingdom:
2 Timothy,4,2,Herald and preach the Word! Keep your sense of urgency [stand by be at hand and ready] whether the opportunity seems to be favorable or unfavorable. [Whether it is convenient or inconvenient whether it is welcome or unwelcome you as preacher of the Word are to show people in what way their lives are wrong.] And convince them rebuking and correcting warning and urging and encouraging them being unflagging and inexhaustible in patience and teaching.
2 Timothy,4,3,For the time is coming when [people] will not tolerate (endure) sound and wholesome instruction but having ears itching [for something pleasing and gratifying] they will gather to themselves one teacher after another to a considerable number chosen to satisfy their own liking and to foster the errors they hold
2 Timothy,4,4,And will turn aside from hearing the truth and wander off into myths and man-made fictions.
2 Timothy,4,5,As for you be calm and cool and steady accept and suffer unflinchingly every hardship do the work of an evangelist fully perform all the duties of your ministry.
2 Timothy,4,6,For I am already about to be sacrificed [my life is about to be poured out as a drink offering]; the time of my [spirit's] release [from the body] is at hand and I will soon go free.
2 Timothy,4,7,I have fought the good (worthy honorable and noble) fight I have finished the race I have kept (firmly held) the faith.
2 Timothy,4,8,[As to what remains] henceforth there is laid up for me the [victor's] crown of righteousness [for being right with God and doing right] which the Lord the righteous Judge will award to me and recompense me on that [great] day--and not to me only but also to all those who have loved and yearned for and welcomed His appearing (His return).
2 Timothy,4,9,Make every effort to come to me soon.
2 Timothy,4,10,For Demas has deserted me for love of this present world and has gone to Thessalonica; Crescens [has gone] to Galatia Titus to Dalmatia.
2 Timothy,4,11,Luke alone is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you for he is very helpful to me for the ministry.
2 Timothy,4,12,Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.
2 Timothy,4,13,[When] you come bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus also the books especially the parchments.
2 Timothy,4,14,Alexander the coppersmith did me great wrongs. The Lord will pay him back for his actions.
2 Timothy,4,15,Beware of him yourself for he opposed and resisted our message very strongly and exceedingly.
2 Timothy,4,16,At my first trial no one acted in my defense [as my advocate] or took my part or [even] stood with me but all forsook me. May it not be charged against them!
2 Timothy,4,17,But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me so that through me the [Gospel] message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. So I was delivered out of the jaws of the lion.
2 Timothy,4,18,[And indeed] the Lord will certainly deliver and draw me to Himself from every assault of evil. He will preserve and bring me safe unto His heavenly kingdom. To Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen (so be it).
2 Timothy,4,19,Give my greetings to Prisca and Aquila and to the household of Onesiphorus.
2 Timothy,4,20,Erastus stayed on at Corinth but Trophimus I left ill at Miletus.
2 Timothy,4,21,Do hasten and try your best to come to me before winter. Eubulus wishes to be remembered to you as do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren.
2 Timothy,4,22,The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace (God's favor and blessing) be with you. Amen (so be it).
Titus,1,1,PAUL A bond servant of God and an apostle (a special messenger) of Jesus Christ (the Messiah) to stimulate and promote the faith of God's chosen ones and to lead them on to accurate discernment and recognition of and acquaintance with the Truth which belongs to and harmonizes with and tends to godliness
Titus,1,2,[Resting] in the hope of eternal life [life] which the ever truthful God Who cannot deceive promised before the world or the ages of time began.
Titus,1,3,And [now] in His own appointed time He has made manifest (made known) His Word and revealed it as His message through the preaching entrusted to me by command of God our Savior;
Titus,1,4,To Titus my true child according to a common (general) faith: Grace (favor and spiritual blessing) and [heart] peace from God the Father and the Lord Christ Jesus our Savior.
Titus,1,5,For this reason I left you [behind] in Crete that you might set right what was defective and finish what was left undone and that you might appoint elders and set them over the churches (assemblies) in every city as I directed you.
Titus,1,6,[These elders should be] men who are of unquestionable integrity and are irreproachable the husband of [but] one wife whose children are [well trained and are] believers not open to the accusation of being loose in morals and conduct or unruly and disorderly.
Titus,1,7,For the bishop (an overseer) as God's steward must be blameless not self-willed or arrogant or presumptuous; he must not be quick-tempered or given to drink or pugnacious (brawling violent); he must not be grasping and greedy for filthy lucre (financial gain);
Titus,1,8,But he must be hospitable (loving and a friend to believers especially to strangers and foreigners); [he must be] a lover of goodness [of good people and good things] sober-minded (sensible discreet) upright and fair-minded a devout man and religiously correct temperate and keeping himself in hand.
Titus,1,9,He must hold fast to the sure and trustworthy Word of God as he was taught it so that he may be able both to give stimulating instruction and encouragement in sound (wholesome) doctrine and to refute and convict those who contradict and oppose it [showing the wayward their error].
Titus,1,10,For there are many disorderly and unruly men who are idle (vain empty) and misleading talkers and self-deceivers and deceivers of others. [This is true] especially of those of the circumcision party [who have come over from Judaism].
Titus,1,11,Their mouths must be stopped for they are mentally distressing and subverting whole families by teaching what they ought not to teach for the purpose of getting base advantage and disreputable gain.
Titus,1,12,One of their [very] number a prophet of their own said Cretans are always liars hurtful beasts idle and lazy gluttons.
Titus,1,13,And this account of them is [really] true. Because it is [true] rebuke them sharply [deal sternly even severely with them] so that they may be sound in the faith and free from error
Titus,1,14,[And may show their soundness by] ceasing to give attention to Jewish myths and fables or to rules [laid down] by [mere] men who reject and turn their backs on the Truth.
Titus,1,15,To the pure [in heart and conscience] all things are pure but to the defiled and corrupt and unbelieving nothing is pure; their very minds and consciences are defiled and polluted.
Titus,1,16,They profess to know God [to recognize perceive and be acquainted with Him] but deny and disown and renounce Him by what they do; they are detestable and loathsome unbelieving and disobedient and disloyal and rebellious and [they are] unfit and worthless for good work (deed or enterprise) of any kind.
Titus,2,1,BUT [as for] you teach what is fitting and becoming to sound (wholesome) doctrine [the character and right living that identify true Christians].
Titus,2,2,Urge the older men to be temperate venerable (serious) sensible self-controlled and sound in the faith in the love and in the steadfastness and patience [of Christ].
Titus,2,3,Bid the older women similarly to be reverent and devout in their deportment as becomes those engaged in sacred service not slanderers or slaves to drink. They are to give good counsel and be teachers of what is right and noble
Titus,2,4,So that they will wisely train the young women to be sane and sober of mind (temperate disciplined) and to love their husbands and their children
Titus,2,5,To be self-controlled chaste homemakers good-natured (kindhearted) adapting and subordinating themselves to their husbands that the word of God may not be exposed to reproach (blasphemed or discredited).
Titus,2,6,In a similar way urge the younger men to be self-restrained and to behave prudently [taking life seriously].
Titus,2,7,And show your own self in all respects to be a pattern and a model of good deeds and works teaching what is unadulterated showing gravity [having the strictest regard for truth and purity of motive] with dignity and seriousness.
Titus,2,8,And let your instruction be sound and fit and wise and wholesome vigorous and irrefutable and above censure so that the opponent may be put to shame finding nothing discrediting or evil to say about us.
Titus,2,9,[Tell] bond servants to be submissive to their masters to be pleasing and give satisfaction in every way. [Warn them] not to talk back or contradict
Titus,2,10,Nor to steal by taking things of small value but to prove themselves truly loyal and entirely reliable and faithful throughout so that in everything they may be an ornament and do credit to the teaching [which is] from and about God our Savior.
Titus,2,11,For the grace of God (His unmerited favor and blessing) has come forward (appeared) for the deliverance from sin and the eternal salvation for all mankind.
Titus,2,12,It has trained us to reject and renounce all ungodliness (irreligion) and worldly (passionate) desires to live discreet (temperate self-controlled) upright devout (spiritually whole) lives in this present world
Titus,2,13,Awaiting and looking for the [fulfillment the realization of our] blessed hope even the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Christ Jesus (the Messiah the Anointed One)
Titus,2,14,Who gave Himself on our behalf that He might redeem us (purchase our freedom) from all iniquity and purify for Himself a people [to be peculiarly His own people who are] eager and enthusiastic about [living a life that is good and filled with] beneficial deeds.
Titus,2,15,Tell [them all] these things. Urge (advise encourage warn) and rebuke with full authority. Let no one despise or disregard or think little of you [conduct yourself and your teaching so as to command respect].
Titus,3,1,REMIND PEOPLE to be submissive to [their] magistrates and authorities to be obedient to be prepared and willing to do any upright and honorable work
Titus,3,2,To slander or abuse or speak evil of no one to avoid being contentious to be forbearing (yielding gentle and conciliatory) and to show unqualified courtesy toward everybody.
Titus,3,3,For we also were once thoughtless and senseless obstinate and disobedient deluded and misled; [we too were once] slaves to all sorts of cravings and pleasures wasting our days in malice and jealousy and envy hateful (hated detestable) and hating one another.
Titus,3,4,But when the goodness and loving-kindness of God our Savior to man [as man] appeared
Titus,3,5,He saved us not because of any works of righteousness that we had done but because of His own pity and mercy by [the] cleansing [bath] of the new birth (regeneration) and renewing of the Holy Spirit
Titus,3,6,Which He poured out [so] richly upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior.
Titus,3,7,[And He did it in order] that we might be justified by His grace (by His favor wholly undeserved) [that we might be acknowledged and counted as conformed to the divine will in purpose thought and action] and that we might become heirs of eternal life according to [our] hope.
Titus,3,8,This message is most trustworthy and concerning these things I want you to insist steadfastly so that those who have believed in (trusted in relied on) God may be careful to apply themselves to honorable occupations and to doing good for such things are [not only] excellent and right [in themselves] but [they are] good and profitable for the people.
Titus,3,9,But avoid stupid and foolish controversies and genealogies and dissensions and wrangling about the Law for they are unprofitable and futile.
Titus,3,10,[As for] a man who is factious [a heretical sectarian and cause of divisions] after admonishing him a first and second time reject [him from your fellowship and have nothing more to do with him]
Titus,3,11,Well aware that such a person has utterly changed (is perverted and corrupted); he goes on sinning [though he] is convicted of guilt and self-condemned.
Titus,3,12,When I send Artemas or [perhaps] Tychicus to you lose no time but make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis for I have decided to spend the winter there.
Titus,3,13,Do your utmost to speed Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way; see that they want for (lack) nothing.
Titus,3,14,And let our own [people really] learn to apply themselves to good deeds (to honest labor and honorable employment) so that they may be able to meet necessary demands whenever the occasion may require and not be living idle and uncultivated and unfruitful lives.
Titus,3,15,All who are with me wish to be remembered to you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace (God's favor and blessing) be with you all. Amen (so be it).
Philemon,1,1,PAUL A prisoner [for the sake] of Christ Jesus (the Messiah) and our brother Timothy to Philemon our dearly beloved sharer with us in our work
Philemon,1,2,And to Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier [in the Christian warfare] and to the church [assembly that meets] in your house:
Philemon,1,3,Grace (spiritual blessing and favor) be to all of you and [heart] peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah).
Philemon,1,4,I give thanks to my God for you always when I mention you in my prayers
Philemon,1,5,Because I continue to hear of your love and of your loyal faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and [which you show] toward all the saints (God's consecrated people).
Philemon,1,6,[And I pray] that the participation in and sharing of your faith may produce and promote full recognition and appreciation and understanding and precise knowledge of every good [thing] that is ours in [our identification with] Christ Jesus [and unto His glory].
Philemon,1,7,For I have derived great joy and comfort and encouragement from your love because the hearts of the saints [who are your fellow Christians] have been cheered and refreshed through you [my] brother.
Philemon,1,8,Therefore though I have abundant boldness in Christ to charge you to do what is fitting and required and your duty to do
Philemon,1,9,Yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you just for what I am--I Paul an ambassador [of Christ Jesus] and an old man and now a prisoner for His sake also--
Philemon,1,10,I appeal to you for my [own spiritual] child Onesimus [meaning profitable] whom I have begotten [in the faith] while a captive in these chains.
Philemon,1,11,Once he was unprofitable to you but now he is indeed profitable to you as well as to me.
Philemon,1,12,I am sending him back to you in his own person [and it is like sending] my very heart.
Philemon,1,13,I would have chosen to keep him with me in order that he might minister to my needs in your stead during my imprisonment for the Gospel's sake.
Philemon,1,14,But it has been my wish to do nothing about it without first consulting you and getting your consent in order that your benevolence might not seem to be the result of compulsion or of pressure but might be voluntary [on your part].
Philemon,1,15,Perhaps it was for this reason that he was separated [from you] for a while that you might have him back as yours forever
Philemon,1,16,Not as a slave any longer but as [something] more than a slave as a brother [Christian] especially dear to me but how much more to you both in the flesh [as a servant] and in the Lord [as a fellow believer].
Philemon,1,17,If then you consider me a partner and a comrade in fellowship welcome and receive him as you would [welcome and receive] me.
Philemon,1,18,And if he has done you any wrong in any way or owes anything [to you] charge that to my account.
Philemon,1,19,I Paul write it with my own hand I promise to repay it [in full]--and that is to say nothing [of the fact] that you owe me your very self!
Philemon,1,20,Yes brother let me have some profit from you in the Lord. Cheer and refresh my heart in Christ.
Philemon,1,21,I write to you [perfectly] confident of your obedient compliance knowing that you will do even more than I ask.
Philemon,1,22,At the same time prepare a guest room [in expectation of extending your hospitality] to me for I am hoping through your prayers to be granted [the gracious privilege of coming] to you.
Philemon,1,23,Greetings to you from Epaphras my fellow prisoner here in [the cause of] Christ Jesus (the Messiah)
Philemon,1,24,And [from] Mark Aristarchus Demas and Luke my fellow workers.
Philemon,1,25,The grace (blessing and favor) of the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) be with your spirit. Amen (so be it).
Hebrews,1,1,IN MANY separate revelations [ each of which set forth a portion of the Truth] and in different ways God spoke of old to [our] forefathers in and by the prophets
Hebrews,1,2,[But] in the last of these days He has spoken to us in [the person of a] Son Whom He appointed Heir and lawful Owner of all things also by and through Whom He created the worlds and the reaches of space and the ages of time [He made produced built operated and arranged them in order].
Hebrews,1,3,He is the sole expression of the glory of God [the Light-being the out-raying or radiance of the divine] and He is the perfect imprint and very image of [God's] nature upholding and maintaining and guiding and propelling the universe by His mighty word of power. When He had by offering Himself accomplished our cleansing of sins and riddance of guilt He sat down at the right hand of the divine Majesty on high
Hebrews,1,4,[Taking a place and rank by which] He Himself became as much superior to angels as the glorious Name (title) which He has inherited is different from and more excellent than theirs.
Hebrews,1,5,For to which of the angels did [God] ever say You are My Son today I have begotten You [established You in an official Sonship relation with kingly dignity]? And again I will be to Him a Father and He will be to Me a Son? [II Sam. 7:14; Ps. 2:7.]
Hebrews,1,6,Moreover when He brings the firstborn Son again into the habitable world He says Let all the angels of God worship Him.
Hebrews,1,7,Referring to the angels He says [God] Who makes His angels winds and His ministering servants flames of fire;
Hebrews,1,8,But as to the Son He says to Him Your throne O God is forever and ever (to the ages of the ages) and the scepter of Your kingdom is a scepter of absolute righteousness (of justice and straightforwardness).
Hebrews,1,9,You have loved righteousness [You have delighted in integrity virtue and uprightness in purpose thought and action] and You have hated lawlessness (injustice and iniquity). Therefore God [even] Your God ( Godhead) has anointed You with the oil of exultant joy and gladness above and beyond Your companions.
Hebrews,1,10,And [further] You Lord did lay the foundation of the earth in the beginning and the heavens are the works of Your hands.
Hebrews,1,11,They will perish but You remain and continue permanently; they will all grow old and wear out like a garment.
Hebrews,1,12,Like a mantle [thrown about one's self] You will roll them up and they will be changed and replaced by others. But You remain the same and Your years will never end nor come to failure.
Hebrews,1,13,Besides to which of the angels has He ever said Sit at My right hand [associated with Me in My royal dignity] till I make your enemies a stool for your feet?
Hebrews,1,14,Are not the angels all ministering spirits (servants) sent out in the service [of God for the assistance] of those who are to inherit salvation?
Hebrews,2,1,SINCE ALL this is true we ought to pay much closer attention than ever to the truths that we have heard lest in any way we drift past [them] and slip away.
Hebrews,2,2,For if the message given through angels [the Law spoken by them to Moses] was authentic and proved sure and every violation and disobedience received an appropriate (just and adequate) penalty
Hebrews,2,3,How shall we escape [appropriate retribution] if we neglect and refuse to pay attention to such a great salvation [as is now offered to us letting it drift past us forever]? For it was declared at first by the Lord [Himself] and it was confirmed to us and proved to be real and genuine by those who personally heard [Him speak].
Hebrews,2,4,[Besides this evidence] it was also established and plainly endorsed by God Who showed His approval of it by signs and wonders and various miraculous manifestations of [His] power and by imparting the gifts of the Holy Spirit [to the believers] according to His own will.
Hebrews,2,5,For it was not to angels that God subjected the habitable world of the future of which we are speaking.
Hebrews,2,6,It has been solemnly and earnestly said in a certain place What is man that You are mindful of him or the son of man that You graciously and helpfully care for and visit and look after him?
Hebrews,2,7,For some little time You have ranked him lower than and inferior to the angels; You have crowned him with glory and honor and set him over the works of Your hands
Hebrews,2,8,For You have put everything in subjection under his feet. Now in putting everything in subjection to man He left nothing outside [of man's] control. But at present we do not yet see all things subjected to him [man].
Hebrews,2,9,But we are able to see Jesus Who was ranked lower than the angels for a little while crowned with glory and honor because of His having suffered death in order that by the grace (unmerited favor) of God [to us sinners] He might experience death for every individual person.
Hebrews,2,10,For it was an act worthy [of God] and fitting [to the divine nature] that He for Whose sake and by Whom all things have their existence in bringing many sons into glory should make the Pioneer of their salvation perfect [should bring to maturity the human experience necessary to be perfectly equipped for His office as High Priest] through suffering.
Hebrews,2,11,For both He Who sanctifies [making men holy] and those who are sanctified all have one [Father]. For this reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren;
Hebrews,2,12,For He says I will declare Your [the Father's] name to My brethren; in the midst of the [worshiping] congregation I will sing hymns of praise to You.
Hebrews,2,13,And again He says My trust and assured reliance and confident hope shall be fixed in Him. And yet again Here I am I and the children whom God has given Me.
Hebrews,2,14,Since therefore [these His] children share in flesh and blood [in the physical nature of human beings] He [Himself] in a similar manner partook of the same [nature] that by [going through] death He might bring to nought and make of no effect him who had the power of death--that is the devil--
Hebrews,2,15,And also that He might deliver and completely set free all those who through the [haunting] fear of death were held in bondage throughout the whole course of their lives.
Hebrews,2,16,For as we all know He [Christ] did not take hold of angels [ the fallen angels to give them a helping and delivering hand] but He did take hold of [ the fallen] descendants of Abraham [to reach out to them a helping and delivering hand].
Hebrews,2,17,So it is evident that it was essential that He be made like His brethren in every respect in order that He might become a merciful (sympathetic) and faithful High Priest in the things related to God to make atonement and propitiation for the people's sins.
Hebrews,2,18,For because He Himself [in His humanity] has suffered in being tempted (tested and tried) He is able [immediately] to run to the cry of (assist relieve) those who are being tempted and tested and tried [and who therefore are being exposed to suffering].
Hebrews,3,1,SO THEN brethren consecrated and set apart for God who share in the heavenly calling [thoughtfully and attentively] consider Jesus the Apostle and High Priest Whom we confessed [as ours when we embraced the Christian faith].
Hebrews,3,2,[See how] faithful He was to Him Who appointed Him [Apostle and High Priest] as Moses was also faithful in the whole house [of God].
Hebrews,3,3,Yet Jesus has been considered worthy of much greater honor and glory than Moses just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house [itself].
Hebrews,3,4,For [of course] every house is built and furnished by someone but the Builder of all things and the Furnisher [of the entire equipment of all things] is God.
Hebrews,3,5,And Moses certainly was faithful in the administration of all God's house [but it was only] as a ministering servant. [In his entire ministry he was but] a testimony to the things which were to be spoken [the revelations to be given afterward in Christ].
Hebrews,3,6,But Christ (the Messiah) was faithful over His [own Father's] house as a Son [and Master of it]. And it is we who are [now members] of this house if we hold fast and firm to the end our joyful and exultant confidence and sense of triumph in our hope [in Christ].
Hebrews,3,7,Therefore as the Holy Spirit says: Today if you will hear His voice
Hebrews,3,8,Do not harden your hearts as [happened] in the rebellion [of Israel] and their provocation and embitterment [of Me] in the day of testing in the wilderness
Hebrews,3,9,Where your fathers tried [My patience] and tested [My forbearance] and found I stood their test and they saw My works for forty years.
Hebrews,3,10,And so I was provoked (displeased and sorely grieved) with that generation and said They always err and are led astray in their hearts and they have not perceived or recognized My ways and become progressively better and more experimentally and intimately acquainted with them.
Hebrews,3,11,Accordingly I swore in My wrath and indignation They shall not enter into My rest.
Hebrews,3,12,[Therefore beware] brethren take care lest there be in any one of you a wicked unbelieving heart [which refuses to cleave to trust in and rely on Him] leading you to turn away and desert or stand aloof from the living God.
Hebrews,3,13,But instead warn (admonish urge and encourage) one another every day as long as it is called Today that none of you may be hardened [into settled rebellion] by the deceitfulness of sin [by the fraudulence the stratagem the trickery which the delusive glamor of his sin may play on him].
Hebrews,3,14,For we have become fellows with Christ (the Messiah) and share in all He has for us if only we hold our first newborn confidence and original assured expectation [in virtue of which we are believers] firm and unshaken to the end.
Hebrews,3,15,Then while it is [still] called Today if you would hear His voice and when you hear it do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion [in the desert when the people provoked and irritated and embittered God against them].
Hebrews,3,16,For who were they who heard and yet were rebellious and provoked [Him]? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses?
Hebrews,3,17,And with whom was He irritated and provoked and grieved for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned whose dismembered bodies were strewn and left in the desert?
Hebrews,3,18,And to whom did He swear that they should not enter His rest but to those who disobeyed [who had not listened to His word and who refused to be compliant or be persuaded]?
Hebrews,3,19,So we see that they were not able to enter [into His rest] because of their unwillingness to adhere to and trust in and rely on God [unbelief had shut them out].
Hebrews,4,1,THEREFORE WHILE the promise of entering His rest still holds and is offered [today] let us be afraid [ to distrust it] lest any of you should think he has come too late and has come short of [reaching] it.
Hebrews,4,2,For indeed we have had the glad tidings [Gospel of God] proclaimed to us just as truly as they [the Israelites of old did when the good news of deliverance from bondage came to them]; but the message they heard did not benefit them because it was not mixed with faith (with the leaning of the entire personality on God in absolute trust and confidence in His power wisdom and goodness) by those who heard it; neither were they united in faith with the ones [Joshua and Caleb] who heard (did believe).
Hebrews,4,3,For we who have believed (adhered to and trusted in and relied on God) do enter that rest in accordance with His declaration that those [who did not believe] should not enter when He said As I swore in My wrath They shall not enter My rest; and this He said although [His] works had been completed and prepared [and waiting for all who would believe] from the foundation of the world.
Hebrews,4,4,For in a certain place He has said this about the seventh day: And God rested on the seventh day from all His works.
Hebrews,4,5,And [they forfeited their part in it for] in this [passage] He said They shall not enter My rest.
Hebrews,4,6,Seeing then that the promise remains over [from past times] for some to enter that rest and that those who formerly were given the good news about it and the opportunity failed to appropriate it and did not enter because of disobedience
Hebrews,4,7,Again He sets a definite day [a new] Today [and gives another opportunity of securing that rest] saying through David after so long a time in the words already quoted Today if you would hear His voice and when you hear it do not harden your hearts.
Hebrews,4,8,[This mention of a rest was not a reference to their entering into Canaan.] For if Joshua had given them rest He [God] would not speak afterward about another day.
Hebrews,4,9,So then there is still awaiting a full and complete Sabbath-rest reserved for the [true] people of God;
Hebrews,4,10,For he who has once entered [God's] rest also has ceased from [the weariness and pain] of human labors just as God rested from those labors peculiarly His own.
Hebrews,4,11,Let us therefore be zealous and exert ourselves and strive diligently to enter that rest [of God to know and experience it for ourselves] that no one may fall or perish by the same kind of unbelief and disobedience [into which those in the wilderness fell].
Hebrews,4,12,For the Word that God speaks is alive and full of power [making it active operative energizing and effective]; it is sharper than any two-edged sword penetrating to the dividing line of the breath of life (soul) and [the immortal] spirit and of joints and marrow [of the deepest parts of our nature] exposing and sifting and analyzing and judging the very thoughts and purposes of the heart.
Hebrews,4,13,And not a creature exists that is concealed from His sight but all things are open and exposed naked and defenseless to the eyes of Him with Whom we have to do.
Hebrews,4,14,Inasmuch then as we have a great High Priest Who has [already] ascended and passed through the heavens Jesus the Son of God let us hold fast our confession [of faith in Him].
Hebrews,4,15,For we do not have a High Priest Who is unable to understand and sympathize and have a shared feeling with our weaknesses and infirmities and liability to the assaults of temptation but One Who has been tempted in every respect as we are yet without sinning.
Hebrews,4,16,Let us then fearlessly and confidently and boldly draw near to the throne of grace (the throne of God's unmerited favor to us sinners) that we may receive mercy [for our failures] and find grace to help in good time for every need [appropriate help and well-timed help coming just when we need it].
Hebrews,5,1,FOR EVERY high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act on behalf of men in things relating to God to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.
Hebrews,5,2,He is able to exercise gentleness and forbearance toward the ignorant and erring since he himself also is liable to moral weakness and physical infirmity.
Hebrews,5,3,And because of this he is obliged to offer sacrifice for his own sins as well as for those of the people.
Hebrews,5,4,Besides one does not appropriate for himself the honor [of being high priest] but he is called by God and receives it of Him just as Aaron did.
Hebrews,5,5,So too Christ (the Messiah) did not exalt Himself to be made a high priest but was appointed and exalted by Him Who said to Him You are My Son; today I have begotten You;
Hebrews,5,6,As He says also in another place You are a Priest [appointed] forever after the order (with the rank) of Melchizedek.
Hebrews,5,7,In the days of His flesh [Jesus] offered up definite special petitions [for that which He not only wanted but needed] and supplications with strong crying and tears to Him Who was [always] able to save Him [out] from death and He was heard because of His reverence toward God [His godly fear His piety in that He shrank from the horrors of separation from the bright presence of the Father].
Hebrews,5,8,Although He was a Son He learned [active special] obedience through what He suffered
Hebrews,5,9,And [His completed experience] making Him perfectly [equipped] He became the Author and Source of eternal salvation to all those who give heed and obey Him
Hebrews,5,10,Being designated and recognized and saluted by God as High Priest after the order (with the rank) of Melchizedek.
Hebrews,5,11,Concerning this we have much to say which is hard to explain since you have become dull in your [spiritual] hearing and sluggish [even slothful in achieving spiritual insight].
Hebrews,5,12,For even though by this time you ought to be teaching others you actually need someone to teach you over again the very first principles of God's Word. You have come to need milk not solid food.
Hebrews,5,13,For everyone who continues to feed on milk is obviously inexperienced and unskilled in the doctrine of righteousness (of conformity to the divine will in purpose thought and action) for he is a mere infant [not able to talk yet]!
Hebrews,5,14,But solid food is for full-grown men for those whose senses and mental faculties are trained by practice to discriminate and distinguish between what is morally good and noble and what is evil and contrary either to divine or human law.
Hebrews,6,1,THEREFORE LET us go on and get past the elementary stage in the teachings and doctrine of Christ (the Messiah) advancing steadily toward the completeness and perfection that belong to spiritual maturity. Let us not again be laying the foundation of repentance and abandonment of dead works (dead formalism) and of the faith [by which you turned] to God
Hebrews,6,2,With teachings about purifying the laying on of hands the resurrection from the dead and eternal judgment and punishment. [These are all matters of which you should have been fully aware long long ago.]
Hebrews,6,3,If indeed God permits we will [now] proceed [to advanced teaching].
Hebrews,6,4,For it is impossible [to restore and bring again to repentance] those who have been once for all enlightened who have consciously tasted the heavenly gift and have become sharers of the Holy Spirit
Hebrews,6,5,And have felt how good the Word of God is and the mighty powers of the age and world to come
Hebrews,6,6,If they then deviate from the faith and turn away from their allegiance--[it is impossible] to bring them back to repentance for (because while as long as) they nail upon the cross the Son of God afresh [as far as they are concerned] and are holding [Him] up to contempt and shame and public disgrace.
Hebrews,6,7,For the soil which has drunk the rain that repeatedly falls upon it and produces vegetation useful to those for whose benefit it is cultivated partakes of a blessing from God.
Hebrews,6,8,But if [that same soil] persistently bears thorns and thistles it is considered worthless and near to being cursed whose end is to be burned.
Hebrews,6,9,Even though we speak this way yet in your case beloved we are now firmly convinced of better things that are near to salvation and accompany it.
Hebrews,6,10,For God is not unrighteous to forget or overlook your labor and the love which you have shown for His name's sake in ministering to the needs of the saints (His own consecrated people) as you still do.
Hebrews,6,11,But we do [ strongly and earnestly] desire for each of you to show the same diligence and sincerity [all the way through] in realizing and enjoying the full assurance and development of [your] hope until the end
Hebrews,6,12,In order that you may not grow disinterested and become [spiritual] sluggards but imitators behaving as do those who through faith ( by their leaning of the entire personality on God in Christ in absolute trust and confidence in His power wisdom and goodness) and by practice of patient endurance and waiting are [now] inheriting the promises.
Hebrews,6,13,For when God made [His] promise to Abraham He swore by Himself since He had no one greater by whom to swear
Hebrews,6,14,Saying Blessing I certainly will bless you and multiplying I will multiply you.
Hebrews,6,15,And so it was that he [Abraham] having waited long and endured patiently realized and obtained [in the birth of Isaac as a pledge of what was to come] what God had promised him.
Hebrews,6,16,Men indeed swear by a greater [than themselves] and with them in all disputes the oath taken for confirmation is final [ending strife].
Hebrews,6,17,Accordingly God also in His desire to show more convincingly and beyond doubt to those who were to inherit the promise the unchangeableness of His purpose and plan intervened (mediated) with an oath.
Hebrews,6,18,This was so that by two unchangeable things [His promise and His oath] in which it is impossible for God ever to prove false or deceive us we who have fled [to Him] for refuge might have mighty indwelling strength and strong encouragement to grasp and hold fast the hope appointed for us and set before [us].
Hebrews,6,19,[Now] we have this [hope] as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul [it cannot slip and it cannot break down under whoever steps out upon it--a hope] that reaches farther and enters into [the very certainty of the Presence] within the veil
Hebrews,6,20,Where Jesus has entered in for us [in advance] a Forerunner having become a High Priest forever after the order (with the rank) of Melchizedek.
Hebrews,7,1,FOR THIS Melchizedek king of Salem [and] priest of the Most High God met Abraham as he returned from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him
Hebrews,7,2,And Abraham gave to him a tenth portion of all [the spoil]. He is primarily as his name when translated indicates king of righteousness and then he is also king of Salem which means king of peace.
Hebrews,7,3,Without [record of] father or mother or ancestral line neither with beginning of days nor ending of life but resembling the Son of God he continues to be a priest without interruption and without successor.
Hebrews,7,4,Now observe and consider how great [a personage] this was to whom even Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth [the topmost or the pick of the heap] of the spoils.
Hebrews,7,5,And it is true that those descendants of Levi who are charged with the priestly office are commanded in the Law to take tithes from the people--which means from their brethren--though these have descended from Abraham.
Hebrews,7,6,But this person who has not their Levitical ancestry received tithes from Abraham [himself] and blessed him who possessed the promises [of God].
Hebrews,7,7,Yet it is beyond all contradiction that it is the lesser person who is blessed by the greater one.
Hebrews,7,8,Furthermore here [in the Levitical priesthood] tithes are received by men who are subject to death; while there [in the case of Melchizedek] they are received by one of whom it is testified that he lives [perpetually].
Hebrews,7,9,A person might even say that Levi [the father of the priestly tribe] himself who received tithes (the tenth) paid tithes through Abraham
Hebrews,7,10,For he was still in the loins of his forefather [Abraham] when Melchizedek met him [Abraham].
Hebrews,7,11,Now if perfection (a perfect fellowship between God and the worshiper) had been attainable by the Levitical priesthood--for under it the people were given the Law--why was it further necessary that there should arise another and different kind of Priest one after the order of Melchizedek rather than one appointed after the order and rank of Aaron?
Hebrews,7,12,For when there is a change in the priesthood there is of necessity an alteration of the law [concerning the priesthood] as well.
Hebrews,7,13,For the One of Whom these things are said belonged [not to the priestly line but] to another tribe no member of which has officiated at the altar.
Hebrews,7,14,For it is obvious that our Lord sprang from the tribe of Judah and Moses mentioned nothing about priests in connection with that tribe.
Hebrews,7,15,And this becomes more plainly evident when another Priest arises Who bears the likeness of Melchizedek
Hebrews,7,16,Who has been constituted a Priest not on the basis of a bodily legal requirement [an externally imposed command concerning His physical ancestry] but on the basis of the power of an endless and indestructible Life.
Hebrews,7,17,For it is witnessed of Him You are a Priest forever after the order (with the rank) of Melchizedek.
Hebrews,7,18,So a previous physical regulation and command is cancelled because of its weakness and ineffectiveness and uselessness--
Hebrews,7,19,For the Law never made anything perfect--but instead a better hope is introduced through which we [now] come close to God.
Hebrews,7,20,And it was not without the taking of an oath [that Christ was made Priest]
Hebrews,7,21,For those who formerly became priests received their office without its being confirmed by the taking of an oath by God but this One was designated and addressed and saluted with an oath The Lord has sworn and will not regret it or change His mind You are a Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
Hebrews,7,22,In keeping with [the oath's greater strength and force] Jesus has become the Guarantee of a better (stronger) agreement [a more excellent and more advantageous covenant].
Hebrews,7,23,[Again the former successive line of priests] was made up of many because they were each prevented by death from continuing [perpetually in office];
Hebrews,7,24,But He holds His priesthood unchangeably because He lives on forever.
Hebrews,7,25,Therefore He is able also to save to the uttermost (completely perfectly finally and for all time and eternity) those who come to God through Him since He is always living to make petition to God and intercede with Him and intervene for them.
Hebrews,7,26,[Here is] the High Priest [perfectly adapted] to our needs as was fitting--holy blameless unstained by sin separated from sinners and exalted higher than the heavens.
Hebrews,7,27,He has no day by day necessity as [do each of these other] high priests to offer sacrifice first of all for his own [personal] sins and then for those of the people because He [met all the requirements] once for all when He brought Himself [as a sacrifice] which He offered up.
Hebrews,7,28,For the Law sets up men in their weakness [frail sinful dying human beings] as high priests but the word of [God's] oath which [was spoken later] after the institution of the Law [chooses and appoints as priest One Whose appointment is complete and permanent] a Son Who has been made perfect forever.
Hebrews,8,1,NOW THE main point of what we have to say is this: We have such a High Priest One Who is seated at the right hand of the majestic [God] in heaven
Hebrews,8,2,As officiating Priest a Minister in the holy places and in the true tabernacle which is erected not by man but by the Lord.
Hebrews,8,3,For every high priest is appointed to offer up gifts and sacrifices; so it is essential for this [High Priest] to have some offering to make also.
Hebrews,8,4,If then He were still living on earth He would not be a priest at all for there are [already priests] who offer the gifts in accordance with the Law.
Hebrews,8,5,[But these offer] service [merely] as a pattern and as a foreshadowing of [what has its true existence and reality in] the heavenly sanctuary. For when Moses was about to erect the tabernacle he was warned by God saying See to it that you make it all [exactly] according to the copy (the model) which was shown to you on the mountain.
Hebrews,8,6,But as it now is He [Christ] has acquired a [priestly] ministry which is as much superior and more excellent [than the old] as the covenant (the agreement) of which He is the Mediator (the Arbiter Agent) is superior and more excellent [because] it is enacted and rests upon more important (sublimer higher and nobler) promises.
Hebrews,8,7,For if that first covenant had been without defect there would have been no room for another one or an attempt to institute another one.
Hebrews,8,8,However He finds fault with them [showing its inadequacy] when He says Behold the days will come says the Lord when I will make and ratify a new covenant or agreement with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.
Hebrews,8,9,It will not be like the covenant that I made with their forefathers on the day when I grasped them by the hand to help and relieve them and to lead them out from the land of Egypt for they did not abide in My agreement with them and so I withdrew My favor and disregarded them says the Lord.
Hebrews,8,10,For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days says the Lord: I will imprint My laws upon their minds even upon their innermost thoughts and understanding and engrave them upon their hearts; and I will be their God and they shall be My people.
Hebrews,8,11,And it will nevermore be necessary for each one to teach his neighbor and his fellow citizen or each one his brother saying Know (perceive have knowledge of and get acquainted by experience with) the Lord for all will know Me from the smallest to the greatest of them.
Hebrews,8,12,For I will be merciful and gracious toward their sins and I will remember their deeds of unrighteousness no more.
Hebrews,8,13,When God speaks of a new [covenant or agreement] He makes the first one obsolete (out of use). And what is obsolete (out of use and annulled because of age) is ripe for disappearance and to be dispensed with altogether.
Hebrews,9,1,NOW EVEN the first covenant had its own rules and regulations for divine worship and it had a sanctuary [but one] of this world.
Hebrews,9,2,For a tabernacle (tent) was erected in the outer division or compartment of which were the lampstand and the table with [its loaves of] the showbread set forth. [This portion] is called the Holy Place.
Hebrews,9,3,But [inside] beyond the second curtain or veil [there stood another] tabernacle [division] known as the Holy of Holies.
Hebrews,9,4,It had the golden altar of incense and the ark (chest) of the covenant covered over with wrought gold. This [ark] contained a golden jar which held the manna and the rod of Aaron that sprouted and the [two stone] slabs of the covenant [bearing the Ten Commandments].
Hebrews,9,5,Above [the ark] and overshadowing the mercy seat were the representations of the cherubim [winged creatures which were the symbols] of glory. We cannot now go into detail about these things.
Hebrews,9,6,These arrangements having thus been made the priests enter [habitually] into the outer division of the tabernacle in performance of their ritual acts of worship.
Hebrews,9,7,But into the second [division of the tabernacle] none but the high priest goes and he only once a year and never without taking a sacrifice of blood with him which he offers for himself and for the errors and sins of ignorance and thoughtlessness which the people have committed.
Hebrews,9,8,By this the Holy Spirit points out that the way into the [true Holy of] Holies is not yet thrown open as long as the former [the outer portion of the] tabernacle remains a recognized institution and is still standing
Hebrews,9,9,Seeing that that first [outer portion of the] tabernacle was a parable (a visible symbol or type or picture of the present age). In it gifts and sacrifices are offered and yet are incapable of perfecting the conscience or of cleansing and renewing the inner man of the worshiper.
Hebrews,9,10,For [the ceremonies] deal only with clean and unclean meats and drinks and different washings [mere] external rules and regulations for the body imposed to tide the worshipers over until the time of setting things straight [of reformation of the complete new order when Christ the Messiah shall establish the reality of what these things foreshadow--a better covenant].
Hebrews,9,11,But [that appointed time came] when Christ (the Messiah) appeared as a High Priest of the better things that have come and are to come. [Then] through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with [human] hands that is not a part of this material creation
Hebrews,9,12,He went once for all into the [Holy of] Holies [of heaven] not by virtue of the blood of goats and calves [by which to make reconciliation between God and man] but His own blood having found and secured a complete redemption (an everlasting release for us).
Hebrews,9,13,For if [the mere] sprinkling of unholy and defiled persons with blood of goats and bulls and with the ashes of a burnt heifer is sufficient for the purification of the body
Hebrews,9,14,How much more surely shall the blood of Christ Who by virtue of [His] eternal Spirit [His own preexistent divine personality] has offered Himself as an unblemished sacrifice to God purify our consciences from dead works and lifeless observances to serve the [ever] living God?
Hebrews,9,15,[Christ the Messiah] is therefore the Negotiator and Mediator of an [entirely] new agreement (testament covenant) so that those who are called and offered it may receive the fulfillment of the promised everlasting inheritance--since a death has taken place which rescues and delivers and redeems them from the transgressions committed under the [old] first agreement.
Hebrews,9,16,For where there is a [last] will and testament involved the death of the one who made it must be established
Hebrews,9,17,For a will and testament is valid and takes effect only at death since it has no force or legal power as long as the one who made it is alive.
Hebrews,9,18,So even the [old] first covenant (God's will) was not inaugurated and ratified and put in force without the shedding of blood.
Hebrews,9,19,For when every command of the Law had been read out by Moses to all the people he took the blood of slain calves and goats together with water and scarlet wool and with a bunch of hyssop and sprinkled both the Book (the roll of the Law and covenant) itself and all the people
Hebrews,9,20,Saying these words: This is the blood that seals and ratifies the agreement (the testament the covenant) which God commanded [me to deliver to] you.
Hebrews,9,21,And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and all the [sacred] vessels and appliances used in [divine] worship.
Hebrews,9,22,[In fact] under the Law almost everything is purified by means of blood and without the shedding of blood there is neither release from sin and its guilt nor the remission of the due and merited punishment for sins.
Hebrews,9,23,By such means therefore it was necessary for the [earthly] copies of the heavenly things to be purified but the actual heavenly things themselves [required far] better and nobler sacrifices than these.
Hebrews,9,24,For Christ (the Messiah) has not entered into a sanctuary made with [human] hands only a copy and pattern and type of the true one but [He has entered] into heaven itself now to appear in the [very] presence of God on our behalf.
Hebrews,9,25,Nor did He [enter into the heavenly sanctuary to] offer Himself regularly again and again as the high priest enters the [Holy of] Holies every year with blood not his own.
Hebrews,9,26,For then would He often have had to suffer [over and over again] since the foundation of the world. But as it now is He has once for all at the consummation and close of the ages appeared to put away and abolish sin by His sacrifice [of Himself].
Hebrews,9,27,And just as it is appointed for [all] men once to die and after that the [certain] judgment
Hebrews,9,28,Even so it is that Christ having been offered to take upon Himself and bear as a burden the sins of many once and once for all will appear a second time not to carry any burden of sin nor to deal with sin but to bring to full salvation those who are [eagerly constantly and patiently] waiting for and expecting Him.
Hebrews,10,1,FOR SINCE the Law has merely a rude outline (foreshadowing) of the good things to come--instead of fully expressing those things--it can never by offering the same sacrifices continually year after year make perfect those who approach [its altars].
Hebrews,10,2,For if it were otherwise would [these sacrifices] not have stopped being offered? Since the worshipers had once for all been cleansed they would no longer have any guilt or consciousness of sin.
Hebrews,10,3,But [as it is] these sacrifices annually bring a fresh remembrance of sins [to be atoned for]
Hebrews,10,4,Because the blood of bulls and goats is powerless to take sins away.
Hebrews,10,5,Hence when He [Christ] entered into the world He said Sacrifices and offerings You have not desired but instead You have made ready a body for Me [to offer];
Hebrews,10,6,In burnt offerings and sin offerings You have taken no delight.
Hebrews,10,7,Then I said Behold here I am coming to do Your will O God--[to fulfill] what is written of Me in the volume of the Book.
Hebrews,10,8,When He said just before You have neither desired nor have You taken delight in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings--all of which are offered according to the Law--
Hebrews,10,9,He then went on to say Behold [here] I am coming to do Your will. Thus He does away with and annuls the first (former) order [as a means of expiating sin] so that He might inaugurate and establish the second (latter) order.
Hebrews,10,10,And in accordance with this will [of God] we have been made holy (consecrated and sanctified) through the offering made once for all of the body of Jesus Christ (the Anointed One).
Hebrews,10,11,Furthermore every [human] priest stands [at his altar of service] ministering daily offering the same sacrifices over and over again which never are able to strip [from every side of us] the sins [that envelop us] and take them away--
Hebrews,10,12,Whereas this One [Christ] after He had offered a single sacrifice for our sins [that shall avail] for all time sat down at the right hand of God
Hebrews,10,13,Then to wait until His enemies should be made a stool beneath His feet.
Hebrews,10,14,For by a single offering He has forever completely cleansed and perfected those who are consecrated and made holy.
Hebrews,10,15,And also the Holy Spirit adds His testimony to us [in confirmation of this]. For having said
Hebrews,10,16,This is the agreement (testament covenant) that I will set up and conclude with them after those days says the Lord: I will imprint My laws upon their hearts and I will inscribe them on their minds (on their inmost thoughts and understanding)
Hebrews,10,17,He then goes on to say And their sins and their lawbreaking I will remember no more.
Hebrews,10,18,Now where there is absolute remission (forgiveness and cancellation of the penalty) of these [sins and lawbreaking] there is no longer any offering made to atone for sin.
Hebrews,10,19,Therefore brethren since we have full freedom and confidence to enter into the [Holy of] Holies [by the power and virtue] in the blood of Jesus
Hebrews,10,20,By this fresh (new) and living way which He initiated and dedicated and opened for us through the separating curtain (veil of the Holy of Holies) that is through His flesh
Hebrews,10,21,And since we have [such] a great and wonderful and noble Priest [Who rules] over the house of God
Hebrews,10,22,Let us all come forward and draw near with true (honest and sincere) hearts in unqualified assurance and absolute conviction engendered by faith (by that leaning of the entire human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence in His power wisdom and goodness) having our hearts sprinkled and purified from a guilty (evil) conscience and our bodies cleansed with pure water.
Hebrews,10,23,So let us seize and hold fast and retain without wavering the hope we cherish and confess and our acknowledgement of it for He Who promised is reliable (sure) and faithful to His word.
Hebrews,10,24,And let us consider and give attentive continuous care to watching over one another studying how we may stir up (stimulate and incite) to love and helpful deeds and noble activities
Hebrews,10,25,Not forsaking or neglecting to assemble together [as believers] as is the habit of some people but admonishing (warning urging and encouraging) one another and all the more faithfully as you see the day approaching.
Hebrews,10,26,For if we go on deliberately and willingly sinning after once acquiring the knowledge of the Truth there is no longer any sacrifice left to atone for [our] sins [no further offering to which to look forward].
Hebrews,10,27,[There is nothing left for us then] but a kind of awful and fearful prospect and expectation of divine judgment and the fury of burning wrath and indignation which will consume those who put themselves in opposition [to God].
Hebrews,10,28,Any person who has violated and [thus] rejected and set at naught the Law of Moses is put to death without pity or mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses.
Hebrews,10,29,How much worse (sterner and heavier) punishment do you suppose he will be judged to deserve who has spurned and [thus] trampled underfoot the Son of God and who has considered the covenant blood by which he was consecrated common and unhallowed thus profaning it and insulting and outraging the [Holy] Spirit [Who imparts] grace (the unmerited favor and blessing of God)?
Hebrews,10,30,For we know Him Who said Vengeance is Mine [retribution and the meting out of full justice rest with Me]; I will repay [I will exact the compensation] says the Lord. And again The Lord will judge and determine and solve and settle the cause and the cases of His people.
Hebrews,10,31,It is a fearful (formidable and terrible) thing to incur the divine penalties and be cast into the hands of the living God!
Hebrews,10,32,But be ever mindful of the days gone by in which after you were first spiritually enlightened you endured a great and painful struggle
Hebrews,10,33,Sometimes being yourselves a gazingstock publicly exposed to insults and abuse and distress and sometimes claiming fellowship and making common cause with others who were so treated.
Hebrews,10,34,For you did sympathize and suffer along with those who were imprisoned and you bore cheerfully the plundering of your belongings and the confiscation of your property in the knowledge and consciousness that you yourselves had a better and lasting possession.
Hebrews,10,35,Do not therefore fling away your fearless confidence for it carries a great and glorious compensation of reward.
Hebrews,10,36,For you have need of steadfast patience and endurance so that you may perform and fully accomplish the will of God and thus receive and carry away [and enjoy to the full] what is promised.
Hebrews,10,37,For still a little while (a very little while) and the Coming One will come and He will not delay.
Hebrews,10,38,But the just shall live by faith [My righteous servant shall live by his conviction respecting man's relationship to God and divine things and holy fervor born of faith and conjoined with it]; and if he draws back and shrinks in fear My soul has no delight or pleasure in him.
Hebrews,10,39,But our way is not that of those who draw back to eternal misery (perdition) and are utterly destroyed but we are of those who believe [who cleave to and trust in and rely on God through Jesus Christ the Messiah] and by faith preserve the soul.
Hebrews,11,1,NOW FAITH is the assurance (the confirmation the title deed) of the things [we] hope for being the proof of things [we] do not see and the conviction of their reality [faith perceiving as real fact what is not revealed to the senses].
Hebrews,11,2,For by [faith--trust and holy fervor born of faith] the men of old had divine testimony borne to them and obtained a good report.
Hebrews,11,3,By faith we understand that the worlds [during the successive ages] were framed (fashioned put in order and equipped for their intended purpose) by the word of God so that what we see was not made out of things which are visible.
Hebrews,11,4,[Prompted actuated] by faith Abel brought God a better and more acceptable sacrifice than Cain because of which it was testified of him that he was righteous [that he was upright and in right standing with God] and God bore witness by accepting and acknowledging his gifts. And though he died yet [through the incident] he is still speaking.
Hebrews,11,5,Because of faith Enoch was caught up and transferred to heaven so that he did not have a glimpse of death; and he was not found because God had translated him. For even before he was taken to heaven he received testimony [still on record] that he had pleased and been satisfactory to God.
Hebrews,11,6,But without faith it is impossible to please and be satisfactory to Him. For whoever would come near to God must [necessarily] believe that God exists and that He is the rewarder of those who earnestly and diligently seek Him [out].
Hebrews,11,7,[Prompted] by faith Noah being forewarned by God concerning events of which as yet there was no visible sign took heed and diligently and reverently constructed and prepared an ark for the deliverance of his own family. By this [his faith which relied on God] he passed judgment and sentence on the world's unbelief and became an heir and possessor of righteousness ( that relation of being right into which God puts the person who has faith).
Hebrews,11,8,[Urged on] by faith Abraham when he was called obeyed and went forth to a place which he was destined to receive as an inheritance; and he went although he did not know or trouble his mind about where he was to go.
Hebrews,11,9,[Prompted] by faith he dwelt as a temporary resident in the land which was designated in the promise [of God though he was like a stranger] in a strange country living in tents with Isaac and Jacob fellow heirs with him of the same promise.
Hebrews,11,10,For he was [waiting expectantly and confidently] looking forward to the city which has fixed and firm foundations whose Architect and Builder is God.
Hebrews,11,11,Because of faith also Sarah herself received physical power to conceive a child even when she was long past the age for it because she considered [God] Who had given her the promise to be reliable and trustworthy and true to His word.
Hebrews,11,12,So from one man though he was physically as good as dead there have sprung descendants whose number is as the stars of heaven and as countless as the innumerable sands on the seashore.
Hebrews,11,13,These people all died controlled and sustained by their faith but not having received the tangible fulfillment of [God's] promises only having seen it and greeted it from a great distance by faith and all the while acknowledging and confessing that they were strangers and temporary residents and exiles upon the earth.
Hebrews,11,14,Now those people who talk as they did show plainly that they are in search of a fatherland (their own country).
Hebrews,11,15,If they had been thinking with [homesick] remembrance of that country from which they were emigrants they would have found constant opportunity to return to it.
Hebrews,11,16,But the truth is that they were yearning for and aspiring to a better and more desirable country that is a heavenly [one]. For that reason God is not ashamed to be called their God [even to be surnamed their God--the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob] for He has prepared a city for them.
Hebrews,11,17,By faith Abraham when he was put to the test [while the testing of his faith was still in progress] had already brought Isaac for an offering; he who had gladly received and welcomed [God's] promises was ready to sacrifice his only son
Hebrews,11,18,Of whom it was said Through Isaac shall your descendants be reckoned.
Hebrews,11,19,For he reasoned that God was able to raise [him] up even from among the dead. Indeed in the sense that Isaac was figuratively dead [potentially sacrificed] he did [actually] receive him back from the dead.
Hebrews,11,20,[With eyes of] faith Isaac looking far into the future invoked blessings upon Jacob and Esau.
Hebrews,11,21,[Prompted] by faith Jacob when he was dying blessed each of Joseph's sons and bowed in prayer over the top of his staff.
Hebrews,11,22,[Actuated] by faith Joseph when nearing the end of his life referred to [the promise of God for] the departure of the Israelites out of Egypt and gave instructions concerning the burial of his own bones.
Hebrews,11,23,[Prompted] by faith Moses after his birth was kept concealed for three months by his parents because they saw how comely the child was; and they were not overawed and terrified by the king's decree.
Hebrews,11,24,[Aroused] by faith Moses when he had grown to maturity and become great refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter
Hebrews,11,25,Because he preferred to share the oppression [suffer the hardships] and bear the shame of the people of God rather than to have the fleeting enjoyment of a sinful life.
Hebrews,11,26,He considered the contempt and abuse and shame [borne for] the Christ (the Messiah Who was to come) to be greater wealth than all the treasures of Egypt for he looked forward and away to the reward (recompense).
Hebrews,11,27,[Motivated] by faith he left Egypt behind him being unawed and undismayed by the wrath of the king; for he never flinched but held staunchly to his purpose and endured steadfastly as one who gazed on Him Who is invisible.
Hebrews,11,28,By faith (simple trust and confidence in God) he instituted and carried out the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood [on the doorposts] so that the destroyer of the firstborn (the angel) might not touch those [of the children of Israel].
Hebrews,11,29,[Urged on] by faith the people crossed the Red Sea as [though] on dry land but when the Egyptians tried to do the same thing they were swallowed up [by the sea].
Hebrews,11,30,Because of faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encompassed for seven days [by the Israelites].
Hebrews,11,31,[Prompted] by faith Rahab the prostitute was not destroyed along with those who refused to believe and obey because she had received the spies in peace [without enmity].
Hebrews,11,32,And what shall I say further? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon Barak Samson Jephthah of David and Samuel and the prophets
Hebrews,11,33,Who by [the help of] faith subdued kingdoms administered justice obtained promised blessings closed the mouths of lions
Hebrews,11,34,Extinguished the power of raging fire escaped the devourings of the sword out of frailty and weakness won strength and became stalwart even mighty and resistless in battle routing alien hosts.
Hebrews,11,35,[Some] women received again their dead by a resurrection. Others were tortured to death with clubs refusing to accept release [offered on the terms of denying their faith] so that they might be resurrected to a better life. [I Kings 17:17-24; II Kings 4:25-37.]
Hebrews,11,36,Others had to suffer the trial of mocking and scourging and even chains and imprisonment.
Hebrews,11,37,They were stoned to death; they were lured with tempting offers [to renounce their faith]; they were sawn asunder; they were slaughtered by the sword; [while they were alive] they had to go about wrapped in the skins of sheep and goats utterly destitute oppressed cruelly treated--
Hebrews,11,38,[Men] of whom the world was not worthy--roaming over the desolate places and the mountains and [living] in caves and caverns and holes of the earth.
Hebrews,11,39,And all of these though they won divine approval by [means of] their faith did not receive the fulfillment of what was promised
Hebrews,11,40,Because God had us in mind and had something better and greater in view for us so that they [these heroes and heroines of faith] should not come to perfection apart from us [before we could join them].
Hebrews,12,1,THEREFORE THEN since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses [who have borne testimony to the Truth] let us strip off and throw aside every encumbrance (unnecessary weight) and that sin which so readily (deftly and cleverly) clings to and entangles us and let us run with patient endurance and steady and active persistence the appointed course of the race that is set before us
Hebrews,12,2,Looking away [from all that will distract] to Jesus Who is the Leader and the Source of our faith [giving the first incentive for our belief] and is also its Finisher [bringing it to maturity and perfection]. He for the joy [of obtaining the prize] that was set before Him endured the cross despising and ignoring the shame and is now seated at the right hand of the throne of God.
Hebrews,12,3,Just think of Him Who endured from sinners such grievous opposition and bitter hostility against Himself [reckon up and consider it all in comparison with your trials] so that you may not grow weary or exhausted losing heart and relaxing and fainting in your minds.
Hebrews,12,4,You have not yet struggled and fought agonizingly against sin nor have you yet resisted and withstood to the point of pouring out your [own] blood.
Hebrews,12,5,And have you [completely] forgotten the divine word of appeal and encouragement in which you are reasoned with and addressed as sons? My son do not think lightly or scorn to submit to the correction and discipline of the Lord nor lose courage and give up and faint when you are reproved or corrected by Him;
Hebrews,12,6,For the Lord corrects and disciplines everyone whom He loves and He punishes even scourges every son whom He accepts and welcomes to His heart and cherishes.
Hebrews,12,7,You must submit to and endure [correction] for discipline; God is dealing with you as with sons. For what son is there whom his father does not [thus] train and correct and discipline?
Hebrews,12,8,Now if you are exempt from correction and left without discipline in which all [of God's children] share then you are illegitimate offspring and not true sons [at all].
Hebrews,12,9,Moreover we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we yielded [to them] and respected [them for training us]. Shall we not much more cheerfully submit to the Father of spirits and so [truly] live?
Hebrews,12,10,For [our earthly fathers] disciplined us for only a short period of time and chastised us as seemed proper and good to them; but He disciplines us for our certain good that we may become sharers in His own holiness.
Hebrews,12,11,For the time being no discipline brings joy but seems grievous and painful; but afterwards it yields a peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it [a harvest of fruit which consists in righteousness--in conformity to God's will in purpose thought and action resulting in right living and right standing with God].
Hebrews,12,12,So then brace up and reinvigorate and set right your slackened and weakened and drooping hands and strengthen your feeble and palsied and tottering knees
Hebrews,12,13,And cut through and make firm and plain and smooth straight paths for your feet [yes make them safe and upright and happy paths that go in the right direction] so that the lame and halting [limbs] may not be put out of joint but rather may be cured.
Hebrews,12,14,Strive to live in peace with everybody and pursue that consecration and holiness without which no one will [ever] see the Lord.
Hebrews,12,15,Exercise foresight and be on the watch to look [after one another] to see that no one falls back from and fails to secure God's grace (His unmerited favor and spiritual blessing) in order that no root of resentment (rancor bitterness or hatred) shoots forth and causes trouble and bitter torment and the many become contaminated and defiled by it--
Hebrews,12,16,That no one may become guilty of sexual vice or become a profane (godless and sacrilegious) person as Esau did who sold his own birthright for a single meal.
Hebrews,12,17,For you understand that later on when he wanted [to regain title to] his inheritance of the blessing he was rejected (disqualified and set aside) for he could find no opportunity to repair by repentance [what he had done no chance to recall the choice he had made] although he sought for it carefully with [bitter] tears.
Hebrews,12,18,For you have not come [as did the Israelites in the wilderness] to a [material] mountain that can be touched [a mountain] that is ablaze with fire and to gloom and darkness and a raging storm
Hebrews,12,19,And to the blast of a trumpet and a voice whose words make the listeners beg that nothing more be said to them.
Hebrews,12,20,For they could not bear the command that was given: If even a wild animal touches the mountain it shall be stoned to death.
Hebrews,12,21,In fact so awful and terrifying was the [phenomenal] sight that Moses said I am terrified (aghast and trembling with fear).
Hebrews,12,22,But rather you have come to Mount Zion even to the city of the living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to countless multitudes of angels in festal gathering
Hebrews,12,23,And to the church (assembly) of the Firstborn who are registered [as citizens] in heaven and to the God Who is Judge of all and to the spirits of the righteous (the redeemed in heaven) who have been made perfect
Hebrews,12,24,And to Jesus the Mediator (Go-between Agent) of a new covenant and to the sprinkled blood which speaks [of mercy] a better and nobler and more gracious message than the blood of Abel [which cried out for vengeance].
Hebrews,12,25,So see to it that you do not reject Him or refuse to listen to and heed Him Who is speaking [to you now]. For if they [the Israelites] did not escape when they refused to listen and heed Him Who warned and divinely instructed them [here] on earth [revealing with heavenly warnings His will] how much less shall we escape if we reject and turn our backs on Him Who cautions and admonishes [us] from heaven?
Hebrews,12,26,Then [at Mount Sinai] His voice shook the earth but now He has given a promise: Yet once more I will shake and make tremble not only the earth but also the [starry] heavens.
Hebrews,12,27,Now this expression Yet once more indicates the final removal and transformation of all [that can be] shaken--that is of that which has been created--in order that what cannot be shaken may remain and continue.
Hebrews,12,28,Let us therefore receiving a kingdom that is firm and stable and cannot be shaken offer to God pleasing service and acceptable worship with modesty and pious care and godly fear and awe;
Hebrews,12,29,For our God [is indeed] a consuming fire.
Hebrews,13,1,LET LOVE for your fellow believers continue and be a fixed practice with you [never let it fail].
Hebrews,13,2,Do not forget or neglect or refuse to extend hospitality to strangers [in the brotherhood--being friendly cordial and gracious sharing the comforts of your home and doing your part generously] for through it some have entertained angels without knowing it.
Hebrews,13,3,Remember those who are in prison as if you were their fellow prisoner and those who are ill-treated since you also are liable to bodily sufferings.
Hebrews,13,4,Let marriage be held in honor (esteemed worthy precious of great price and especially dear) in all things. And thus let the marriage bed be undefiled (kept undishonored); for God will judge and punish the unchaste [all guilty of sexual vice] and adulterous.
Hebrews,13,5,Let your character or moral disposition be free from love of money [including greed avarice lust and craving for earthly possessions] and be satisfied with your present [circumstances and with what you have]; for He [God] Himself has said I will not in any way fail you nor give you up nor leave you without support. [I will] not [I will] not [I will] not in any degree leave you helpless nor forsake nor let [you] down ( relax My hold on you)! [ Assuredly not!]
Hebrews,13,6,So we take comfort and are encouraged and confidently and boldly say The Lord is my Helper; I will not be seized with alarm [I will not fear or dread or be terrified]. What can man do to me?
Hebrews,13,7,Remember your leaders and superiors in authority [for it was they] who brought to you the Word of God. Observe attentively and consider their manner of living (the outcome of their well-spent lives) and imitate their faith ( their conviction that God exists and is the Creator and Ruler of all things the Provider and Bestower of eternal salvation through Christ and their leaning of the entire human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence in His power wisdom and goodness).
Hebrews,13,8,Jesus Christ (the Messiah) is [always] the same yesterday today [yes] and forever (to the ages).
Hebrews,13,9,Do not be carried about by different and varied and alien teachings; for it is good for the heart to be established and ennobled and strengthened by means of grace (God's favor and spiritual blessing) and not [to be devoted to] foods [rules of diet and ritualistic meals] which bring no [spiritual] benefit or profit to those who observe them.
Hebrews,13,10,We have an altar from which those who serve and worship in the tabernacle have no right to eat.
Hebrews,13,11,For when the blood of animals is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin the victims' bodies are burned outside the limits of the camp.
Hebrews,13,12,Therefore Jesus also suffered and died outside the [city's] gate in order that He might purify and consecrate the people through [the shedding of] His own blood and set them apart as holy [for God].
Hebrews,13,13,Let us then go forth [from all that would prevent us] to Him outside the camp [at Calvary] bearing the contempt and abuse and shame with Him.
Hebrews,13,14,For here we have no permanent city but we are looking for the one which is to come.
Hebrews,13,15,Through Him therefore let us constantly and at all times offer up to God a sacrifice of praise which is the fruit of lips that thankfully acknowledge and confess and glorify His name.
Hebrews,13,16,Do not forget or neglect to do kindness and good to be generous and distribute and contribute to the needy [of the church as embodiment and proof of fellowship] for such sacrifices are pleasing to God.
Hebrews,13,17,Obey your spiritual leaders and submit to them [continually recognizing their authority over you] for they are constantly keeping watch over your souls and guarding your spiritual welfare as men who will have to render an account [of their trust]. [Do your part to] let them do this with gladness and not with sighing and groaning for that would not be profitable to you [either].
Hebrews,13,18,Keep praying for us for we are convinced that we have a good (clear) conscience that we want to walk uprightly and live a noble life acting honorably and in complete honesty in all things.
Hebrews,13,19,And I beg of you [to pray for us] the more earnestly in order that I may be restored to you the sooner.
Hebrews,13,20,Now may the God of peace [Who is the Author and the Giver of peace] Who brought again from among the dead our Lord Jesus that great Shepherd of the sheep by the blood [that sealed ratified] the everlasting agreement (covenant testament)
Hebrews,13,21,Strengthen (complete perfect) and make you what you ought to be and equip you with everything good that you may carry out His will; [while He Himself] works in you and accomplishes that which is pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ (the Messiah); to Whom be the glory forever and ever (to the ages of the ages). Amen (so be it).
Hebrews,13,22,I call on you brethren to listen patiently and bear with this message of exhortation and admonition and encouragement for I have written to you briefly.
Hebrews,13,23,Notice that our brother Timothy has been released [from prison]. If he comes here soon I will see you along with him.
Hebrews,13,24,Give our greetings to all of your spiritual leaders and to all of the saints (God's consecrated believers). The Italian Christians send you their greetings [also].
Hebrews,13,25,Grace (God's favor and spiritual blessing) be with you all. Amen (so be it).
James,1,1,JAMES A servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ to the twelve tribes scattered abroad [among the Gentiles in the dispersion]: Greetings ( rejoice)!
James,1,2,Consider it wholly joyful my brethren whenever you are enveloped in or encounter trials of any sort or fall into various temptations.
James,1,3,Be assured and understand that the trial and proving of your faith bring out endurance and steadfastness and patience.
James,1,4,But let endurance and steadfastness and patience have full play and do a thorough work so that you may be [people] perfectly and fully developed [with no defects] lacking in nothing.
James,1,5,If any of you is deficient in wisdom let him ask of the giving God [Who gives] to everyone liberally and ungrudgingly without reproaching or faultfinding and it will be given him.
James,1,6,Only it must be in faith that he asks with no wavering (no hesitating no doubting). For the one who wavers (hesitates doubts) is like the billowing surge out at sea that is blown hither and thither and tossed by the wind.
James,1,7,For truly let not such a person imagine that he will receive anything [he asks for] from the Lord
James,1,8,[For being as he is] a man of two minds (hesitating dubious irresolute) [he is] unstable and unreliable and uncertain about everything [he thinks feels decides].
James,1,9,Let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his elevation [as a Christian called to the true riches and to be an heir of God]
James,1,10,And the rich [person ought to glory] in being humbled [by being shown his human frailty] because like the flower of the grass he will pass away.
James,1,11,For the sun comes up with a scorching heat and parches the grass; its flower falls off and its beauty fades away. Even so will the rich man wither and die in the midst of his pursuits.
James,1,12,Blessed (happy to be envied) is the man who is patient under trial and stands up under temptation for when he has stood the test and been approved he will receive [the victor's] crown of life which God has promised to those who love Him.
James,1,13,Let no one say when he is tempted I am tempted from God; for God is incapable of being tempted by [what is] evil and He Himself tempts no one.
James,1,14,But every person is tempted when he is drawn away enticed and baited by his own evil desire (lust passions).
James,1,15,Then the evil desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin and sin when it is fully matured brings forth death.
James,1,16,Do not be misled my beloved brethren.
James,1,17,Every good gift and every perfect ( free large full) gift is from above; it comes down from the Father of all [that gives] light in [the shining of] Whom there can be no variation [rising or setting] or shadow cast by His turning [as in an eclipse].
James,1,18,And it was of His own [free] will that He gave us birth [as sons] by [His] Word of Truth so that we should be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures [a sample of what He created to be consecrated to Himself].
James,1,19,Understand [this] my beloved brethren. Let every man be quick to hear [a ready listener] slow to speak slow to take offense and to get angry.
James,1,20,For man's anger does not promote the righteousness God [wishes and requires].
James,1,21,So get rid of all uncleanness and the rampant outgrowth of wickedness and in a humble (gentle modest) spirit receive and welcome the Word which implanted and rooted [in your hearts] contains the power to save your souls.
James,1,22,But be doers of the Word [obey the message] and not merely listeners to it betraying yourselves [into deception by reasoning contrary to the Truth].
James,1,23,For if anyone only listens to the Word without obeying it and being a doer of it he is like a man who looks carefully at his [own] natural face in a mirror;
James,1,24,For he thoughtfully observes himself and then goes off and promptly forgets what he was like.
James,1,25,But he who looks carefully into the faultless law the [law] of liberty and is faithful to it and perseveres in looking into it being not a heedless listener who forgets but an active doer [who obeys] he shall be blessed in his doing (his life of obedience).
James,1,26,If anyone thinks himself to be religious (piously observant of the external duties of his faith) and does not bridle his tongue but deludes his own heart this person's religious service is worthless (futile barren).
James,1,27,External religious worship [ religion as it is expressed in outward acts] that is pure and unblemished in the sight of God the Father is this: to visit and help and care for the orphans and widows in their affliction and need and to keep oneself unspotted and uncontaminated from the world.
James,2,1,MY BRETHREN pay no servile regard to people [show no prejudice no partiality]. Do not [attempt to] hold and practice the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ [the Lord] of glory [together with snobbery]!
James,2,2,For if a person comes into your congregation whose hands are adorned with gold rings and who is wearing splendid apparel and also a poor [man] in shabby clothes comes in
James,2,3,And you pay special attention to the one who wears the splendid clothes and say to him Sit here in this preferable seat! while you tell the poor [man] Stand there! or Sit there on the floor at my feet!
James,2,4,Are you not discriminating among your own and becoming critics and judges with wrong motives?
James,2,5,Listen my beloved brethren: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and in their position as believers and to inherit the kingdom which He has promised to those who love Him?
James,2,6,But you [in contrast] have insulted (humiliated dishonored and shown your contempt for) the poor. Is it not the rich who domineer over you? Is it not they who drag you into the law courts?
James,2,7,Is it not they who slander and blaspheme that precious name by which you are distinguished and called [the name of Christ invoked in baptism]?
James,2,8,If indeed you [really] fulfill the royal Law in accordance with the Scripture You shall love your neighbor as [you love] yourself you do well.
James,2,9,But if you show servile regard (prejudice favoritism) for people you commit sin and are rebuked and convicted by the Law as violators and offenders.
James,2,10,For whosoever keeps the Law [as a] whole but stumbles and offends in one [single instance] has become guilty of [breaking] all of it.
James,2,11,For He Who said You shall not commit adultery also said You shall not kill. If you do not commit adultery but do kill you have become guilty of transgressing the [whole] Law.
James,2,12,So speak and so act as [people should] who are to be judged under the law of liberty [the moral instruction given by Christ especially about love].
James,2,13,For to him who has shown no mercy the judgment [will be] merciless but mercy [full of glad confidence] exults victoriously over judgment.
James,2,14,What is the use (profit) my brethren for anyone to profess to have faith if he has no [good] works [to show for it]? Can [such] faith save [his soul]?
James,2,15,If a brother or sister is poorly clad and lacks food for each day
James,2,16,And one of you says to him Good-bye! Keep [yourself] warm and well fed without giving him the necessities for the body what good does that do?
James,2,17,So also faith if it does not have works (deeds and actions of obedience to back it up) by itself is destitute of power (inoperative dead).
James,2,18,But someone will say [to you then] You [say you] have faith and I have [good] works. Now you show me your [alleged] faith apart from any [good] works [if you can] and I by [good] works [of obedience] will show you my faith.
James,2,19,You believe that God is one; you do well. So do the demons believe and shudder [in terror and horror such as make a man's hair stand on end and contract the surface of his skin]!
James,2,20,Are you willing to be shown [proof] you foolish (unproductive spiritually deficient) fellow that faith apart from [good] works is inactive and ineffective and worthless?
James,2,21,Was not our forefather Abraham [shown to be] justified (made acceptable to God) by [his] works when he brought to the altar as an offering his [own] son Isaac?
James,2,22,You see that [his] faith was cooperating with his works and [his] faith was completed and reached its supreme expression [when he implemented it] by [good] works.
James,2,23,And [so] the Scripture was fulfilled that says Abraham believed in (adhered to trusted in and relied on) God and this was accounted to him as righteousness (as conformity to God's will in thought and deed) and he was called God's friend.
James,2,24,You see that a man is justified (pronounced righteous before God) through what he does and not alone through faith [through works of obedience as well as by what he believes].
James,2,25,So also with Rahab the harlot--was she not shown to be justified (pronounced righteous before God) by [good] deeds when she took in the scouts (spies) and sent them away by a different route?
James,2,26,For as the human body apart from the spirit is lifeless so faith apart from [its] works of obedience is also dead.
James,3,1,NOT MANY [of you] should become teachers ( self-constituted censors and reprovers of others) my brethren for you know that we [teachers] will be judged by a higher standard and with greater severity [than other people; thus we assume the greater accountability and the more condemnation].
James,3,2,For we all often stumble and fall and offend in many things. And if anyone does not offend in speech [never says the wrong things] he is a fully developed character and a perfect man able to control his whole body and to curb his entire nature.
James,3,3,If we set bits in the horses' mouths to make them obey us we can turn their whole bodies about.
James,3,4,Likewise look at the ships: though they are so great and are driven by rough winds they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the impulse of the helmsman determines.
James,3,5,Even so the tongue is a little member and it can boast of great things. See how much wood or how great a forest a tiny spark can set ablaze!
James,3,6,And the tongue is a fire. [The tongue is a] world of wickedness set among our members contaminating and depraving the whole body and setting on fire the wheel of birth (the cycle of man's nature) being itself ignited by hell (Gehenna).
James,3,7,For every kind of beast and bird of reptile and sea animal can be tamed and has been tamed by human genius (nature).
James,3,8,But the human tongue can be tamed by no man. It is a restless (undisciplined irreconcilable) evil full of deadly poison.
James,3,9,With it we bless the Lord and Father and with it we curse men who were made in God's likeness!
James,3,10,Out of the same mouth come forth blessing and cursing. These things my brethren ought not to be so.
James,3,11,Does a fountain send forth [simultaneously] from the same opening fresh water and bitter?
James,3,12,Can a fig tree my brethren bear olives or a grapevine figs? Neither can a salt spring furnish fresh water.
James,3,13,Who is there among you who is wise and intelligent? Then let him by his noble living show forth his [good] works with the [unobtrusive] humility [which is the proper attribute] of true wisdom.
James,3,14,But if you have bitter jealousy (envy) and contention (rivalry selfish ambition) in your hearts do not pride yourselves on it and thus be in defiance of and false to the Truth.
James,3,15,This [superficial] wisdom is not such as comes down from above but is earthly unspiritual (animal) even devilish (demoniacal).
James,3,16,For wherever there is jealousy (envy) and contention (rivalry and selfish ambition) there will also be confusion (unrest disharmony rebellion) and all sorts of evil and vile practices.
James,3,17,But the wisdom from above is first of all pure (undefiled); then it is peace-loving courteous (considerate gentle). [It is willing to] yield to reason full of compassion and good fruits; it is wholehearted and straightforward impartial and unfeigned (free from doubts wavering and insincerity).
James,3,18,And the harvest of righteousness (of conformity to God's will in thought and deed) is [the fruit of the seed] sown in peace by those who work for and make peace [in themselves and in others that peace which means concord agreement and harmony between individuals with undisturbedness in a peaceful mind free from fears and agitating passions and moral conflicts].
James,4,1,WHAT LEADS to strife (discord and feuds) and how do conflicts (quarrels and fightings) originate among you? Do they not arise from your sensual desires that are ever warring in your bodily members?
James,4,2,You are jealous and covet [what others have] and your desires go unfulfilled; [so] you become murderers. [To hate is to murder as far as your hearts are concerned.] You burn with envy and anger and are not able to obtain [the gratification the contentment and the happiness that you seek] so you fight and war. You do not have because you do not ask. [I John 3:15.]
James,4,3,[Or] you do ask [God for them] and yet fail to receive because you ask with wrong purpose and evil selfish motives. Your intention is [when you get what you desire] to spend it in sensual pleasures.
James,4,4,You [are like] unfaithful wives [having illicit love affairs with the world and breaking your marriage vow to God]! Do you not know that being the world's friend is being God's enemy? So whoever chooses to be a friend of the world takes his stand as an enemy of God.
James,4,5,Or do you suppose that the Scripture is speaking to no purpose that says The Spirit Whom He has caused to dwell in us yearns over us and He yearns for the Spirit [to be welcome] with a jealous love?
James,4,6,But He gives us more and more grace ( power of the Holy Spirit to meet this evil tendency and all others fully). That is why He says God sets Himself against the proud and haughty but gives grace [continually] to the lowly (those who are humble enough to receive it).
James,4,7,So be subject to God. Resist the devil [stand firm against him] and he will flee from you.
James,4,8,Come close to God and He will come close to you. [Recognize that you are] sinners get your soiled hands clean; [realize that you have been disloyal] wavering individuals with divided interests and purify your hearts [of your spiritual adultery].
James,4,9,[As you draw near to God] be deeply penitent and grieve even weep [over your disloyalty]. Let your laughter be turned to grief and your mirth to dejection and heartfelt shame [for your sins].
James,4,10,Humble yourselves [feeling very insignificant] in the presence of the Lord and He will exalt you [He will lift you up and make your lives significant].
James,4,11,[My] brethren do not speak evil about or accuse one another. He that maligns a brother or judges his brother is maligning and criticizing the Law and judging the Law. But if you judge the Law you are not a practicer of the Law but a censor and judge [of it].
James,4,12,One only is the Lawgiver and Judge Who is able to save and to destroy [the One Who has the absolute power of life and death]. [But you] who are you that [you presume to] pass judgment on your neighbor?
James,4,13,Come now you who say Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a city and spend a year there and carry on our business and make money.
James,4,14,Yet you do not know [the least thing] about what may happen tomorrow. What is the nature of your life? You are [really] but a wisp of vapor (a puff of smoke a mist) that is visible for a little while and then disappears [into thin air].
James,4,15,You ought instead to say If the Lord is willing we shall live and we shall do this or that [thing].
James,4,16,But as it is you boast [falsely] in your presumption and your self-conceit. All such boasting is wrong.
James,4,17,So any person who knows what is right to do but does not do it to him it is sin.
James,5,1,COME NOW you rich [people] weep aloud and lament over the miseries (the woes) that are surely coming upon you.
James,5,2,Your abundant wealth has rotted and is ruined and your [many] garments have become moth-eaten.
James,5,3,Your gold and silver are completely rusted through and their rust will be testimony against you and it will devour your flesh as if it were fire. You have heaped together treasure for the last days.
James,5,4,[But] look! [Here are] the wages that you have withheld by fraud from the laborers who have reaped your fields crying out [for vengeance]; and the cries of the harvesters have come to the ears of the Lord of hosts.
James,5,5,[Here] on earth you have abandoned yourselves to soft (prodigal) living and to [the pleasures of] self-indulgence and self-gratification. You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.
James,5,6,You have condemned and have murdered the righteous (innocent man) [while] he offers no resistance to you.
James,5,7,So be patient brethren [as you wait] till the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits expectantly for the precious harvest from the land. [See how] he keeps up his patient [vigil] over it until it receives the early and late rains.
James,5,8,So you also must be patient. Establish your hearts [strengthen and confirm them in the final certainty] for the coming of the Lord is very near.
James,5,9,Do not complain brethren against one another so that you [yourselves] may not be judged. Look! The Judge is [already] standing at the very door.
James,5,10,[As] an example of suffering and ill-treatment together with patience brethren take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord [as His messengers].
James,5,11,You know how we call those blessed (happy) who were steadfast [who endured]. You have heard of the endurance of Job and you have seen the Lord's [purpose and how He richly blessed him in the] end inasmuch as the Lord is full of pity and compassion and tenderness and mercy.
James,5,12,But above all [things] my brethren do not swear either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath; but let your yes be [a simple] yes and your no be [a simple] no so that you may not sin and fall under condemnation.
James,5,13,Is anyone among you afflicted (ill-treated suffering evil)? He should pray. Is anyone glad at heart? He should sing praise [to God].
James,5,14,Is anyone among you sick? He should call in the church elders (the spiritual guides). And they should pray over him anointing him with oil in the Lord's name.
James,5,15,And the prayer [that is] of faith will save him who is sick and the Lord will restore him; and if he has committed sins he will be forgiven.
James,5,16,Confess to one another therefore your faults (your slips your false steps your offenses your sins) and pray [also] for one another that you may be healed and restored [to a spiritual tone of mind and heart]. The earnest (heartfelt continued) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available [dynamic in its working].
James,5,17,Elijah was a human being with a nature such as we have [with feelings affections and a constitution like ours]; and he prayed earnestly for it not to rain and no rain fell on the earth for three years and six months. [I Kings 17:1.]
James,5,18,And [then] he prayed again and the heavens supplied rain and the land produced its crops [as usual]. [I Kings 18:42-45.]
James,5,19,[My] brethren if anyone among you strays from the Truth and falls into error and another [person] brings him back [to God]
James,5,20,Let the [latter] one be sure that whoever turns a sinner from his evil course will save [that one's] soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins [ procure the pardon of the many sins committed by the convert].
1 Peter,1,1,PETER AN apostle (a special messenger) of Jesus Christ [writing] to the elect exiles of the dispersion scattered (sowed) abroad in Pontus Galatia Cappadocia Asia and Bithynia
1 Peter,1,2,Who were chosen and foreknown by God the Father and consecrated (sanctified made holy) by the Spirit to be obedient to Jesus Christ (the Messiah) and to be sprinkled with [His] blood: May grace (spiritual blessing) and peace be given you in increasing abundance [that spiritual peace to be realized in and through Christ freedom from fears agitating passions and moral conflicts].
1 Peter,1,3,Praised (honored blessed) be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah)! By His boundless mercy we have been born again to an ever-living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead
1 Peter,1,4,[Born anew] into an inheritance which is beyond the reach of change and decay [imperishable] unsullied and unfading reserved in heaven for you
1 Peter,1,5,Who are being guarded (garrisoned) by God's power through [your] faith [till you fully inherit that final] salvation that is ready to be revealed [for you] in the last time.
1 Peter,1,6,[You should] be exceedingly glad on this account though now for a little while you may be distressed by trials and suffer temptations
1 Peter,1,7,So that [the genuineness] of your faith may be tested [your faith] which is infinitely more precious than the perishable gold which is tested and purified by fire. [This proving of your faith is intended] to redound to [your] praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One) is revealed.
1 Peter,1,8,Without having seen Him you love Him; though you do not [even] now see Him you believe in Him and exult and thrill with inexpressible and glorious (triumphant heavenly) joy.
1 Peter,1,9,[At the same time] you receive the result (outcome consummation) of your faith the salvation of your souls.
1 Peter,1,10,The prophets who prophesied of the grace (divine blessing) which was intended for you searched and inquired earnestly about this salvation.
1 Peter,1,11,They sought [to find out] to whom or when this was to come which the Spirit of Christ working within them was indicating when He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories that should follow [them].
1 Peter,1,12,It was then disclosed to them that the services they were rendering were not meant for themselves and their period of time but for you. [It is these very] things which have now already been made known plainly to you by those who preached the good news (the Gospel) to you by the [same] Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Into these things [the very] angels long to look!
1 Peter,1,13,So brace up your minds; be sober (circumspect morally alert); set your hope wholly and unchangeably on the grace (divine favor) that is coming to you when Jesus Christ (the Messiah) is revealed.
1 Peter,1,14,[Live] as children of obedience [to God]; do not conform yourselves to the evil desires [that governed you] in your former ignorance [when you did not know the requirements of the Gospel].
1 Peter,1,15,But as the One Who called you is holy you yourselves also be holy in all your conduct and manner of living.
1 Peter,1,16,For it is written You shall be holy for I am holy.
1 Peter,1,17,And if you call upon Him as [your] Father Who judges each one impartially according to what he does [then] you should conduct yourselves with true reverence throughout the time of your temporary residence [on the earth whether long or short].
1 Peter,1,18,You must know (recognize) that you were redeemed (ransomed) from the useless (fruitless) way of living inherited by tradition from [your] forefathers not with corruptible things [such as] silver and gold
1 Peter,1,19,But [you were purchased] with the precious blood of Christ (the Messiah) like that of a [sacrificial] lamb without blemish or spot.
1 Peter,1,20,It is true that He was chosen and foreordained (destined and foreknown for it) before the foundation of the world but He was brought out to public view (made manifest) in these last days (at the end of the times) for the sake of you.
1 Peter,1,21,Through Him you believe in (adhere to rely on) God Who raised Him up from the dead and gave Him honor and glory so that your faith and hope are [centered and rest] in God.
1 Peter,1,22,Since by your obedience to the Truth through the [Holy ] Spirit you have purified your hearts for the sincere affection of the brethren [see that you] love one another fervently from a pure heart.
1 Peter,1,23,You have been regenerated (born again) not from a mortal origin ( seed sperm) but from one that is immortal by the ever living and lasting Word of God.
1 Peter,1,24,For all flesh (mankind) is like grass and all its glory (honor) like [the] flower of grass. The grass withers and the flower drops off
1 Peter,1,25,But the Word of the Lord ( divine instruction the Gospel) endures forever. And this Word is the good news which was preached to you.
1 Peter,2,1,SO BE done with every trace of wickedness (depravity malignity) and all deceit and insincerity (pretense hypocrisy) and grudges (envy jealousy) and slander and evil speaking of every kind.
1 Peter,2,2,Like newborn babies you should crave (thirst for earnestly desire) the pure (unadulterated) spiritual milk that by it you may be nurtured and grow unto [completed] salvation
1 Peter,2,3,Since you have [already] tasted the goodness and kindness of the Lord.
1 Peter,2,4,Come to Him [then to that] Living Stone which men tried and threw away but which is chosen [and] precious in God's sight.
1 Peter,2,5,[Come] and like living stones be yourselves built [into] a spiritual house for a holy (dedicated consecrated) priesthood to offer up [those] spiritual sacrifices [that are] acceptable and pleasing to God through Jesus Christ.
1 Peter,2,6,For thus it stands in Scripture: Behold I am laying in Zion a chosen ( honored) precious chief Cornerstone and he who believes in Him [who adheres to trusts in and relies on Him] shall never be disappointed or put to shame.
1 Peter,2,7,To you then who believe (who adhere to trust in and rely on Him) is the preciousness; but for those who disbelieve [it is true] The [very] Stone which the builders rejected has become the main Cornerstone
1 Peter,2,8,And A Stone that will cause stumbling and a Rock that will give [men] offense; they stumble because they disobey and disbelieve [God's] Word as those [who reject Him] were destined (appointed) to do.
1 Peter,2,9,But you are a chosen race a royal priesthood a dedicated nation [God's] own purchased special people that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him Who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.
1 Peter,2,10,Once you were not a people [at all] but now you are God's people; once you were unpitied but now you are pitied and have received mercy.
1 Peter,2,11,Beloved I implore you as aliens and strangers and exiles [in this world] to abstain from the sensual urges (the evil desires the passions of the flesh your lower nature) that wage war against the soul.
1 Peter,2,12,Conduct yourselves properly (honorably righteously) among the Gentiles so that although they may slander you as evildoers [yet] they may by witnessing your good deeds [come to] glorify God in the day of inspection [ when God shall look upon you wanderers as a pastor or shepherd looks over his flock].
1 Peter,2,13,Be submissive to every human institution and authority for the sake of the Lord whether it be to the emperor as supreme
1 Peter,2,14,Or to governors as sent by him to bring vengeance (punishment justice) to those who do wrong and to encourage those who do good service.
1 Peter,2,15,For it is God's will and intention that by doing right [your good and honest lives] should silence (muzzle gag) the ignorant charges and ill-informed criticisms of foolish persons.
1 Peter,2,16,[Live] as free people [yet] without employing your freedom as a pretext for wickedness; but [live at all times] as servants of God.
1 Peter,2,17,Show respect for all men [treat them honorably]. Love the brotherhood (the Christian fraternity of which Christ is the Head). Reverence God. Honor the emperor.
1 Peter,2,18,[You who are] household servants be submissive to your masters with all [proper] respect not only to those who are kind and considerate and reasonable but also to those who are surly (overbearing unjust and crooked).
1 Peter,2,19,For one is regarded favorably (is approved acceptable and thankworthy) if as in the sight of God he endures the pain of unjust suffering.
1 Peter,2,20,[After all] what kind of glory [is there in it] if when you do wrong and are punished for it you take it patiently? But if you bear patiently with suffering [which results] when you do right and that is undeserved it is acceptable and pleasing to God.
1 Peter,2,21,For even to this were you called [it is inseparable from your vocation]. For Christ also suffered for you leaving you [His personal] example so that you should follow in His footsteps.
1 Peter,2,22,He was guilty of no sin neither was deceit (guile) ever found on His lips.
1 Peter,2,23,When He was reviled and insulted He did not revile or offer insult in return; [when] He was abused and suffered He made no threats [of vengeance]; but he trusted [Himself and everything] to Him Who judges fairly.
1 Peter,2,24,He personally bore our sins in His [own] body on the tree [as on an altar and offered Himself on it] that we might die (cease to exist) to sin and live to righteousness. By His wounds you have been healed.
1 Peter,2,25,For you were going astray like [so many] sheep but now you have come back to the Shepherd and Guardian ( the Bishop) of your souls.
1 Peter,3,1,IN LIKE manner you married women be submissive to your own husbands [subordinate yourselves as being secondary to and dependent on them and adapt yourselves to them] so that even if any do not obey the Word [of God] they may be won over not by discussion but by the [godly] lives of their wives
1 Peter,3,2,When they observe the pure and modest way in which you conduct yourselves together with your reverence [for your husband; you are to feel for him all that reverence includes: to respect defer to revere him--to honor esteem appreciate prize and in the human sense to adore him that is to admire praise be devoted to deeply love and enjoy your husband].
1 Peter,3,3,Let not yours be the [merely] external adorning with [elaborate] interweaving and knotting of the hair the wearing of jewelry or changes of clothes;
1 Peter,3,4,But let it be the inward adorning and beauty of the hidden person of the heart with the incorruptible and unfading charm of a gentle and peaceful spirit which [is not anxious or wrought up but] is very precious in the sight of God.
1 Peter,3,5,For it was thus that the pious women of old who hoped in God were [accustomed] to beautify themselves and were submissive to their husbands [adapting themselves to them as themselves secondary and dependent upon them].
1 Peter,3,6,It was thus that Sarah obeyed Abraham [following his guidance and acknowledging his headship over her by] calling him lord (master leader authority). And you are now her true daughters if you do right and let nothing terrify you [not giving way to hysterical fears or letting anxieties unnerve you].
1 Peter,3,7,In the same way you married men should live considerately with [your wives] with an intelligent recognition [of the marriage relation] honoring the woman as [physically] the weaker but [realizing that you] are joint heirs of the grace (God's unmerited favor) of life in order that your prayers may not be hindered and cut off. [Otherwise you cannot pray effectively.]
1 Peter,3,8,Finally all [of you] should be of one and the same mind (united in spirit) sympathizing [with one another] loving [each other] as brethren [of one household] compassionate and courteous (tenderhearted and humble).
1 Peter,3,9,Never return evil for evil or insult for insult (scolding tongue-lashing berating) but on the contrary blessing [praying for their welfare happiness and protection and truly pitying and loving them]. For know that to this you have been called that you may yourselves inherit a blessing [from God--that you may obtain a blessing as heirs bringing welfare and happiness and protection].
1 Peter,3,10,For let him who wants to enjoy life and see good days [good--whether apparent or not] keep his tongue free from evil and his lips from guile (treachery deceit).
1 Peter,3,11,Let him turn away from wickedness and shun it and let him do right. Let him search for peace (harmony; undisturbedness from fears agitating passions and moral conflicts) and seek it eagerly. [Do not merely desire peaceful relations with God with your fellowmen and with yourself but pursue go after them!]
1 Peter,3,12,For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous (those who are upright and in right standing with God) and His ears are attentive to their prayer. But the face of the Lord is against those who practice evil [to oppose them to frustrate and defeat them].
1 Peter,3,13,Now who is there to hurt you if you are zealous followers of that which is good?
1 Peter,3,14,But even in case you should suffer for the sake of righteousness [you are] blessed (happy to be envied). Do not dread or be afraid of their threats nor be disturbed [by their opposition].
1 Peter,3,15,But in your hearts set Christ apart as holy [and acknowledge Him] as Lord. Always be ready to give a logical defense to anyone who asks you to account for the hope that is in you but do it courteously and respectfully.
1 Peter,3,16,[And see to it that] your conscience is entirely clear ( unimpaired) so that when you are falsely accused as evildoers those who threaten you abusively and revile your right behavior in Christ may come to be ashamed [of slandering your good lives].
1 Peter,3,17,For [it is] better to suffer [unjustly] for doing right if that should be God's will than to suffer [justly] for doing wrong.
1 Peter,3,18,For Christ [the Messiah Himself] died for sins once for all the Righteous for the unrighteous (the Just for the unjust the Innocent for the guilty) that He might bring us to God. In His human body He was put to death but He was made alive in the spirit
1 Peter,3,19,In which He went and preached to the spirits in prison
1 Peter,3,20,[The souls of those] who long before in the days of Noah had been disobedient when God's patience waited during the building of the ark in which a few [people] actually eight in number were saved through water.
1 Peter,3,21,And baptism which is a figure [of their deliverance] does now also save you [from inward questionings and fears] not by the removing of outward body filth [bathing] but by [providing you with] the answer of a good and clear conscience (inward cleanness and peace) before God [because you are demonstrating what you believe to be yours] through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
1 Peter,3,22,[And He] has now entered into heaven and is at the right hand of God with [all] angels and authorities and powers made subservient to Him.
1 Peter,4,1,SO SINCE Christ suffered in the flesh for us for you arm yourselves with the same thought and purpose [patiently to suffer rather than fail to please God]. For whoever has suffered in the flesh [having the mind of Christ] is done with [intentional] sin [has stopped pleasing himself and the world and pleases God]
1 Peter,4,2,So that he can no longer spend the rest of his natural life living by [his] human appetites and desires but [he lives] for what God wills.
1 Peter,4,3,For the time that is past already suffices for doing what the Gentiles like to do--living [as you have done] in shameless insolent wantonness in lustful desires drunkenness reveling drinking bouts and abominable lawless idolatries.
1 Peter,4,4,They are astonished and think it very queer that you do not now run hand in hand with them in the same excesses of dissipation and they abuse [you].
1 Peter,4,5,But they will have to give an account to Him Who is ready to judge and pass sentence on the living and the dead.
1 Peter,4,6,For this is why the good news (the Gospel) was preached [ in their lifetime] even to the dead that though judged in fleshly bodies as men are they might live in the spirit as God does.
1 Peter,4,7,But the end and culmination of all things has now come near; keep sound minded and self-restrained and alert therefore for [the practice of] prayer.
1 Peter,4,8,Above all things have intense and unfailing love for one another for love covers a multitude of sins [forgives and disregards the offenses of others].
1 Peter,4,9,Practice hospitality to one another (those of the household of faith). [Be hospitable be a lover of strangers with brotherly affection for the unknown guests the foreigners the poor and all others who come your way who are of Christ's body.] And [in each instance] do it ungrudgingly (cordially and graciously without complaining but as representing Him).
1 Peter,4,10,As each of you has received a gift (a particular spiritual talent a gracious divine endowment) employ it for one another as [befits] good trustees of God's many-sided grace [faithful stewards of the extremely diverse powers and gifts granted to Christians by unmerited favor].
1 Peter,4,11,Whoever speaks [let him do it as one who utters] oracles of God; whoever renders service [let him do it] as with the strength which God furnishes abundantly so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ (the Messiah). To Him be the glory and dominion forever and ever (through endless ages). Amen (so be it).
1 Peter,4,12,Beloved do not be amazed and bewildered at the fiery ordeal which is taking place to test your quality as though something strange (unusual and alien to you and your position) were befalling you.
1 Peter,4,13,But insofar as you are sharing Christ's sufferings rejoice so that when His glory [full of radiance and splendor] is revealed you may also rejoice with triumph [exultantly].
1 Peter,4,14,If you are censured and suffer abuse [because you bear] the name of Christ blessed [are you--happy fortunate to be envied with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation regardless of your outward condition] because the Spirit of glory the Spirit of God is resting upon you. On their part He is blasphemed but on your part He is glorified.
1 Peter,4,15,But let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or any sort of criminal or as a mischief-maker (a meddler) in the affairs of others [infringing on their rights].
1 Peter,4,16,But if [one is ill-treated and suffers] as a Christian [which he is contemptuously called] let him not be ashamed but give glory to God that he is [deemed worthy to suffer] in this name.
1 Peter,4,17,For the time [has arrived] for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if it begins with us what will [be] the end of those who do not respect or believe or obey the good news (the Gospel) of God?
1 Peter,4,18,And if the righteous are barely saved what will become of the godless and wicked?
1 Peter,4,19,Therefore those who are ill-treated and suffer in accordance with God's will must do right and commit their souls [in charge as a deposit] to the One Who created [them] and will never fail [them].
1 Peter,5,1,I WARN and counsel the elders among you (the pastors and spiritual guides of the church) as a fellow elder and as an eyewitness [called to testify] of the sufferings of Christ as well as a sharer in the glory (the honor and splendor) that is to be revealed (disclosed unfolded):
1 Peter,5,2,Tend (nurture guard guide and fold) the flock of God that is [your responsibility] not by coercion or constraint but willingly; not dishonorably motivated by the advantages and profits [belonging to the office] but eagerly and cheerfully;
1 Peter,5,3,Not domineering [as arrogant dictatorial and overbearing persons] over those in your charge but being examples (patterns and models of Christian living) to the flock (the congregation).
1 Peter,5,4,And [then] when the Chief Shepherd is revealed you will win the conqueror's crown of glory.
1 Peter,5,5,Likewise you who are younger and of lesser rank be subject to the elders (the ministers and spiritual guides of the church)--[giving them due respect and yielding to their counsel]. Clothe (apron) yourselves all of you with humility [as the garb of a servant so that its covering cannot possibly be stripped from you with freedom from pride and arrogance] toward one another. For God sets Himself against the proud (the insolent the overbearing the disdainful the presumptuous the boastful)--[and He opposes frustrates and defeats them] but gives grace (favor blessing) to the humble.
1 Peter,5,6,Therefore humble yourselves [demote lower yourselves in your own estimation] under the mighty hand of God that in due time He may exalt you
1 Peter,5,7,Casting the whole of your care [all your anxieties all your worries all your concerns once and for all] on Him for He cares for you affectionately and cares about you watchfully.
1 Peter,5,8,Be well balanced (temperate sober of mind) be vigilant and cautious at all times; for that enemy of yours the devil roams around like a lion roaring [ in fierce hunger] seeking someone to seize upon and devour.
1 Peter,5,9,Withstand him; be firm in faith [against his onset--rooted established strong immovable and determined] knowing that the same ( identical) sufferings are appointed to your brotherhood (the whole body of Christians) throughout the world.
1 Peter,5,10,And after you have suffered a little while the God of all grace [Who imparts all blessing and favor] Who has called you to His [own] eternal glory in Christ Jesus will Himself complete and make you what you ought to be establish and ground you securely and strengthen and settle you.
1 Peter,5,11,To Him be the dominion (power authority rule) forever and ever. Amen (so be it).
1 Peter,5,12,By Silvanus a true (loyal consistent incorruptible) brother as I consider him I have written briefly to you to counsel and urge and stimulate [you] and to declare [to you] that this is the true [account of the] grace (the undeserved favor) of God. Be steadfast and persevere in it.
1 Peter,5,13,She [your sister church here] in Babylon [who is] elect (chosen) with [yourselves] sends you greetings and [so does] my son (disciple) Mark.
1 Peter,5,14,Salute one another with a kiss of love [the symbol of mutual affection]. To all of you that are in Christ Jesus (the Messiah) may there be peace ( every kind of peace and blessing especially peace with God and freedom from fears agitating passions and moral conflicts). Amen (so be it).
2 Peter,1,1,SIMON PETER a servant and apostle (special messenger) of Jesus Christ to those who have received (obtained an equal privilege of) like precious faith with ourselves in and through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ:
2 Peter,1,2,May grace (God's favor) and peace (which is perfect well-being all necessary good all spiritual prosperity and freedom from fears and agitating passions and moral conflicts) be multiplied to you in [the full personal precise and correct] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
2 Peter,1,3,For His divine power has bestowed upon us all things that [are requisite and suited] to life and godliness through the [ full personal] knowledge of Him Who called us by and to His own glory and excellence (virtue).
2 Peter,1,4,By means of these He has bestowed on us His precious and exceedingly great promises so that through them you may escape [by flight] from the moral decay (rottenness and corruption) that is in the world because of covetousness (lust and greed) and become sharers (partakers) of the divine nature.
2 Peter,1,5,For this very reason adding your diligence [to the divine promises] employ every effort in exercising your faith to develop virtue (excellence resolution Christian energy) and in [exercising] virtue [develop] knowledge (intelligence)
2 Peter,1,6,And in [exercising] knowledge [develop] self-control and in [exercising] self-control [develop] steadfastness (patience endurance) and in [exercising] steadfastness [develop] godliness (piety)
2 Peter,1,7,And in [exercising] godliness [develop] brotherly affection and in [exercising] brotherly affection [develop] Christian love.
2 Peter,1,8,For as these qualities are yours and increasingly abound in you they will keep [you] from being idle or unfruitful unto the [ full personal] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One).
2 Peter,1,9,For whoever lacks these qualities is blind [ spiritually] shortsighted seeing only what is near to him and has become oblivious [to the fact] that he was cleansed from his old sins.
2 Peter,1,10,Because of this brethren be all the more solicitous and eager to make sure (to ratify to strengthen to make steadfast) your calling and election; for if you do this you will never stumble or fall.
2 Peter,1,11,Thus there will be richly and abundantly provided for you entry into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
2 Peter,1,12,So I intend always to remind you about these things although indeed you know them and are firm in the truth that [you] now [hold].
2 Peter,1,13,I think it right as long as I am in this tabernacle (tent body) to stir you up by way of remembrance
2 Peter,1,14,Since I know that the laying aside of this body of mine will come speedily as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.
2 Peter,1,15,Moreover I will diligently endeavor [to see to it] that [even] after my departure (decease) you may be able at all times to call these things to mind.
2 Peter,1,16,For we were not following cleverly devised stories when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty (grandeur authority of sovereign power).
2 Peter,1,17,For when He was invested with honor and glory from God the Father and a voice was borne to Him by the [splendid] Majestic Glory [in the bright cloud that overshadowed Him saying] This is My beloved Son in Whom I am well pleased and delight
2 Peter,1,18,We [actually] heard this voice borne out of heaven for we were together with Him on the holy mountain.
2 Peter,1,19,And we have the prophetic word [made] firmer still. You will do well to pay close attention to it as to a lamp shining in a dismal (squalid and dark) place until the day breaks through [the gloom] and the Morning Star rises ( comes into being) in your hearts.
2 Peter,1,20,[Yet] first [you must] understand this that no prophecy of Scripture is [a matter] of any personal or private or special interpretation (loosening solving).
2 Peter,1,21,For no prophecy ever originated because some man willed it [to do so--it never came by human impulse] but men spoke from God who were borne along (moved and impelled) by the Holy Spirit.
2 Peter,2,1,BUT ALSO [in those days] there arose false prophets among the people just as there will be false teachers among yourselves who will subtly and stealthily introduce heretical doctrines (destructive heresies) even denying and disowning the Master Who bought them bringing upon themselves swift destruction.
2 Peter,2,2,And many will follow their immoral ways and lascivious doings; because of them the true Way will be maligned and defamed.
2 Peter,2,3,And in their covetousness (lust greed) they will exploit you with false (cunning) arguments. From of old the sentence [of condemnation] for them has not been idle; their destruction (eternal misery) has not been asleep.
2 Peter,2,4,For God did not [even] spare angels that sinned but cast them into hell delivering them to be kept there in pits of gloom till the judgment and their doom.
2 Peter,2,5,And He spared not the ancient world but preserved Noah a preacher of righteousness with seven other persons when He brought a flood upon the world of ungodly [people].
2 Peter,2,6,And He condemned to ruin and extinction the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah reducing them to ashes [and thus] set them forth as an example to those who would be ungodly;
2 Peter,2,7,And He rescued righteous Lot greatly worn out and distressed by the wanton ways of the ungodly and lawless--
2 Peter,2,8,For that just man living [there] among them tortured his righteous soul every day with what he saw and heard of [their] unlawful and wicked deeds--
2 Peter,2,9,Now if [all these things are true then be sure] the Lord knows how to rescue the godly out of temptations and trials and how to keep the ungodly under chastisement until the day of judgment and doom
2 Peter,2,10,And particularly those who walk after the flesh and indulge in the lust of polluting passion and scorn and despise authority. Presumptuous [and] daring [self-willed and self-loving creatures]! They scoff at and revile dignitaries (glorious ones) without trembling
2 Peter,2,11,Whereas [even] angels though superior in might and power do not bring a defaming charge against them before the Lord.
2 Peter,2,12,But these [people]! Like unreasoning beasts mere creatures of instinct born [only] to be captured and destroyed railing at things of which they are ignorant they shall utterly perish in their [own] corruption [in their destroying they shall surely be destroyed]
2 Peter,2,13,Being destined to receive [punishment as] the reward of [their] unrighteousness [suffering wrong as the hire for their wrongdoing]. They count it a delight to revel in the daytime [living luxuriously and delicately]. They are blots and blemishes reveling in their deceptions and carousing together [even] as they feast with you.
2 Peter,2,14,They have eyes full of harlotry insatiable for sin. They beguile and bait and lure away unstable souls. Their hearts are trained in covetousness (lust greed) [they are] children of a curse [ exposed to cursing]!
2 Peter,2,15,Forsaking the straight road they have gone astray; they have followed the way of Balaam [the son] of Beor who loved the reward of wickedness.
2 Peter,2,16,But he was rebuked for his own transgression when a dumb beast of burden spoke with human voice and checked the prophet's madness.
2 Peter,2,17,These are springs without water and mists driven along before a tempest for whom is reserved forever the gloom of darkness.
2 Peter,2,18,For uttering loud boasts of folly they beguile and lure with lustful desires of the flesh those who are barely escaping from them who are wrongdoers.
2 Peter,2,19,They promise them liberty when they themselves are the slaves of depravity and defilement--for by whatever anyone is made inferior or worse or is overcome to that [person or thing] he is enslaved.
2 Peter,2,20,For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through [the full personal] knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ they again become entangled in them and are overcome their last condition is worse [for them] than the first.
2 Peter,2,21,For never to have obtained a [full personal] knowledge of the way of righteousness would have been better for them than having obtained [such knowledge] to turn back from the holy commandment which was [verbally] delivered to them.
2 Peter,2,22,There has befallen them the thing spoken of in the true proverb The dog turns back to his own vomit and The sow is washed only to wallow again in the mire.
2 Peter,3,1,BELOVED I am now writing you this second letter. In [both of] them I have stirred up your unsullied (sincere) mind by way of remembrance
2 Peter,3,2,That you should recall the predictions of the holy (consecrated dedicated) prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior [given] through your apostles (His special messengers).
2 Peter,3,3,To begin with you must know and understand this that scoffers (mockers) will come in the last days with scoffing [people who] walk after their own fleshly desires
2 Peter,3,4,And say Where is the promise of His coming? For since the forefathers fell asleep all things have continued exactly as they did from the beginning of creation.
2 Peter,3,5,For they willfully overlook and forget this [fact] that the heavens [came into] existence long ago by the word of God and the earth also which was formed out of water and by means of water
2 Peter,3,6,Through which the world that then [existed] was deluged with water and perished.
2 Peter,3,7,But by the same word the present heavens and earth have been stored up (reserved) for fire being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly people.
2 Peter,3,8,Nevertheless do not let this one fact escape you beloved that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day.
2 Peter,3,9,The Lord does not delay and is not tardy or slow about what He promises according to some people's conception of slowness but He is long-suffering (extraordinarily patient) toward you not desiring that any should perish but that all should turn to repentance.
2 Peter,3,10,But the day of the Lord will come like a thief and then the heavens will vanish (pass away) with a thunderous crash and the [ material] elements [of the universe] will be dissolved with fire and the earth and the works that are upon it will be burned up.
2 Peter,3,11,Since all these things are thus in the process of being dissolved what kind of person ought [each of] you to be [in the meanwhile] in consecrated and holy behavior and devout and godly qualities
2 Peter,3,12,While you wait and earnestly long for (expect and hasten) the coming of the day of God by reason of which the flaming heavens will be dissolved and the [ material] elements [of the universe] will flare and melt with fire?
2 Peter,3,13,But we look for new heavens and a new earth according to His promise in which righteousness (uprightness freedom from sin and right standing with God) is to abide.
2 Peter,3,14,So beloved since you are expecting these things be eager to be found by Him [at His coming] without spot or blemish and at peace [in serene confidence free from fears and agitating passions and moral conflicts].
2 Peter,3,15,And consider that the long-suffering of our Lord [ His slowness in avenging wrongs and judging the world] is salvation ( that which is conducive to the soul's safety) even as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the spiritual insight given him
2 Peter,3,16,Speaking of this as he does in all of his letters. There are some things in those [epistles of Paul] that are difficult to understand which the ignorant and unstable twist and misconstrue to their own utter destruction just as [they distort and misinterpret] the rest of the Scriptures.
2 Peter,3,17,Let me warn you therefore beloved that knowing these things beforehand you should be on your guard lest you be carried away by the error of lawless and wicked [persons and] fall from your own [present] firm condition [your own steadfastness of mind].
2 Peter,3,18,But grow in grace (undeserved favor spiritual strength) and recognition and knowledge and understanding of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (the Messiah). To Him [be] glory (honor majesty and splendor) both now and to the day of eternity. Amen (so be it)!
1 John,1,1,[WE ARE writing] about the Word of Life [ in] Him Who existed from the beginning Whom we have heard Whom we have seen with our [own] eyes Whom we have gazed upon [for ourselves] and have touched with our [own] hands.
1 John,1,2,And the Life [ an aspect of His being] was revealed (made manifest demonstrated) and we saw [as eyewitnesses] and are testifying to and declare to you the Life the eternal Life [ in Him] Who already existed with the Father and Who [actually] was made visible (was revealed) to us [His followers].
1 John,1,3,What we have seen and [ourselves] heard we are also telling you so that you too may realize and enjoy fellowship as partners and partakers with us. And [this] fellowship that we have [which is a distinguishing mark of Christians] is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ (the Messiah).
1 John,1,4,And we are now writing these things to you so that our joy [in seeing you included] may be full [and your joy may be complete].
1 John,1,5,And this is the message [the message of promise] which we have heard from Him and now are reporting to you: God is Light and there is no darkness in Him at all [ no not in any way].
1 John,1,6,[So] if we say we are partakers together and enjoy fellowship with Him when we live and move and are walking about in darkness we are [both] speaking falsely and do not live and practice the Truth [which the Gospel presents].
1 John,1,7,But if we [really] are living and walking in the Light as He [Himself] is in the Light we have [true unbroken] fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses (removes) us from all sin and guilt [keeps us cleansed from sin in all its forms and manifestations].
1 John,1,8,If we say we have no sin [refusing to admit that we are sinners] we delude and lead ourselves astray and the Truth [which the Gospel presents] is not in us [does not dwell in our hearts].
1 John,1,9,If we [freely] admit that we have sinned and confess our sins He is faithful and just (true to His own nature and promises) and will forgive our sins [dismiss our lawlessness] and [continuously] cleanse us from all unrighteousness [everything not in conformity to His will in purpose thought and action].
1 John,1,10,If we say (claim) we have not sinned we contradict His Word and make Him out to be false and a liar and His Word is not in us [the divine message of the Gospel is not in our hearts].
1 John,2,1,MY LITTLE children I write you these things so that you may not violate God's law and sin. But if anyone should sin we have an Advocate (One Who will intercede for us) with the Father--[it is] Jesus Christ [the all] righteous [upright just Who conforms to the Father's will in every purpose thought and action].
1 John,2,2,And He [ that same Jesus Himself] is the propitiation (the atoning sacrifice) for our sins and not for ours alone but also for [the sins of] the whole world.
1 John,2,3,And this is how we may discern [ daily by experience] that we are coming to know Him [to perceive recognize understand and become better acquainted with Him]: if we keep (bear in mind observe practice) His teachings (precepts commandments).
1 John,2,4,Whoever says I know Him [I perceive recognize understand and am acquainted with Him] but fails to keep and obey His commandments (teachings) is a liar and the Truth [ of the Gospel] is not in him.
1 John,2,5,But he who keeps (treasures) His Word [who bears in mind His precepts who observes His message in its entirety] truly in him has the love of and for God been perfected (completed reached maturity). By this we may perceive (know recognize and be sure) that we are in Him:
1 John,2,6,Whoever says he abides in Him ought [as a personal debt] to walk and conduct himself in the same way in which He walked and conducted Himself.
1 John,2,7,Beloved I am writing you no new commandment but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the message which you have heard [the doctrine of salvation through Christ].
1 John,2,8,Yet I am writing you a new commandment which is true (is realized) in Him and in you because the darkness ( moral blindness) is clearing away and the true Light ( the revelation of God in Christ) is already shining.
1 John,2,9,Whoever says he is in the Light and [yet] hates his brother [Christian born-again child of God his Father] is in darkness even until now.
1 John,2,10,Whoever loves his brother [believer] abides (lives) in the Light and in It or in him there is no occasion for stumbling or cause for error or sin.
1 John,2,11,But he who hates (detests despises) his brother [ in Christ] is in darkness and walking (living) in the dark; he is straying and does not perceive or know where he is going because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
1 John,2,12,I am writing to you little children because for His name's sake your sins are forgiven [pardoned through His name and on account of confessing His name].
1 John,2,13,I am writing to you fathers because you have come to know (recognize be aware of and understand) Him Who [has existed] from the beginning. I am writing to you young men because you have been victorious over the wicked [one]. I write to you boys (lads) because you have come to know (recognize and be aware) of the Father.
1 John,2,14,I write to you fathers because you have come to know (recognize be conscious of and understand) Him Who [has existed] from the beginning. I write to you young men because you are strong and vigorous and the Word of God is [always] abiding in you (in your hearts) and you have been victorious over the wicked one.
1 John,2,15,Do not love or cherish the world or the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world love for the Father is not in him.
1 John,2,16,For all that is in the world--the lust of the flesh [craving for sensual gratification] and the lust of the eyes [greedy longings of the mind] and the pride of life [assurance in one's own resources or in the stability of earthly things]--these do not come from the Father but are from the world [itself].
1 John,2,17,And the world passes away and disappears and with it the forbidden cravings (the passionate desires the lust) of it; but he who does the will of God and carries out His purposes in his life abides (remains) forever.
1 John,2,18,Boys (lads) it is the last time (hour the end of this age). And as you have heard that the antichrist [he who will oppose Christ in the guise of Christ] is coming even now many antichrists have arisen which confirms our belief that it is the final (the end) time.
1 John,2,19,They went out from our number but they did not [really] belong to us; for if they had been of us they would have remained with us. But [they withdrew] that it might be plain that they all are not of us.
1 John,2,20,But you have been anointed by [you hold a sacred appointment from you have been given an unction from] the Holy One and you all know [the Truth] or you know all things.
1 John,2,21,I write to you not because you are ignorant and do not perceive and know the Truth but because you do perceive and know it and [know positively] that nothing false (no deception no lie) is of the Truth.
1 John,2,22,Who is [such a] liar as he who denies that Jesus is the Christ (the Messiah)? He is the antichrist (the antagonist of Christ) who [ habitually] denies and refuses to acknowledge the Father and the Son.
1 John,2,23,No one who [ habitually] denies (disowns) the Son even has the Father. Whoever confesses (acknowledges and has) the Son has the Father also.
1 John,2,24,As for you keep in your hearts what you have heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the first dwells and remains in you then you will dwell in the Son and in the Father [always].
1 John,2,25,And this is what He Himself has promised us--the life the eternal [life].
1 John,2,26,I write this to you with reference to those who would deceive you [seduce and lead you astray].
1 John,2,27,But as for you the anointing (the sacred appointment the unction) which you received from Him abides [ permanently] in you; [so] then you have no need that anyone should instruct you. But just as His anointing teaches you concerning everything and is true and is no falsehood so you must abide in (live in never depart from) Him [being rooted in Him knit to Him] just as [His anointing] has taught you [to do].
1 John,2,28,And now little children abide (live remain permanently) in Him so that when He is made visible we may have and enjoy perfect confidence (boldness assurance) and not be ashamed and shrink from Him at His coming.
1 John,2,29,If you know (perceive and are sure) that He [Christ] is [absolutely] righteous [conforming to the Father's will in purpose thought and action] you may also know (be sure) that everyone who does righteously [and is therefore in like manner conformed to the divine will] is born (begotten) of Him [ God].
1 John,3,1,SEE WHAT [ an incredible] quality of love the Father has given (shown bestowed on) us that we should [be permitted to] be named and called and counted the children of God! And so we are! The reason that the world does not know (recognize acknowledge) us is that it does not know (recognize acknowledge) Him.
1 John,3,2,Beloved we are [even here and] now God's children; it is not yet disclosed (made clear) what we shall be [hereafter] but we know that when He comes and is manifested we shall [ as God's children] resemble and be like Him for we shall see Him just as He [really] is.
1 John,3,3,And everyone who has this hope [resting] on Him cleanses (purifies) himself just as He is pure (chaste undefiled guiltless).
1 John,3,4,Everyone who commits (practices) sin is guilty of lawlessness; for [that is what] sin is lawlessness (the breaking violating of God's law by transgression or neglect--being unrestrained and unregulated by His commands and His will).
1 John,3,5,You know that He appeared in visible form and became Man to take away [upon Himself] sins and in Him there is no sin [ essentially and forever].
1 John,3,6,No one who abides in Him [who lives and remains in communion with and in obedience to Him--deliberately knowingly and habitually] commits (practices) sin. No one who [habitually] sins has either seen or known Him [recognized perceived or understood Him or has had an experiential acquaintance with Him].
1 John,3,7,Boys (lads) let no one deceive and lead you astray. He who practices righteousness [who is upright conforming to the divine will in purpose thought and action living a consistently conscientious life] is righteous even as He is righteous.
1 John,3,8,[But] he who commits sin [who practices evildoing] is of the devil [takes his character from the evil one] for the devil has sinned (violated the divine law) from the beginning. The reason the Son of God was made manifest (visible) was to undo (destroy loosen and dissolve) the works the devil [has done].
1 John,3,9,No one born (begotten) of God [deliberately knowingly and habitually] practices sin for God's nature abides in him [His principle of life the divine sperm remains permanently within him]; and he cannot practice sinning because he is born (begotten) of God.
1 John,3,10,By this it is made clear who take their nature from God and are His children and who take their nature from the devil and are his children: no one who does not practice righteousness [who does not conform to God's will in purpose thought and action] is of God; neither is anyone who does not love his brother (his fellow believer in Christ).
1 John,3,11,For this is the message (the announcement) which you have heard from the first that we should love one another
1 John,3,12,[And] not be like Cain who [took his nature and got his motivation] from the evil one and slew his brother. And why did he slay him? Because his deeds (activities works) were wicked and malicious and his brother's were righteous (virtuous).
1 John,3,13,Do not be surprised and wonder brethren that the world detests and pursues you with hatred.
1 John,3,14,We know that we have passed over out of death into Life by the fact that we love the brethren (our fellow Christians). He who does not love abides (remains is held and kept continually) in [spiritual] death.
1 John,3,15,Anyone who hates (abominates detests) his brother [in Christ] is [at heart] a murderer and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding ( persevering) within him.
1 John,3,16,By this we come to know (progressively to recognize to perceive to understand) the [essential] love: that He laid down His [own] life for us; and we ought to lay [our] lives down for [those who are our] brothers [ in Him].
1 John,3,17,But if anyone has this world's goods (resources for sustaining life) and sees his brother and fellow believer in need yet closes his heart of compassion against him how can the love of God live and remain in him?
1 John,3,18,Little children let us not love [merely] in theory or in speech but in deed and in truth (in practice and in sincerity).
1 John,3,19,By this we shall come to know (perceive recognize and understand) that we are of the Truth and can reassure (quiet conciliate and pacify) our hearts in His presence
1 John,3,20,Whenever our hearts in [ tormenting] self-accusation make us feel guilty and condemn us. [For we are in God's hands.] For He is above and greater than our consciences (our hearts) and He knows (perceives and understands) everything [nothing is hidden from Him].
1 John,3,21,And beloved if our consciences (our hearts) do not accuse us [if they do not make us feel guilty and condemn us] we have confidence (complete assurance and boldness) before God
1 John,3,22,And we receive from Him whatever we ask because we [ watchfully] obey His orders [observe His suggestions and injunctions follow His plan for us] and [ habitually] practice what is pleasing to Him.
1 John,3,23,And this is His order (His command His injunction): that we should believe in (put our faith and trust in and adhere to and rely on) the name of His Son Jesus Christ (the Messiah) and that we should love one another just as He has commanded us.
1 John,3,24,All who keep His commandments [who obey His orders and follow His plan live and continue to live to stay and] abide in Him and He in them. [ They let Christ be a home to them and they are the home of Christ.] And by this we know and understand and have the proof that He [really] lives and makes His home in us: by the [Holy] Spirit Whom He has given us.
1 John,4,1,BELOVED DO not put faith in every spirit but prove (test) the spirits to discover whether they proceed from God; for many false prophets have gone forth into the world.
1 John,4,2,By this you may know (perceive and recognize) the Spirit of God: every spirit which acknowledges and confesses [the fact] that Jesus Christ (the Messiah) [actually] has become man and has come in the flesh is of God [has God for its source];
1 John,4,3,And every spirit which does not acknowledge and confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh [but would annul destroy sever disunite Him] is not of God [does not proceed from Him]. This [ nonconfession] is the [spirit] of the antichrist [of] which you heard that it was coming and now it is already in the world.
1 John,4,4,Little children you are of God [you belong to Him] and have [already] defeated and overcome them [the agents of the antichrist] because He Who lives in you is greater (mightier) than he who is in the world.
1 John,4,5,They proceed from the world and are of the world; therefore it is out of the world [its whole economy morally considered] that they speak and the world listens (pays attention) to them.
1 John,4,6,We are [children] of God. Whoever is learning to know God [progressively to perceive recognize and understand God by observation and experience and to get an ever-clearer knowledge of Him] listens to us; and he who is not of God does not listen or pay attention to us. By this we know (recognize) the Spirit of Truth and the spirit of error.
1 John,4,7,Beloved let us love one another for love is (springs) from God; and he who loves [his fellowmen] is begotten (born) of God and is coming [progressively] to know and understand God [to perceive and recognize and get a better and clearer knowledge of Him].
1 John,4,8,He who does not love has not become acquainted with God [does not and never did know Him] for God is love.
1 John,4,9,In this the love of God was made manifest (displayed) where we are concerned: in that God sent His Son the only begotten or unique [Son] into the world so that we might live through Him.
1 John,4,10,In this is love: not that we loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation (the atoning sacrifice) for our sins.
1 John,4,11,Beloved if God loved us so [very much] we also ought to love one another.
1 John,4,12,No man has at any time [yet] seen God. But if we love one another God abides (lives and remains) in us and His love (that love which is essentially His) is brought to completion (to its full maturity runs its full course is perfected) in us!
1 John,4,13,By this we come to know (perceive recognize and understand) that we abide (live and remain) in Him and He in us: because He has given (imparted) to us of His [Holy] Spirit.
1 John,4,14,And [besides] we ourselves have seen (have deliberately and steadfastly contemplated) and bear witness that the Father has sent the Son [as the] Savior of the world.
1 John,4,15,Anyone who confesses (acknowledges owns) that Jesus is the Son of God God abides (lives makes His home) in him and he [abides lives makes his home] in God.
1 John,4,16,And we know (understand recognize are conscious of by observation and by experience) and believe (adhere to and put faith in and rely on) the love God cherishes for us. God is love and he who dwells and continues in love dwells and continues in God and God dwells and continues in him.
1 John,4,17,In this [union and communion with Him] love is brought to completion and attains perfection with us that we may have confidence for the day of judgment [with assurance and boldness to face Him] because as He is so are we in this world.
1 John,4,18,There is no fear in love [dread does not exist] but full-grown (complete perfect) love turns fear out of doors and expels every trace of terror! For fear brings with it the thought of punishment and [so] he who is afraid has not reached the full maturity of love [is not yet grown into love's complete perfection].
1 John,4,19,We love Him because He first loved us.
1 John,4,20,If anyone says I love God and hates (detests abominates) his brother [ in Christ] he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God Whom he has not seen.
1 John,4,21,And this command (charge order injunction) we have from Him: that he who loves God shall love his brother [ believer] also.
1 John,5,1,EVERYONE WHO believes (adheres to trusts and relies on the fact) that Jesus is the Christ (the Messiah) is a born-again child of God; and everyone who loves the Father also loves the one born of Him (His offspring).
1 John,5,2,By this we come to know (recognize and understand) that we love the children of God: when we love God and obey His commands (orders charges)--[when we keep His ordinances and are mindful of His precepts and His teaching].
1 John,5,3,For the [true] love of God is this: that we do His commands [keep His ordinances and are mindful of His precepts and teaching]. And these orders of His are not irksome (burdensome oppressive or grievous).
1 John,5,4,For whatever is born of God is victorious over the world; and this is the victory that conquers the world even our faith.
1 John,5,5,Who is it that is victorious over [that conquers] the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God [who adheres to trusts in and relies on that fact]?
1 John,5,6,This is He Who came by (with) water and blood [ His baptism and His death] Jesus Christ (the Messiah)--not by (in) the water only but by (in) the water and the blood. And it is the [Holy] Spirit Who bears witness because the [Holy] Spirit is the Truth.
1 John,5,7,So there are three witnesses in heaven: the Father the Word and the Holy Spirit and these three are One;
1 John,5,8,and there are three witnesses on the earth: the Spirit the water and the blood; and these three agree [are in unison; their testimony coincides].
1 John,5,9,If we accept [as we do] the testimony of men [if we are willing to take human authority] the testimony of God is greater (of stronger authority) for this is the testimony of God even the witness which He has borne regarding His Son.
1 John,5,10,He who believes in the Son of God [who adheres to trusts in and relies on Him] has the testimony [possesses this divine attestation] within himself. He who does not believe God [in this way] has made Him out to be and represented Him as a liar because he has not believed (put his faith in adhered to and relied on) the evidence (the testimony) that God has borne regarding His Son.
1 John,5,11,And this is that testimony (that evidence): God gave us eternal life and this life is in His Son.
1 John,5,12,He who possesses the Son has that life; he who does not possess the Son of God does not have that life.
1 John,5,13,I write this to you who believe in (adhere to trust in and rely on) the name of the Son of God [in the peculiar services and blessings conferred by Him on men] so that you may know [with settled and absolute knowledge] that you [already] have life yes eternal life.
1 John,5,14,And this is the confidence (the assurance the privilege of boldness) which we have in Him: [we are sure] that if we ask anything (make any request) according to His will (in agreement with His own plan) He listens to and hears us.
1 John,5,15,And if (since) we [positively] know that He listens to us in whatever we ask we also know [with settled and absolute knowledge] that we have [granted us as our present possessions] the requests made of Him.
1 John,5,16,If anyone sees his brother [believer] committing a sin that does not [lead to] death (the extinguishing of life) he will pray and [God] will give him life [yes He will grant life to all those whose sin is not one leading to death]. There is a sin [that leads] to death; I do not say that one should pray for that.
1 John,5,17,All wrongdoing is sin and there is sin which does not [involve] death [that may be repented of and forgiven].
1 John,5,18,We know [absolutely] that anyone born of God does not [deliberately and knowingly] practice committing sin but the One Who was begotten of God carefully watches over and protects him [Christ's divine presence within him preserves him against the evil] and the wicked one does not lay hold (get a grip) on him or touch [him].
1 John,5,19,We know [positively] that we are of God and the whole world [around us] is under the power of the evil one.
1 John,5,20,And we [have seen and] know [positively] that the Son of God has [actually] come to this world and has given us understanding and insight [progressively] to perceive (recognize) and come to know better and more clearly Him Who is true; and we are in Him Who is true--in His Son Jesus Christ (the Messiah). This [Man] is the true God and Life eternal.
1 John,5,21,Little children keep yourselves from idols (false gods)--[from anything and everything that would occupy the place in your heart due to God from any sort of substitute for Him that would take first place in your life]. Amen (so let it be).
2 John,1,1,THE ELDERLY elder [of the church addresses this letter] to the elect (chosen) lady (Cyria) and her children whom I truly love--and not only I but also all who are [progressively] learning to recognize and know and understand the Truth--
2 John,1,2,Because of the Truth which lives and stays on in our hearts and will be with us forever:
2 John,1,3,Grace (spiritual blessing) mercy and [soul] peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ (the Messiah) the Father's Son in all sincerity (truth) and love.
2 John,1,4,I was greatly delighted to find some of your children walking (living) in [the] Truth just as we have been commanded by the Father [Himself].
2 John,1,5,And now I beg you lady (Cyria) not as if I were issuing a new charge (injunction or command) but [simply recalling to your mind] the one we have had from the beginning that we love one another.
2 John,1,6,And what this love consists in is this: that we live and walk in accordance with and guided by His commandments (His orders ordinances precepts teaching). This is the commandment as you have heard from the beginning that you continue to walk in love [guided by it and following it].
2 John,1,7,For many imposters (seducers deceivers and false leaders) have gone out into the world men who will not acknowledge (confess admit) the coming of Jesus Christ (the Messiah) in bodily form. Such a one is the imposter (the seducer the deceiver the false leader the antagonist of Christ) and the antichrist.
2 John,1,8,Look to yourselves (take care) that you may not lose (throw away or destroy) all that we and you have labored for but that you may [persevere until you] win and receive back a perfect reward [in full].
2 John,1,9,Anyone who runs on ahead [of God] and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ [who is not content with what He taught] does not have God; but he who continues to live in the doctrine (teaching) of Christ [does have God] he has both the Father and the Son.
2 John,1,10,If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine [is disloyal to what Jesus Christ taught] do not receive him [do not accept him do not welcome or admit him] into [your] house or bid him Godspeed or give him any encouragement.
2 John,1,11,For he who wishes him success [who encourages him wishing him Godspeed] is a partaker in his evil doings.
2 John,1,12,I have many things to write to you but I prefer not to do so with paper and ink; I hope to come to see you and talk with you face to face so that our joy may be complete.
2 John,1,13,The children of your elect (chosen) sister wish to be remembered to you. Amen (so be it).
3 John,1,1,THE ELDERLY elder [of the church addresses this letter] to the beloved (esteemed) Gaius whom I truly love.
3 John,1,2,Beloved I pray that you may prosper in every way and [that your body] may keep well even as [I know] your soul keeps well and prospers.
3 John,1,3,In fact I greatly rejoiced when [some of] the brethren from time to time arrived and spoke [so highly] of the sincerity and fidelity of your life as indeed you do live in the Truth [the whole Gospel presents].
3 John,1,4,I have no greater joy than this to hear that my [spiritual] children are living their lives in the Truth.
3 John,1,5,Beloved it is a fine and faithful work that you are doing when you give any service to the [Christian] brethren and [especially when they are] strangers.
3 John,1,6,They have testified before the church of your love and friendship. You will do well to forward them on their journey [and you will please do so] in a way worthy of God's [service].
3 John,1,7,For these [traveling missionaries] have gone out for the Name's sake (for His sake) and are accepting nothing from the Gentiles (the heathen the non-Israelites).
3 John,1,8,So we ourselves ought to support such people [to welcome and provide for them] in order that we may be fellow workers in the Truth (the whole Gospel) and cooperate with its teachers.
3 John,1,9,I have written briefly to the church; but Diotrephes who likes to take the lead among them and put himself first does not acknowledge my authority and refuses to accept my suggestions or to listen to me.
3 John,1,10,So when I arrive I will call attention to what he is doing his boiling over and casting malicious reflections upon us with insinuating language. And not satisfied with that he refuses to receive and welcome the [missionary] brethren himself and also interferes with and forbids those who would welcome them and tries to expel (excommunicate) them from the church.
3 John,1,11,Beloved do not imitate evil but imitate good. He who does good is of God; he who does evil has not seen (discerned or experienced) God [has enjoyed no vision of Him and does not know Him at all].
3 John,1,12,Demetrius has warm commendation from everyone--and from the Truth itself; we add our testimony also and you know that our testimony is true.
3 John,1,13,I had much [to say to you when I began] to write but I prefer not to put it down with pen (a reed) and ink;
3 John,1,14,I hope to see you soon and we will talk together face to face.
Jude,1,1,JUDE A servant of Jesus Christ (the Messiah) and brother of James [writes this letter] to those who are called (chosen) dearly loved by God the Father and separated (set apart) and kept for Jesus Christ:
Jude,1,2,May mercy [soul] peace and love be multiplied to you.
Jude,1,3,Beloved my whole concern was to write to you in regard to our common salvation. [But] I found it necessary and was impelled to write you and urgently appeal to and exhort [you] to contend for the faith which was once for all handed down to the saints [the faith which is that sum of Christian belief which was delivered verbally to the holy people of God].
Jude,1,4,For certain men have crept in stealthily [ gaining entrance secretly by a side door]. Their doom was predicted long ago ungodly (impious profane) persons who pervert the grace (the spiritual blessing and favor) of our God into lawlessness and wantonness and immorality and disown and deny our sole Master and Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One).
Jude,1,5,Now I want to remind you though you were fully informed once for all that though the Lord [at one time] delivered a people out of the land of Egypt He subsequently destroyed those [of them] who did not believe [who refused to adhere to trust in and rely upon Him].
Jude,1,6,And angels who did not keep (care for guard and hold to) their own first place of power but abandoned their proper dwelling place--these He has reserved in custody in eternal chains (bonds) under the thick gloom of utter darkness until the judgment and doom of the great day.
Jude,1,7,[The wicked are sentenced to suffer] just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the adjacent towns--which likewise gave themselves over to impurity and indulged in unnatural vice and sensual perversity--are laid out [in plain sight] as an exhibit of perpetual punishment [to warn] of everlasting fire.
Jude,1,8,Nevertheless in like manner these dreamers also corrupt the body scorn and reject authority and government and revile and libel and scoff at [heavenly] glories (the glorious ones).
Jude,1,9,But when [even] the archangel Michael contending with the devil judicially argued (disputed) about the body of Moses he dared not [presume to] bring an abusive condemnation against him but [simply] said The Lord rebuke you!
Jude,1,10,But these men revile (scoff and sneer at) anything they do not happen to be acquainted with and do not understand; and whatever they do understand physically [that which they know by mere instinct] like irrational beasts--by these they corrupt themselves and are destroyed (perish).
Jude,1,11,Woe to them! For they have run riotously in the way of Cain and have abandoned themselves for the sake of gain [it offers them following] the error of Balaam and have perished in rebellion [like that] of Korah!
Jude,1,12,These are hidden reefs (elements of danger) in your love feasts where they boldly feast sumptuously [carousing together in your midst] without scruples providing for themselves [alone]. They are clouds without water swept along by the winds; trees without fruit at the late autumn gathering time--twice (doubly) dead [lifeless and] plucked up by the roots;
Jude,1,13,Wild waves of the sea flinging up the foam of their own shame and disgrace; wandering stars for whom the gloom of eternal darkness has been reserved forever.
Jude,1,14,It was of these people moreover that Enoch in the seventh [generation] from Adam prophesied when he said Behold the Lord comes with His myriads of holy ones (ten thousands of His saints)
Jude,1,15,To execute judgment upon all and to convict all the impious (unholy ones) of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed [in such an] ungodly [way] and of all the severe (abusive jarring) things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.
Jude,1,16,These are inveterate murmurers (grumblers) who complain [of their lot in life] going after their own desires [controlled by their passions]; their talk is boastful and arrogant [and they claim to] admire men's persons and pay people flattering compliments to gain advantage.
Jude,1,17,But you must remember beloved the predictions which were made by the apostles (the special messengers) of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah the Anointed One).
Jude,1,18,They told you beforehand In the last days (in the end time) there will be scoffers [who seek to gratify their own unholy desires] following after their own ungodly passions.
Jude,1,19,It is these who are [agitators] setting up distinctions and causing divisions--merely sensual [creatures carnal worldly-minded people] devoid of the [Holy] Spirit and destitute of any higher spiritual life.
Jude,1,20,But you beloved build yourselves up [founded] on your most holy faith [ make progress rise like an edifice higher and higher] praying in the Holy Spirit;
Jude,1,21,Guard and keep yourselves in the love of God; expect and patiently wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah)--[which will bring you] unto life eternal.
Jude,1,22,And refute [so as to] convict some who dispute with you and on some have mercy who waver and doubt.
Jude,1,23,[Strive to] save others snatching [them] out of [the] fire; on others take pity [but] with fear loathing even the garment spotted by the flesh and polluted by their sensuality.
Jude,1,24,Now to Him Who is able to keep you without stumbling or slipping or falling and to present [you] unblemished (blameless and faultless) before the presence of His glory in triumphant joy and exultation [with unspeakable ecstatic delight]--
Jude,1,25,To the one only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord be glory (splendor) majesty might and dominion and power and authority before all time and now and forever (unto all the ages of eternity). Amen (so be it).
Revelation,1,1,[THIS IS] the revelation of Jesus Christ [His unveiling of the divine mysteries]. God gave it to Him to disclose and make known to His bond servants certain things which must shortly and speedily come to pass in their entirety. And He sent and communicated it through His angel (messenger) to His bond servant John
Revelation,1,2,Who has testified to and vouched for all that he saw [ in his visions] the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.
Revelation,1,3,Blessed (happy to be envied) is the man who reads aloud [in the assemblies] the word of this prophecy; and blessed (happy to be envied) are those who hear [it read] and who keep themselves true to the things which are written in it [heeding them and laying them to heart] for the time [for them to be fulfilled] is near.
Revelation,1,4,John to the seven assemblies (churches) that are in Asia: May grace (God's unmerited favor) be granted to you and spiritual peace ( the peace of Christ's kingdom) from Him Who is and Who was and Who is to come and from the seven Spirits [ the sevenfold Holy Spirit] before His throne
Revelation,1,5,And from Jesus Christ the faithful and trustworthy Witness the Firstborn of the dead [first to be brought back to life] and the Prince (Ruler) of the kings of the earth. To Him Who ever loves us and has once [for all] loosed and freed us from our sins by His own blood
Revelation,1,6,And formed us into a kingdom (a royal race) priests to His God and Father--to Him be the glory and the power and the majesty and the dominion throughout the ages and forever and ever. Amen (so be it).
Revelation,1,7,Behold He is coming with the clouds and every eye will see Him even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth shall gaze upon Him and beat their breasts and mourn and lament over Him. Even so [must it be]. Amen (so be it).
Revelation,1,8,I am the Alpha and the Omega the Beginning and the End says the Lord God He Who is and Who was and Who is to come the Almighty (the Ruler of all).
Revelation,1,9,I John your brother and companion (sharer and participator) with you in the tribulation and kingdom and patient endurance [which are] in Jesus Christ was on the isle called Patmos [banished] on account of [my witnessing to] the Word of God and the testimony (the proof the evidence) for Jesus Christ.
Revelation,1,10,I was in the Spirit [rapt in His power] on the Lord's Day and I heard behind me a great voice like the calling of a war trumpet
Revelation,1,11,Saying I am the Alpha and the Omega the First and the Last. Write promptly what you see (your vision) in a book and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia--to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.
Revelation,1,12,Then I turned to see [whose was] the voice that was speaking to me and on turning I saw seven golden lampstands
Revelation,1,13,And in the midst of the lampstands [One] like a Son of Man clothed with a robe which reached to His feet and with a girdle of gold about His breast.
Revelation,1,14,His head and His hair were white like white wool [as white] as snow and His eyes [flashed] like a flame of fire.
Revelation,1,15,His feet glowed like burnished (bright) bronze as it is refined in a furnace and His voice was like the sound of many waters.
Revelation,1,16,In His right hand He held seven stars and from His mouth there came forth a sharp two-edged sword and His face was like the sun shining in full power at midday.
Revelation,1,17,When I saw Him I fell at His feet as if dead. But He laid His right hand on me and said Do not be afraid! I am the First and the Last
Revelation,1,18,And the Ever-living One [I am living in the eternity of the eternities]. I died but see I am alive forevermore; and I possess the keys of death and Hades (the realm of the dead).
Revelation,1,19,Write therefore the things you see what they are [and signify] and what is to take place hereafter.
Revelation,1,20,As to the hidden meaning (the mystery) of the seven stars which you saw on My right hand and the seven lampstands of gold: the seven stars are the seven angels (messengers) of the seven assemblies (churches) and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.
Revelation,2,1,TO THE angel (messenger) of the assembly (church) in Ephesus write: These are the words of Him Who holds the seven stars [which are the messengers of the seven churches] in His right hand Who goes about among the seven golden lampstands [which are the seven churches]:
Revelation,2,2,I know your industry and activities laborious toil and trouble and your patient endurance and how you cannot tolerate wicked [men] and have tested and critically appraised those who call [themselves] apostles (special messengers of Christ) and yet are not and have found them to be impostors and liars.
Revelation,2,3,I know you are enduring patiently and are bearing up for My name's sake and you have not fainted or become exhausted or grown weary.
Revelation,2,4,But I have this [one charge to make] against you: that you have left (abandoned) the love that you had at first [you have deserted Me your first love].
Revelation,2,5,Remember then from what heights you have fallen. Repent (change the inner man to meet God's will) and do the works you did previously [when first you knew the Lord] or else I will visit you and remove your lampstand from its place unless you change your mind and repent.
Revelation,2,6,Yet you have this [in your favor and to your credit]: you hate the works of the Nicolaitans [what they are doing as corrupters of the people] which I Myself also detest.
Revelation,2,7,He who is able to hear let him listen to and give heed to what the Spirit says to the assemblies (churches). To him who overcomes (is victorious) I will grant to eat [of the fruit] of the tree of life which is in the paradise of God.
Revelation,2,8,And to the angel (messenger) of the assembly (church) in Smyrna write: These are the words of the First and the Last Who died and came to life again:
Revelation,2,9,I know your affliction and distress and pressing trouble and your poverty--but you are rich! and how you are abused and reviled and slandered by those who say they are Jews and are not but are a synagogue of Satan.
Revelation,2,10,Fear nothing that you are about to suffer. [Dismiss your dread and your fears!] Behold the devil is indeed about to throw some of you into prison that you may be tested and proved and critically appraised and for ten days you will have affliction. Be loyally faithful unto death [even if you must die for it] and I will give you the crown of life.
Revelation,2,11,He who is able to hear let him listen to and heed what the Spirit says to the assemblies (churches). He who overcomes (is victorious) shall in no way be injured by the second death.
Revelation,2,12,Then to the angel (messenger) of the assembly (church) in Pergamum write: These are the words of Him Who has and wields the sharp two-edged sword:
Revelation,2,13,I know where you live--a place where Satan sits enthroned. [Yet] you are clinging to and holding fast My name and you did not deny My faith even in the days of Antipas My witness My faithful one who was killed (martyred) in your midst--where Satan dwells.
Revelation,2,14,Nevertheless I have a few things against you: you have some people there who are clinging to the teaching of Balaam who taught Balak to set a trap and a stumbling block before the sons of Israel [to entice them] to eat food that had been sacrificed to idols and to practice lewdness [giving themselves up to sexual vice].
Revelation,2,15,You also have some who in a similar way are clinging to the teaching of the Nicolaitans [those corrupters of the people] which thing I hate.
Revelation,2,16,Repent [then]! Or else I will come to you quickly and fight against them with the sword of My mouth.
Revelation,2,17,He who is able to hear let him listen to and heed what the Spirit says to the assemblies (churches). To him who overcomes (conquers) I will give to eat of the manna that is hidden and I will give him a white stone with a new name engraved on the stone which no one knows or understands except he who receives it.
Revelation,2,18,And to the angel (messenger) of the assembly (church) in Thyatira write: These are the words of the Son of God Who has eyes that flash like a flame of fire and Whose feet glow like bright and burnished and white-hot bronze:
Revelation,2,19,I know your record and what you are doing your love and faith and service and patient endurance and that your recent works are more numerous and greater than your first ones.
Revelation,2,20,But I have this against you: that you tolerate the woman Jezebel who calls herself a prophetess [claiming to be inspired] and who is teaching and leading astray my servants and beguiling them into practicing sexual vice and eating food sacrificed to idols. [I Kings 16:31; II Kings 9:22 30.]
Revelation,2,21,I gave her time to repent but she has no desire to repent of her immorality [symbolic of idolatry] and refuses to do so.
Revelation,2,22,Take note: I will throw her on a bed [ of anguish] and those who commit adultery with her [her paramours] I will bring down to pressing distress and severe affliction unless they turn away their minds from conduct [such as] hers and repent of their doings.
Revelation,2,23,And I will strike her children (her proper followers) dead [thoroughly exterminating them]. And all the assemblies (churches) shall recognize and understand that I am He Who searches minds (the thoughts feelings and purposes) and the [inmost] hearts and I will give to each of you [the reward for what you have done] as your work deserves.
Revelation,2,24,But to the rest of you in Thyatira who do not hold this teaching who have not explored and known the depths of Satan as they say--I tell you that I do not lay upon you any other [fresh] burden:
Revelation,2,25,Only hold fast to what you have until I come.
Revelation,2,26,And he who overcomes (is victorious) and who obeys My commands to the [very] end [doing the works that please Me] I will give him authority and power over the nations;
Revelation,2,27,And he shall rule them with a sceptre (rod) of iron as when earthen pots are broken in pieces and [his power over them shall be] like that which I Myself have received from My Father;
Revelation,2,28,And I will give him the Morning Star.
Revelation,2,29,He who is able to hear let him listen to and heed what the [Holy] Spirit says to the assemblies (churches).
Revelation,3,1,AND TO the angel (messenger) of the assembly (church) in Sardis write: These are the words of Him Who has the seven Spirits of God [ the sevenfold Holy Spirit] and the seven stars: I know your record and what you are doing; you are supposed to be alive but [in reality] you are dead.
Revelation,3,2,Rouse yourselves and keep awake and strengthen and invigorate what remains and is on the point of dying; for I have not found a thing that you have done [any work of yours] meeting the requirements of My God or perfect in His sight.
Revelation,3,3,So call to mind the lessons you received and heard; continually lay them to heart and obey them and repent. In case you will not rouse yourselves and keep awake and watch I will come upon you like a thief and you will not know or suspect at what hour I will come.
Revelation,3,4,Yet you still have a few [persons'] names in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes and they shall walk with Me in white because they are worthy and deserving.
Revelation,3,5,Thus shall he who conquers (is victorious) be clad in white garments and I will not erase or blot out his name from the Book of Life; I will acknowledge him [as Mine] and I will confess his name openly before My Father and before His angels.
Revelation,3,6,He who is able to hear let him listen to and heed what the [Holy] Spirit says to the assemblies (churches).
Revelation,3,7,And to the angel (messenger) of the assembly (church) in Philadelphia write: These are the words of the Holy One the True One He Who has the key of David Who opens and no one shall shut Who shuts and no one shall open:
Revelation,3,8,I know your [record of] works and what you are doing. See! I have set before you a door wide open which no one is able to shut; I know that you have but little power and yet you have kept My Word and guarded My message and have not renounced or denied My name.
Revelation,3,9,Take note! I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say they are Jews and are not but lie--behold I will make them come and bow down before your feet and learn and acknowledge that I have loved you.
Revelation,3,10,Because you have guarded and kept My word of patient endurance [have held fast the lesson of My patience with the expectant endurance that I give you] I also will keep you [safe] from the hour of trial (testing) which is coming on the whole world to try those who dwell upon the earth.
Revelation,3,11,I am coming quickly; hold fast what you have so that no one may rob you and deprive you of your crown.
Revelation,3,12,He who overcomes (is victorious) I will make him a pillar in the sanctuary of My God; he shall never be put out of it or go out of it and I will write on him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God the new Jerusalem which descends from My God out of heaven and My own new name.
Revelation,3,13,He who can hear let him listen to and heed what the Spirit says to the assemblies (churches).
Revelation,3,14,And to the angel (messenger) of the assembly (church) in Laodicea write: These are the words of the Amen the trusty and faithful and true Witness the Origin and Beginning and Author of God's creation:
Revelation,3,15,I know your [record of] works and what you are doing; you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were cold or hot!
Revelation,3,16,So because you are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew you out of My mouth!
Revelation,3,17,For you say I am rich; I have prospered and grown wealthy and I am in need of nothing; and you do not realize and understand that you are wretched pitiable poor blind and naked.
Revelation,3,18,Therefore I counsel you to purchase from Me gold refined and tested by fire that you may be [truly] wealthy and white clothes to clothe you and to keep the shame of your nudity from being seen and salve to put on your eyes that you may see.
Revelation,3,19,Those whom I [dearly and tenderly] love I tell their faults and convict and convince and reprove and chasten [I discipline and instruct them]. So be enthusiastic and in earnest and burning with zeal and repent [changing your mind and attitude].
Revelation,3,20,Behold I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears and listens to and heeds My voice and opens the door I will come in to him and will eat with him and he [will eat] with Me.
Revelation,3,21,He who overcomes (is victorious) I will grant him to sit beside Me on My throne as I Myself overcame (was victorious) and sat down beside My Father on His throne.
Revelation,3,22,He who is able to hear let him listen to and heed what the [Holy] Spirit says to the assemblies (churches).
Revelation,4,1,AFTER THIS I looked and behold a door standing open in heaven! And the first voice which I had heard addressing me like [the calling of] a war trumpet said Come up here and I will show you what must take place in the future.
Revelation,4,2,At once I came under the [Holy] Spirit's power and behold a throne stood in heaven with One seated on the throne!
Revelation,4,3,And He Who sat there appeared like [the crystalline brightness of] jasper and [the fiery] sardius and encircling the throne there was a halo that looked like [a rainbow of] emerald.
Revelation,4,4,Twenty-four other thrones surrounded the throne and seated on these thrones were twenty-four elders ( the members of the heavenly Sanhedrin) arrayed in white clothing with crowns of gold upon their heads.
Revelation,4,5,Out from the throne came flashes of lightning and rumblings and peals of thunder and in front of the throne seven blazing torches burned which are the seven Spirits of God [ the sevenfold Holy Spirit];
Revelation,4,6,And in front of the throne there was also what looked like a transparent glassy sea as if of crystal. And around the throne in the center at each side of the throne were four living creatures (beings) who were full of eyes in front and behind [with intelligence as to what is before and at the rear of them].
Revelation,4,7,The first living creature (being) was like a lion the second living creature like an ox the third living creature had the face of a man and the fourth living creature [was] like a flying eagle.
Revelation,4,8,And the four living creatures individually having six wings were full of eyes all over and within [underneath their wings]; and day and night they never stop saying Holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty (Omnipotent) Who was and Who is and Who is to come.
Revelation,4,9,And whenever the living creatures offer glory and honor and thanksgiving to Him Who sits on the throne Who lives forever and ever (through the eternities of the eternities)
Revelation,4,10,The twenty-four elders ( the members of the heavenly Sanhedrin) fall prostrate before Him Who is sitting on the throne and they worship Him Who lives forever and ever; and they throw down their crowns before the throne crying out
Revelation,4,11,Worthy are You our Lord and God to receive the glory and the honor and dominion for You created all things; by Your will they were [brought into being] and were created.
Revelation,5,1,AND I saw lying on the open hand of Him Who was seated on the throne a scroll (book) written within and on the back closed and sealed with seven seals;
Revelation,5,2,And I saw a strong angel announcing in a loud voice Who is worthy to open the scroll? And [who is entitled and deserves and is morally fit] to break its seals?
Revelation,5,3,And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth [in the realm of the dead Hades] was able to open the scroll or to take a [single] look at its contents.
Revelation,5,4,And I wept audibly and bitterly because no one was found fit to open the scroll or to inspect it.
Revelation,5,5,Then one of the elders [ of the heavenly Sanhedrin] said to me Stop weeping! See the Lion of the tribe of Judah the Root (Source) of David has won (has overcome and conquered)! He can open the scroll and break its seven seals!
Revelation,5,6,And there between the throne and the four living creatures (beings) and among the elders [ of the heavenly Sanhedrin] I saw a Lamb standing as though it had been slain with seven horns and with seven eyes which are the seven Spirits of God [ the sevenfold Holy Spirit] Who have been sent [on duty far and wide] into all the earth.
Revelation,5,7,He then went and took the scroll from the right hand of Him Who sat on the throne.
Revelation,5,8,And when He had taken the scroll the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders [ of the heavenly Sanhedrin] prostrated themselves before the Lamb. Each was holding a harp (lute or guitar) and they had golden bowls full of incense (fragrant spices and gums for burning) which are the prayers of God's people (the saints).
Revelation,5,9,And [now] they sing a new song saying You are worthy to take the scroll and to break the seals that are on it for You were slain (sacrificed) and with Your blood You purchased men unto God from every tribe and language and people and nation.
Revelation,5,10,And You have made them a kingdom (royal race) and priests to our God and they shall reign [as kings] over the earth!
Revelation,5,11,Then I looked and I heard the voices of many angels on every side of the throne and of the living creatures and the elders [ of the heavenly Sanhedrin] and they numbered ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands
Revelation,5,12,Saying in a loud voice Deserving is the Lamb Who was sacrificed to receive all the power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and majesty (glory splendor) and blessing!
Revelation,5,13,And I heard every created thing in heaven and on earth and under the earth [in Hades the place of departed spirits] and on the sea and all that is in it crying out together To Him Who is seated on the throne and to the Lamb be ascribed the blessing and the honor and the majesty (glory splendor) and the power (might and dominion) forever and ever (through the eternities of the eternities)!
Revelation,5,14,Then the four living creatures (beings) said Amen (so be it)! And the elders [ of the heavenly Sanhedrin] prostrated themselves and worshiped Him Who lives forever and ever.
Revelation,6,1,THEN I saw as the Lamb broke open one of the seven seals and as if in a voice of thunder I heard one of the four living creatures call out Come!
Revelation,6,2,And I looked and saw there a white horse whose rider carried a bow. And a crown was given him and he rode forth conquering and to conquer.
Revelation,6,3,And when He broke the second seal I heard the second living creature call out Come!
Revelation,6,4,And another horse came out flaming red. And its rider was empowered to take the peace from the earth so that men slaughtered one another; and he was given a huge sword.
Revelation,6,5,When He broke open the third seal I heard the third living creature call out Come and look! And I saw and behold a black horse and in his hand the rider had a pair of scales (a balance).
Revelation,6,6,And I heard what seemed to be a voice from the midst of the four living creatures saying A quart of wheat for a denarius [a whole day's wages] and three quarts of barley for a denarius; but do not harm the oil and the wine! [II Kings 6:25.]
Revelation,6,7,When the Lamb broke open the fourth seal I heard the fourth living creature call out Come!
Revelation,6,8,So I looked and behold an ashy pale horse [ black and blue as if made so by bruising] and its rider's name was Death and Hades (the realm of the dead) followed him closely. And they were given authority and power over a fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with famine and with plague (pestilence disease) and with wild beasts of the earth.
Revelation,6,9,When the Lamb broke open the fifth seal I saw at the foot of the altar the souls of those whose lives had been sacrificed for [adhering to] the Word of God and for the testimony they had borne.
Revelation,6,10,They cried in a loud voice O [Sovereign] Lord holy and true how long now before You will sit in judgment and avenge our blood upon those who dwell on the earth?
Revelation,6,11,Then they were each given a long and flowing and festive white robe and told to rest and wait patiently a little while longer until the number should be complete of their fellow servants and their brethren who were to be killed as they themselves had been.
Revelation,6,12,When He [the Lamb] broke open the sixth seal I looked and there was a great earthquake; and the sun grew black as sackcloth of hair [the full disc of] the moon became like blood.
Revelation,6,13,And the stars of the sky dropped to the earth like a fig tree shedding its unripe fruit out of season when shaken by a strong wind.
Revelation,6,14,And the sky rolled up like a scroll and vanished and every mountain and island was dislodged from its place.
Revelation,6,15,Then the kings of the earth and their noblemen and their magnates and their military chiefs and the wealthy and the strong and [everyone whether] slave or free hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains
Revelation,6,16,And they called to the mountains and the rocks Fall on (before) us and hide us from the face of Him Who sits on the throne and from the deep-seated indignation and wrath of the Lamb.
Revelation,6,17,For the great day of His wrath (vengeance retribution indignation) has come and who is able to stand before it?
Revelation,7,1,AFTER THIS I saw four angels stationed at the four corners of the earth firmly holding back the four winds of the earth so that no wind should blow on the earth or sea or upon any tree.
Revelation,7,2,Then I saw a second angel coming up from the east (the rising of the sun) and carrying the seal of the living God. And with a loud voice he called out to the four angels who had been given authority and power to injure earth and sea
Revelation,7,3,Saying Harm neither the earth nor the sea nor the trees until we have sealed the bond servants of our God upon their foreheads.
Revelation,7,4,And [then] I heard how many were sealed (marked) out of every tribe of the sons of Israel: there were 144000.
Revelation,7,5,Twelve thousand were sealed (marked) out of the tribe of Judah 12000 of the tribe of Reuben 12000 of the tribe of Gad
Revelation,7,6,Twelve thousand of the tribe of Asher 12000 of the tribe of Naphtali 12000 of the tribe of Manasseh
Revelation,7,7,Twelve thousand of the tribe of Simeon 12000 of the tribe of Levi 12000 of the tribe of Issachar
Revelation,7,8,Twelve thousand of the tribe of Zebulun 12000 of the tribe of Joseph 12000 of the tribe of Benjamin.
Revelation,7,9,After this I looked and a vast host appeared which no one could count [gathered out] of every nation from all tribes and peoples and languages. These stood before the throne and before the Lamb; they were attired in white robes with palm branches in their hands.
Revelation,7,10,In loud voice they cried saying [Our] salvation is due to our God Who is seated on the throne and to the Lamb [to Them we owe our deliverance]!
Revelation,7,11,And all the angels were standing round the throne and round the elders [ of the heavenly Sanhedrin] and the four living creatures and they fell prostrate before the throne and worshiped God.
Revelation,7,12,Amen! (So be it!) they cried. Blessing and glory and majesty and splendor and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and might [be ascribed] to our God to the ages and ages (forever and ever throughout the eternities of the eternities)! Amen! (So be it!)
Revelation,7,13,Then addressing me one of the elders [ of the heavenly Sanhedrin] said Who are these [people] clothed in the long white robes? And from where have they come?
Revelation,7,14,I replied Sir you know. And he said to me These are they who have come out of the great tribulation (persecution) and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
Revelation,7,15,For this reason they are [now] before the [very] throne of God and serve Him day and night in His sanctuary (temple); and He Who is sitting upon the throne will protect and spread His tabernacle over and shelter them with His presence.
Revelation,7,16,They shall hunger no more neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun smite them nor any scorching heat.
Revelation,7,17,For the Lamb Who is in the midst of the throne will be their Shepherd and He will guide them to the springs of the waters of life; and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.
Revelation,8,1,WHEN HE [the Lamb] broke open the seventh seal there was silence for about half an hour in heaven.
Revelation,8,2,Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God and to them were given seven trumpets.
Revelation,8,3,And another angel came and stood over the altar. He had a golden censer and he was given very much incense (fragrant spices and gums which exhale perfume when burned) that he might mingle it with the prayers of all the people of God (the saints) upon the golden altar before the throne.
Revelation,8,4,And the smoke of the incense (the perfume) arose in the presence of God with the prayers of the people of God (the saints) from the hand of the angel.
Revelation,8,5,So the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and cast it upon the earth. Then there followed peals of thunder and loud rumblings and blasts and noises and flashes of lightning and an earthquake.
Revelation,8,6,Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.
Revelation,8,7,The first angel blew [his] trumpet and there was a storm of hail and fire mingled with blood cast upon the earth. And a third part of the earth was burned up and a third of the trees was burned up and all the green grass was burned up.
Revelation,8,8,The second angel blew [his] trumpet and something resembling a great mountain blazing with fire was hurled into the sea.
Revelation,8,9,And a third of the sea was turned to blood a third of the living creatures in the sea perished and a third of the ships were destroyed.
Revelation,8,10,The third angel blew [his] trumpet and a huge star fell from heaven burning like a torch and it dropped on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water--
Revelation,8,11,And the name of the star is Wormwood. A third part of the waters was changed into wormwood and many people died from using the water because it had become bitter.
Revelation,8,12,Then the fourth angel blew [his] trumpet and a third of the sun was smitten and a third of the moon and a third of the stars so that [the light of] a third of them was darkened and a third of the daylight [itself] was withdrawn and likewise a third [of the light] of the night was kept from shining.
Revelation,8,13,Then I [looked and I] saw a solitary eagle flying in midheaven and as it flew I heard it crying with a loud voice Woe woe woe to those who dwell on the earth because of the rest of the trumpet blasts which the three angels are about to sound!
Revelation,9,1,THEN THE fifth angel blew [his] trumpet and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth; and to the angel was given the key of the shaft of the Abyss (the bottomless pit).
Revelation,9,2,He opened the long shaft of the Abyss (the bottomless pit) and smoke like the smoke of a huge furnace puffed out of the long shaft so that the sun and the atmosphere were darkened by the smoke from the long shaft.
Revelation,9,3,Then out of the smoke locusts came forth on the earth and such power was granted them as the power the earth's scorpions have.
Revelation,9,4,They were told not to injure the herbage of the earth nor any green thing nor any tree but only [to attack] such human beings as do not have the seal (mark) of God on their foreheads.
Revelation,9,5,They were not permitted to kill them but to torment (distress vex) them for five months; and the pain caused them was like the torture of a scorpion when it stings a person.
Revelation,9,6,And in those days people will seek death and will not find it; and they will yearn to die but death evades and flees from them.
Revelation,9,7,The locusts resembled horses equipped for battle. On their heads was something like golden crowns. Their faces resembled the faces of people.
Revelation,9,8,They had hair like the hair of women and their teeth were like lions' teeth.
Revelation,9,9,Their breastplates (scales) resembled breastplates made of iron and the [whirring] noise made by their wings was like the roar of a vast number of horse-drawn chariots going at full speed into battle.
Revelation,9,10,They have tails like scorpions and they have stings and in their tails lies their ability to hurt men for [the] five months.
Revelation,9,11,Over them as king they have the angel of the Abyss (of the bottomless pit). In Hebrew his name is Abaddon [destruction] but in Greek he is called Apollyon [destroyer].
Revelation,9,12,The first woe (calamity) has passed; behold two others are yet to follow.
Revelation,9,13,Then the sixth angel blew [his] trumpet and from the four horns of the golden altar which stands before God I heard a solitary voice
Revelation,9,14,Saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet Liberate the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.
Revelation,9,15,So the four angels who had been in readiness for that hour in the appointed day month and year were liberated to destroy a third of mankind.
Revelation,9,16,The number of their troops of cavalry was twice ten thousand times ten thousand (200000000); I heard what their number was.
Revelation,9,17,And in [my] vision the horses and their riders appeared to me like this: the riders wore breastplates the color of fiery red and sapphire blue and sulphur (brimstone) yellow. The heads of the horses looked like lions' heads and from their mouths there poured fire and smoke and sulphur (brimstone).
Revelation,9,18,A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues--by the fire and the smoke and the sulphur (brimstone) that poured from the mouths of the horses.
Revelation,9,19,For the power of the horses to do harm is in their mouths and also in their tails. Their tails are like serpents for they have heads and it is by means of them that they wound people.
Revelation,9,20,And the rest of humanity who were not killed by these plagues even then did not repent of [the worship of] the works of their [own] hands so as to cease paying homage to the demons and idols of gold and silver and bronze and stone and wood which can neither see nor hear nor move.
Revelation,9,21,And they did not repent of their murders or their practice of magic (sorceries) or their sexual vice or their thefts.
Revelation,10,1,THEN I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven robed in a cloud with a [halo like a] rainbow over his head; his face was like the sun and his feet (legs) were like columns of fire.
Revelation,10,2,He had a little book (scroll) open in his hand. He set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land
Revelation,10,3,And he shouted with a loud voice like the roaring of a lion; and when he had shouted the seven thunders gave voice and uttered their message in distinct words.
Revelation,10,4,And when the seven thunders had spoken (sounded) I was going to write [it down] but I heard a voice from heaven saying Seal up what the seven thunders have said! Do not write it down!
Revelation,10,5,Then the [mighty] angel whom I had seen stationed on sea and land raised his right hand to heaven (the sky)
Revelation,10,6,And swore in the name of (by) Him Who lives forever and ever Who created the heavens ( sky) and all they contain and the earth and all that it contains and the sea and all that it contains. [He swore] that no more time should intervene and there should be no more waiting or delay
Revelation,10,7,But that when the days come when the trumpet call of the seventh angel is about to be sounded then God's mystery (His secret design His hidden purpose) as He had announced the glad tidings to His servants the prophets should be fulfilled (accomplished completed).
Revelation,10,8,Then the voice that I heard from heaven spoke again to me saying Go and take the little book (scroll) which is open on the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.
Revelation,10,9,So I went up to the angel and asked him to give me the little book. And he said to me Take it and eat it. It will embitter your stomach though in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.
Revelation,10,10,So I took the little book from the angel's hand and ate and swallowed it; it was as sweet as honey in my mouth but once I had swallowed it my stomach was embittered.
Revelation,10,11,Then they said to me You are to make a fresh prophecy concerning many peoples and races and nations and languages and kings.
Revelation,11,1,A REED [as a measuring rod] was then given to me [shaped] like a staff and I was told: Rise up and measure the sanctuary of God and the altar [of incense] and [number] those who worship there.
Revelation,11,2,But leave out of your measuring the court outside the sanctuary of God; omit that for it is given over to the Gentiles (the nations) and they will trample the holy city underfoot for 42 months (three and one-half years).
Revelation,11,3,And I will grant the power of prophecy to My two witnesses for 1260 (42 months; three and one-half years) dressed in sackcloth.
Revelation,11,4,These [witnesses] are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which stand before the Lord of the earth.
Revelation,11,5,And if anyone attempts to injure them fire pours from their mouth and consumes their enemies; if anyone should attempt to harm them thus he is doomed to be slain. [II Kings 1:10; Jer. 5:14.]
Revelation,11,6,These [two witnesses] have power to shut up the sky so that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying (their prediction of events relating to Christ's kingdom and its speedy triumph); and they also have power to turn the waters into blood and to smite and scourge the earth with all manner of plagues as often as they choose.
Revelation,11,7,But when they have finished their testimony and their evidence is all in the beast (monster) that comes up out of the Abyss (bottomless pit) will wage war on them and conquer them and kill them.
Revelation,11,8,And their dead bodies [will lie exposed] in the open street ( a public square) of the great city which is in a spiritual sense called [by the mystical and allegorical names of] Sodom and Egypt where also their Lord was crucified.
Revelation,11,9,For three and a half days men from the races and tribes and languages and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and will not allow them to be put in a tomb.
Revelation,11,10,And those who dwell on the earth will gloat and exult over them and rejoice exceedingly taking their ease and sending presents [in congratulation] to one another because these two prophets had been such a vexation and trouble and torment to all the dwellers on the earth.
Revelation,11,11,But after three and a half days by God's gift the breath of life again entered into them and they rose up on their feet and great dread and terror fell on those who watched them.
Revelation,11,12,Then [the two witnesses] heard a strong voice from heaven calling to them Come up here! And before the very eyes of their enemies they ascended into heaven in a cloud. [II Kings 2:11.]
Revelation,11,13,And at that [very] hour there was a tremendous earthquake and one tenth of the city was destroyed (fell); seven thousand people perished in the earthquake and those who remained were filled with dread and terror and were awe-struck and they glorified the God of heaven.
Revelation,11,14,The second woe (calamity) has passed; now the third woe is speedily to come.
Revelation,11,15,The seventh angel then blew [his] trumpet and there were mighty voices in heaven shouting The dominion (kingdom sovereignty rule) of the world has now come into the possession and become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ (the Messiah) and He shall reign forever and ever (for the eternities of the eternities)!
Revelation,11,16,Then the twenty-four elders [of the heavenly Sanhedrin] who sit on their thrones before God prostrated themselves before Him and worshiped
Revelation,11,17,Exclaiming To You we give thanks Lord God Omnipotent [the One] Who is and [ever] was for assuming the high sovereignty and the great power that are Yours and for beginning to reign.
Revelation,11,18,And the heathen (the nations) raged but Your wrath (retribution indignation) came the time when the dead will be judged and Your servants the prophets and saints rewarded--and those who revere (fear) Your name both low and high and small and great--and [the time] for destroying the corrupters of the earth.
Revelation,11,19,Then the sanctuary of God in heaven was thrown open and the ark of His covenant was seen standing inside in His sanctuary; and there were flashes of lightning loud rumblings (blasts mutterings) peals of thunder an earthquake and a terrific hailstorm. [I Kings 8:1-6.]
Revelation,12,1,AND A great sign (wonder)--[warning of future events of ominous significance] appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun with the moon under her feet and with a crownlike garland (tiara) of twelve stars on her head.
Revelation,12,2,She was pregnant and she cried out in her birth pangs in the anguish of her delivery.
Revelation,12,3,Then another ominous sign (wonder) was seen in heaven: Behold a huge fiery-red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven kingly crowns (diadems) upon his heads.
Revelation,12,4,His tail swept [across the sky] and dragged down a third of the stars and flung them to the earth. And the dragon stationed himself in front of the woman who was about to be delivered so that he might devour her child as soon as she brought it forth.
Revelation,12,5,And she brought forth a male Child One Who is destined to shepherd (rule) all the nations with an iron staff (scepter) and her Child was caught up to God and to His throne.
Revelation,12,6,And the woman [herself] fled into the desert (wilderness) where she has a retreat prepared [for her] by God in which she is to be fed and kept safe for 1260 days (42 months; three and one-half years).
Revelation,12,7,Then war broke out in heaven; Michael and his angels went forth to battle with the dragon and the dragon and his angels fought.
Revelation,12,8,But they were defeated and there was no room found for them in heaven any longer.
Revelation,12,9,And the huge dragon was cast down and out--that age-old serpent who is called the Devil and Satan he who is the seducer (deceiver) of all humanity the world over; he was forced out and down to the earth and his angels were flung out along with him.
Revelation,12,10,Then I heard a strong (loud) voice in heaven saying Now it has come--the salvation and the power and the kingdom (the dominion the reign) of our God and the power (the sovereignty the authority) of His Christ (the Messiah); for the accuser of our brethren he who keeps bringing before our God charges against them day and night has been cast out!
Revelation,12,11,And they have overcome (conquered) him by means of the blood of the Lamb and by the utterance of their testimony for they did not love and cling to life even when faced with death [holding their lives cheap till they had to die for their witnessing].
Revelation,12,12,Therefore be glad (exult) O heavens and you that dwell in them! But woe to you O earth and sea for the devil has come down to you in fierce anger (fury) because he knows that he has [only] a short time [left]!
Revelation,12,13,And when the dragon saw that he was cast down to the earth he went in pursuit of the woman who had given birth to the male Child.
Revelation,12,14,But the woman was supplied with the two wings of a giant eagle so that she might fly from the presence of the serpent into the desert (wilderness) to the retreat where she is to be kept safe and fed for a time and times and half a time (three and one-half years or 1260 days).
Revelation,12,15,Then out of his mouth the serpent spouted forth water like a flood after the woman that she might be carried off with the torrent.
Revelation,12,16,But the earth came to the rescue of the woman and the ground opened its mouth and swallowed up the stream of water which the dragon had spouted from his mouth.
Revelation,12,17,So then the dragon was furious (enraged) at the woman and he went away to wage war on the remainder of her descendants--[on those] who obey God's commandments and who have the testimony of Jesus Christ [and adhere to it and bear witness to Him].
Revelation,13,1,[AS] I stood on the sandy beach I saw a beast coming up out of the sea with ten horns and seven heads. On his horns he had ten royal crowns (diadems) and blasphemous titles (names) on his heads.
Revelation,13,2,And the beast that I saw resembled a leopard but his feet were like those of a bear and his mouth was like that of a lion. And to him the dragon gave his [own] might and power and his [own] throne and great dominion.
Revelation,13,3,And one of his heads seemed to have a deadly wound. But his death stroke was healed; and the whole earth went after the beast in amazement and admiration.
Revelation,13,4,They fell down and paid homage to the dragon because he had bestowed on the beast all his dominion and authority; they also praised and worshiped the beast exclaiming Who is a match for the beast and Who can make war against him?
Revelation,13,5,And the beast was given the power of speech uttering boastful and blasphemous words and he was given freedom to exert his authority and to exercise his will during forty-two months (three and a half years).
Revelation,13,6,And he opened his mouth to speak slanders against God blaspheming His name and His abode [even vilifying] those who live in heaven.
Revelation,13,7,He was further permitted to wage war on God's holy people (the saints) and to overcome them. And power was given him to extend his authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation
Revelation,13,8,And all the inhabitants of the earth will fall down in adoration and pay him homage everyone whose name has not been recorded in the Book of Life of the Lamb that was slain [in sacrifice] from the foundation of the world.
Revelation,13,9,If anyone is able to hear let him listen:
Revelation,13,10,Whoever leads into captivity will himself go into captivity; if anyone slays with the sword with the sword must he be slain. Herein is [the call for] the patience and the faith and fidelity of the saints (God's people).
Revelation,13,11,Then I saw another beast rising up out of the land [itself]; he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke (roared) like a dragon.
Revelation,13,12,He exerts all the power and right of control of the former beast in his presence and causes the earth and those who dwell upon it to exalt and deify the first beast whose deadly wound was healed and to worship him.
Revelation,13,13,He performs great signs (startling miracles) even making fire fall from the sky to the earth in men's sight.
Revelation,13,14,And because of the signs (miracles) which he is allowed to perform in the presence of the [first] beast he deceives those who inhabit the earth commanding them to erect a statue (an image) in the likeness of the beast who was wounded by the [small] sword and still lived.
Revelation,13,15,And he is permitted [also] to impart the breath of life into the beast's image so that the statue of the beast could actually talk and cause to be put to death those who would not bow down and worship the image of the beast.
Revelation,13,16,Also he compels all [alike] both small and great both the rich and the poor both free and slave to be marked with an inscription [ stamped] on their right hands or on their foreheads
Revelation,13,17,So that no one will have power to buy or sell unless he bears the stamp (mark inscription) [that is] the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Revelation,13,18,Here is [room for] discernment [a call for the wisdom of interpretation]. Let anyone who has intelligence (penetration and insight enough) calculate the number of the beast for it is a human number [the number of a certain man]; his number is 666.
Revelation,14,1,THEN I looked and behold the Lamb stood on Mount Zion and with Him 144000 [men] who had His name and His Father's name inscribed on their foreheads.
Revelation,14,2,And I heard a voice from heaven like the sound of great waters and like the rumbling of mighty thunder; the voice I heard [seemed like the music] of harpists accompanying themselves on their harps.
Revelation,14,3,And they sang a new song before the throne [of God] and before the four living creatures and before the elders [of the heavenly Sanhedrin]. No one could learn [to sing] that song except the 144000 who had been ransomed (purchased redeemed) from the earth.
Revelation,14,4,These are they who have not defiled themselves by relations with women for they are [ pure as] virgins. These are they who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These are they who have been ransomed (purchased redeemed) from among men as the firstfruits for God and the Lamb.
Revelation,14,5,No lie was found to be upon their lips for they are blameless (spotless untainted without blemish) before the throne of God.
Revelation,14,6,Then I saw another angel flying in midair with an eternal Gospel (good news) to tell to the inhabitants of the earth to every race and tribe and language and people.
Revelation,14,7,And he cried with a mighty voice Revere God and give Him glory (honor and praise in worship) for the hour of His judgment has arrived. Fall down before Him; pay Him homage and adoration and worship Him Who created heaven and earth the sea and the springs (fountains) of water.
Revelation,14,8,Then another angel a second followed declaring Fallen fallen is Babylon the great! She who made all nations drink of the [maddening] wine of her passionate unchastity [ idolatry].
Revelation,14,9,Then another angel a third followed them saying with a mighty voice Whoever pays homage to the beast and his statue and permits the [beast's] stamp (mark inscription) to be put on his forehead or on his hand
Revelation,14,10,He too shall [have to] drink of the wine of God's indignation and wrath poured undiluted into the cup of His anger; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.
Revelation,14,11,And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no respite (no pause no intermission no rest no peace) day or night--these who pay homage to the beast and to his image and whoever receives the stamp of his name upon him.
Revelation,14,12,Here [comes in a call for] the steadfastness of the saints [the patience the endurance of the people of God] those who [habitually] keep God's commandments and [their] faith in Jesus.
Revelation,14,13,Then I heard further [ perceiving the distinct words of] a voice from heaven saying Write this: Blessed (happy to be envied) are the dead from now on who die in the Lord! Yes blessed (happy to be envied indeed) says the Spirit [in] that they may rest from their labors for their works (deeds) do follow (attend accompany) them!
Revelation,14,14,Again I looked and behold [I saw] a white cloud and sitting on the cloud One resembling a Son of Man with a crown of gold on His head and a sharp scythe (sickle) in His hand.
Revelation,14,15,And another angel came out of the temple sanctuary calling with a mighty voice to Him Who was sitting upon the cloud Put in Your scythe and reap for the hour has arrived to gather the harvest for the earth's crop is fully ripened.
Revelation,14,16,So He Who was sitting upon the cloud swung His scythe (sickle) on the earth and the earth's crop was harvested.
Revelation,14,17,Then another angel came out of the temple [sanctuary] in heaven and he also carried a sharp scythe (sickle).
Revelation,14,18,And another angel came forth from the altar [the angel] who has authority and power over fire and he called with a loud cry to him who had the sharp scythe (sickle) Put forth your scythe and reap the fruitage of the vine of the earth for its grapes are entirely ripe.
Revelation,14,19,So the angel swung his scythe on the earth and stripped the grapes and gathered the vintage from the vines of the earth and cast it into the huge winepress of God's indignation and wrath.
Revelation,14,20,And [the grapes in] the winepress were trodden outside the city and blood poured from the winepress [reaching] as high as horses' bridles for a distance of 1600 stadia (about 200 miles).
Revelation,15,1,THEN I saw another wonder (sign token symbol) in heaven great and marvelous [warning of events of ominous significance]: There were seven angels bringing seven plagues (afflictions calamities) which are the last for with them God's wrath (indignation) is completely expressed [reaches its climax and is ended].
Revelation,15,2,Then I saw what seemed to be a glassy sea blended with fire and those who had come off victorious from the beast and from his statue and from the number corresponding to his name were standing beside the glassy sea with harps of God in their hands.
Revelation,15,3,And they sang the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb saying Mighty and marvelous are Your works O Lord God the Omnipotent! Righteous (just) and true are Your ways O Sovereign of the ages (King of the nations)!
Revelation,15,4,Who shall not reverence and glorify Your name O Lord [giving You honor and praise in worship]? For You only are holy. All the nations shall come and pay homage and adoration to You for Your just judgments (Your righteous sentences and deeds) have been made known and displayed.
Revelation,15,5,After this I looked and the sanctuary of the tent of the testimony in heaven was thrown open
Revelation,15,6,And there came out of the temple sanctuary the seven angels bringing the seven plagues (afflictions calamities). They were arrayed in pure gleaming linen and around their breasts they wore golden girdles.
Revelation,15,7,And one of the four living creatures [then] gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath and indignation of God Who lives forever and ever (in the eternities of the eternities).
Revelation,15,8,And the sanctuary was filled with smoke from the glory (the radiance the splendor) of God and from His might and power and no one was able to go into the sanctuary until the seven plagues (afflictions calamities) of the seven angels were ended. [I Kings 8:10; Isa. 6:4; Ezek. 44:4.]
Revelation,16,1,THEN I heard a mighty voice from the temple sanctuary saying to the seven angels Go and empty out on the earth the seven bowls of God's wrath and indignation.
Revelation,16,2,So the first [angel] went and emptied his bowl on the earth and foul and painful ulcers (sores) came on the people who were marked with the stamp of the beast and who did homage to his image.
Revelation,16,3,The second [angel] emptied his bowl into the sea and it turned into blood like that of a corpse [thick corrupt ill-smelling and disgusting] and every living thing that was in the sea perished.
Revelation,16,4,Then the third [angel] emptied out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water and they turned into (became) blood.
Revelation,16,5,And I also heard the angel of the waters say Righteous (just) are You in these Your decisions and judgments You Who are and were O Holy One!
Revelation,16,6,Because they have poured out the blood of Your people (the saints) and the prophets and You have given them blood to drink. Such is their due [they deserve it]!
Revelation,16,7,And [from] the altar I heard [the] cry Yes Lord God the Omnipotent Your judgments (sentences decisions) are true and just and righteous!
Revelation,16,8,Then the fourth [angel] emptied out his bowl upon the sun and it was permitted to burn (scorch) humanity with [fierce glowing] heat (fire).
Revelation,16,9,People were severely burned (scorched) by the fiery heat and they reviled and blasphemed the name of God Who has control of these plagues and they did not repent of their sins [felt no regret contrition and compunction for their waywardness refusing to amend their ways] to give Him glory.
Revelation,16,10,Then the fifth [angel] emptied his bowl on the throne of the beast and his kingdom was [plunged] in darkness; and people gnawed their tongues for the torment [of their excruciating distress and severe pain]
Revelation,16,11,And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their anguish and their ulcers (sores) and they did not deplore their wicked deeds or repent [for what they had done].
Revelation,16,12,Then the sixth [angel] emptied his bowl on the mighty river Euphrates and its water was dried up to make ready a road for [the coming of] the kings of the east (from the rising sun).
Revelation,16,13,And I saw three loathsome spirits like frogs [leaping] from the mouth of the dragon and from the mouth of the beast and from the mouth of the false prophet.
Revelation,16,14,For really they are the spirits of demons that perform signs (wonders miracles). And they go forth to the rulers and leaders all over the world to gather them together for war on the great day of God the Almighty.
Revelation,16,15,Behold I am going to come like a thief! Blessed (happy to be envied) is he who stays awake (alert) and who guards his clothes so that he may not be naked and [have the shame of being] seen exposed!
Revelation,16,16,And they gathered them together at the place which in Hebrew is called Armageddon. [II Kings 9:27.]
Revelation,16,17,Then the seventh [angel] emptied out his bowl into the air and a mighty voice came out of the sanctuary of heaven from the throne [of God] saying It is done! [It is all over it is all accomplished it has come!]
Revelation,16,18,And there followed lightning flashes loud rumblings peals of thunder and a tremendous earthquake; nothing like it has ever occurred since men dwelt on the earth so severe and far-reaching was that earthquake.
Revelation,16,19,The mighty city was broken into three parts and the cities of the nations fell. And God kept in mind mighty Babylon to make her drain the cup of His furious wrath and indignation.
Revelation,16,20,And every island fled and no mountains could be found.
Revelation,16,21,And great (excessively oppressive) hailstones as heavy as a talent [between fifty and sixty pounds] of immense size fell from the sky on the people; and men blasphemed God for the plague of the hail so very great was [the torture] of that plague.
Revelation,17,1,ONE OF the seven angels who had the seven bowls then came and spoke to me saying Come with me! I will show you the doom (sentence judgment) of the great harlot (idolatress) who is seated on many waters
Revelation,17,2,[She] with whom the rulers of the earth have joined in prostitution (idolatry) and with the wine of whose immorality (idolatry) the inhabitants of the earth have become intoxicated.
Revelation,17,3,And [the angel] bore me away [rapt] in the Spirit into a desert (wilderness) and I saw a woman seated on a scarlet beast that was all covered with blasphemous titles (names) and he had seven heads and ten horns.
Revelation,17,4,The woman was robed in purple and scarlet and bedecked with gold precious stones and pearls [and she was] holding in her hand a golden cup full of the accursed offenses and the filth of her lewdness and vice.
Revelation,17,5,And on her forehead there was inscribed a name of mystery [with a secret symbolic meaning]: Babylon the great the mother of prostitutes (idolatresses) and of the filth and atrocities and abominations of the earth.
Revelation,17,6,I also saw that the woman was drunk [drunk] with the blood of the saints (God's people) and the blood of the martyrs [who witnessed] for Jesus. And when I saw her I was utterly amazed and wondered greatly.
Revelation,17,7,But the angel said to me Why do you wonder? I will explain to you the [secret symbolic meaning of the] mystery of the woman as well as of the beast having the seven heads and ten horns that carries her.
Revelation,17,8,The beast that you saw [once] was but [now] is no more and he is going to come up out of the Abyss (the bottomless pit) and proceed to go to perdition. And the inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been recorded in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world will be astonished when they look at the beast because he [once] was but [now] is no more and he is [yet] to come.
Revelation,17,9,This calls for a mind [to consider that is packed] with wisdom and intelligence [it is something for a particular mode of thinking and judging of thoughts feelings and purposes]. The seven heads are seven hills upon which the woman is sitting;
Revelation,17,10,And they are also seven kings five of whom have fallen one still exists [and is reigning]; the other [the seventh] has not yet appeared and when he does arrive he must stay [but] a brief time.
Revelation,17,11,And as for the beast that [once] was but now is no more he [himself] is an eighth ruler (king head) but he is of the seven and belongs to them and he goes to perdition.
Revelation,17,12,Also the ten horns that you observed are ten rulers (kings) who have as yet received no royal dominion but together they are to receive power and authority as rulers for a single hour along with the beast.
Revelation,17,13,These have one common policy (opinion purpose) and they deliver their power and authority to the beast.
Revelation,17,14,They will wage war against the Lamb and the Lamb will triumph over them; for He is Lord of lords and King of kings--and those with Him and on His side are chosen and called [elected] and loyal and faithful followers.
Revelation,17,15,And [the angel further] said to me The waters that you observed where the harlot is seated are races and multitudes and nations and dialects (languages).
Revelation,17,16,And the ten horns that you saw they and the beast will [be the very ones to] hate the harlot (the idolatrous woman); they will make her cheerless (bereaved desolate) and they will strip her and eat up her flesh and utterly consume her with fire.
Revelation,17,17,For God has put it into their hearts to carry out His own purpose by acting in harmony in surrendering their royal power and authority to the beast until the prophetic words (intentions and promises) of God shall be fulfilled.
Revelation,17,18,And the woman that you saw is herself the great city which dominates and controls the rulers and the leaders of the earth.
Revelation,18,1,THEN I saw another angel descending from heaven possessing great authority and the earth was illuminated with his radiance and splendor.
Revelation,18,2,And he shouted with a mighty voice She is fallen! Mighty Babylon is fallen! She has become a resort and dwelling place for demons a dungeon haunted by every loathsome spirit an abode for every filthy and detestable bird.
Revelation,18,3,For all nations have drunk the wine of her passionate unchastity and the rulers and leaders of the earth have joined with her in committing fornication (idolatry) and the businessmen of the earth have become rich with the wealth of her excessive luxury and wantonness.
Revelation,18,4,I then heard another voice from heaven saying Come out from her my people so that you may not share in her sins neither participate in her plagues.
Revelation,18,5,For her iniquities (her crimes and transgressions) are piled up as high as heaven and God has remembered her wickedness and [her] crimes [and calls them up for settlement].
Revelation,18,6,Repay to her what she herself has paid [to others] and double [her doom] in accordance with what she has done. Mix a double portion for her in the cup she mixed [for others].
Revelation,18,7,To the degree that she glorified herself and reveled in her wantonness [living deliciously and luxuriously] to that measure impose on her torment and anguish and tears and mourning. Since in her heart she boasts I am not a widow; as a queen [on a throne] I sit and I shall never see suffering or experience sorrow--
Revelation,18,8,So shall her plagues (afflictions calamities) come thick upon her in a single day pestilence and anguish and sorrow and famine; and she shall be utterly consumed (burned up with fire) for mighty is the Lord God Who judges her.
Revelation,18,9,And the rulers and leaders of the earth who joined her in her immorality (idolatry) and luxuriated with her will weep and beat their breasts and lament over her when they see the smoke of her conflagration.
Revelation,18,10,They will stand a long way off in terror of her torment and they will cry Woe and alas the great city the mighty city Babylon! In one single hour how your doom (judgment) has overtaken you!
Revelation,18,11,And earth's businessmen will weep and grieve over her because no one buys their freight (cargo) any more.
Revelation,18,12,Their merchandise is of gold silver precious stones and pearls; of fine linen purple silk and scarlet [stuffs]; all kinds of scented wood all sorts of articles of ivory all varieties of objects of costly woods bronze iron and marble;
Revelation,18,13,Of cinnamon spices incense ointment and perfume and frankincense of wine and olive oil fine flour and wheat; of cattle and sheep horses and conveyances; and of slaves (the bodies) and souls of men!
Revelation,18,14,The ripe fruits and delicacies for which your soul longed have gone from you and all your luxuries and dainties your elegance and splendor are lost to you never again to be recovered or experienced!
Revelation,18,15,The dealers who handled these articles who grew wealthy through their business with her will stand a long way off in terror of her doom and torment weeping and grieving aloud and saying
Revelation,18,16,Alas alas for the great city that was robed in fine linen in purple and scarlet bedecked and glittering with gold with precious stones and with pearls!
Revelation,18,17,Because in one [single] hour all the vast wealth has been destroyed (wiped out). And all ship captains and pilots navigators and all who live by seafaring the crews and all who ply their trade on the sea stood a long way off
Revelation,18,18,And exclaimed as they watched the smoke of her burning What city could be compared to the great city!
Revelation,18,19,And they threw dust on their heads as they wept and grieved exclaiming Woe and alas for the great city where all who had ships on the sea grew rich [through her extravagance] from her great wealth! In one single hour she has been destroyed and has become a desert!
Revelation,18,20,Rejoice (celebrate) over her O heaven! O saints (people of God) and apostles and prophets because God has executed vengeance for you upon her!
Revelation,18,21,Then a single powerful angel took up a boulder like a great millstone and flung it into the sea crying With such violence shall Babylon the great city be hurled down to destruction and shall never again be found.
Revelation,18,22,And the sound of harpists and minstrels and flute players and trumpeters shall never again be heard in you and no skilled artisan of any craft shall ever again be found in you and the sound of the millstone shall never again be heard in you.
Revelation,18,23,And never again shall the light of a lamp shine in you and the voice of bridegroom and bride shall never be heard in you again; for your businessmen were the great and prominent men of the earth and by your magic spells and poisonous charm all nations were led astray (seduced and deluded).
Revelation,18,24,And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all those who have been slain (slaughtered) on earth.
Revelation,19,1,AFTER THIS I heard what sounded like a mighty shout of a great crowd in heaven exclaiming Hallelujah (praise the Lord)! Salvation and glory (splendor and majesty) and power (dominion and authority) [belong] to our God!
Revelation,19,2,Because His judgments (His condemnation and punishment His sentences of doom) are true and sound and just and upright. He has judged (convicted pronounced sentence and doomed) the great and notorious harlot (idolatress) who corrupted and demoralized and poisoned the earth with her lewdness and adultery (idolatry). And He has avenged (visited on her the penalty for) the blood of His servants at her hand.
Revelation,19,3,And again they shouted Hallelujah (praise the Lord)! The smoke of her [burning] shall continue to ascend forever and ever (through the eternities of the eternities).
Revelation,19,4,Then the twenty-four elders [of the heavenly Sanhedrin] and the four living creatures fell prostrate and worshiped [paying divine honors to] God Who sits on the throne saying Amen! Hallelujah (praise the Lord)!
Revelation,19,5,Then from the throne there came a voice saying Praise our God all you servants of His you who reverence Him both small and great!
Revelation,19,6,After that I heard what sounded like the shout of a vast throng like the boom of many pounding waves and like the roar of terrific and mighty peals of thunder exclaiming Hallelujah (praise the Lord)! For now the Lord our God the Omnipotent (the All-Ruler) reigns!
Revelation,19,7,Let us rejoice and shout for joy [exulting and triumphant]! Let us celebrate and ascribe to Him glory and honor for the marriage of the Lamb [at last] has come and His bride has prepared herself.
Revelation,19,8,She has been permitted to dress in fine (radiant) linen dazzling and white--for the fine linen is (signifies represents) the righteousness (the upright just and godly living deeds and conduct and right standing with God) of the saints (God's holy people).
Revelation,19,9,Then [the angel] said to me Write this down: Blessed (happy to be envied) are those who are summoned (invited called) to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he said to me [further] These are the true words (the genuine and exact declarations) of God.
Revelation,19,10,Then I fell prostrate at his feet to worship (to pay divine honors) to him but he [restrained me] and said Refrain! [You must not do that!] I am [only] another servant with you and your brethren who have [accepted and hold] the testimony borne by Jesus. Worship God! For the substance (essence) of the truth revealed by Jesus is the spirit of all prophecy [the vital breath the inspiration of all inspired preaching and interpretation of the divine will and purpose including both mine and yours].
Revelation,19,11,After that I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse [appeared]! The One Who was riding it is called Faithful (Trustworthy Loyal Incorruptible Steady) and True and He passes judgment and wages war in righteousness (holiness justice and uprightness).
Revelation,19,12,His eyes [blaze] like a flame of fire and on His head are many kingly crowns (diadems); and He has a title (name) inscribed which He alone knows or can understand.
Revelation,19,13,He is dressed in a robe dyed by dipping in blood and the title by which He is called is The Word of God.
Revelation,19,14,And the troops of heaven clothed in fine linen dazzling and clean followed Him on white horses.
Revelation,19,15,From His mouth goes forth a sharp sword with which He can smite (afflict strike) the nations; and He will shepherd and control them with a staff (scepter rod) of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath and indignation of God the All-Ruler (the Almighty the Omnipotent).
Revelation,19,16,And on His garment (robe) and on His thigh He has a name (title) inscribed KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.
Revelation,19,17,Then I saw a single angel stationed in the sun's light and with a mighty voice he shouted to all the birds that fly across the sky Come gather yourselves together for the great supper of God
Revelation,19,18,That you may feast on the flesh of rulers the flesh of generals and captains the flesh of powerful and mighty men the flesh of horses and their riders and the flesh of all humanity both free and slave both small and great!
Revelation,19,19,Then I saw the beast and the rulers and leaders of the earth with their troops mustered to go into battle and make war against Him Who is mounted on the horse and against His troops.
Revelation,19,20,And the beast was seized and overpowered and with him the false prophet who in his presence had worked wonders and performed miracles by which he led astray those who had accepted or permitted to be placed upon them the stamp (mark) of the beast and those who paid homage and gave divine honors to his statue. Both of them were hurled alive into the fiery lake that burns and blazes with brimstone.
Revelation,19,21,And the rest were killed with the sword that issues from the mouth of Him Who is mounted on the horse and all the birds fed ravenously and glutted themselves with their flesh.
Revelation,20,1,THEN I saw an angel descending from heaven; he was holding the key of the Abyss (the bottomless pit) and a great chain was in his hand.
Revelation,20,2,And he gripped and overpowered the dragon that old serpent [of primeval times] who is the devil and Satan and [securely] bound him for a thousand years.
Revelation,20,3,Then he hurled him into the Abyss (the bottomless pit) and closed it and sealed it above him so that he should no longer lead astray and deceive and seduce the nations until the thousand years were at an end. After that he must be liberated for a short time.
Revelation,20,4,Then I saw thrones and sitting on them were those to whom authority to act as judges and to pass sentence was entrusted. Also I saw the souls of those who had been slain with axes [beheaded] for their witnessing to Jesus and [for preaching and testifying] for the Word of God and who had refused to pay homage to the beast or his statue and had not accepted his mark or permitted it to be stamped on their foreheads or on their hands. And they lived again and ruled with Christ (the Messiah) a thousand years.
Revelation,20,5,The remainder of the dead were not restored to life again until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection.
Revelation,20,6,Blessed (happy to be envied) and holy (spiritually whole of unimpaired innocence and proved virtue) is the person who takes part (shares) in the first resurrection! Over them the second death exerts no power or authority but they shall be ministers of God and of Christ (the Messiah) and they shall rule along with Him a thousand years.
Revelation,20,7,And when the thousand years are completed Satan will be released from his place of confinement
Revelation,20,8,And he will go forth to deceive and seduce and lead astray the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth--Gog and Magog--to muster them for war; their number is like the sand of the sea.
Revelation,20,9,And they swarmed up over the broad plain of the earth and encircled the fortress (camp) of God's people (the saints) and the beloved city; but fire descended from heaven and consumed them. [II Kings 1:10-12; Ezek. 38:2 22.]
Revelation,20,10,Then the devil who had led them astray [deceiving and seducing them] was hurled into the fiery lake of burning brimstone where the beast and false prophet were; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever (through the ages of the ages).
Revelation,20,11,Then I saw a great white throne and the One Who was seated upon it from Whose presence and from the sight of Whose face earth and sky fled away and no place was found for them.
Revelation,20,12,I [also] saw the dead great and small; they stood before the throne and books were opened. Then another book was opened which is [the Book] of Life. And the dead were judged (sentenced) by what they had done [ their whole way of feeling and acting their aims and endeavors] in accordance with what was recorded in the books.
Revelation,20,13,And the sea delivered up the dead who were in it death and Hades ( the state of death or disembodied existence) surrendered the dead in them and all were tried and their cases determined by what they had done [according to their motives aims and works].
Revelation,20,14,Then death and Hades ( the state of death or disembodied existence) were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death the lake of fire.
Revelation,20,15,And if anyone's [name] was not found recorded in the Book of Life he was hurled into the lake of fire.
Revelation,21,1,THEN I saw a new sky (heaven) and a new earth for the former sky and the former earth had passed away (vanished) and there no longer existed any sea.
Revelation,21,2,And I saw the holy city the new Jerusalem descending out of heaven from God all arrayed like a bride beautified and adorned for her husband;
Revelation,21,3,Then I heard a mighty voice from the throne and I perceived its distinct words saying See! The abode of God is with men and He will live (encamp tent) among them; and they shall be His people and God shall personally be with them and be their God.
Revelation,21,4,God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall be no more neither shall there be anguish (sorrow and mourning) nor grief nor pain any more for the old conditions and the former order of things have passed away.
Revelation,21,5,And He Who is seated on the throne said See! I make all things new. Also He said Record this for these sayings are faithful (accurate incorruptible and trustworthy) and true (genuine).
Revelation,21,6,And He [further] said to me It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I [Myself] will give water without price from the fountain (springs) of the water of Life.
Revelation,21,7,He who is victorious shall inherit all these things and I will be God to him and he shall be My son.
Revelation,21,8,But as for the cowards and the ignoble and the contemptible and the cravenly lacking in courage and the cowardly submissive and as for the unbelieving and faithless and as for the depraved and defiled with abominations and as for murderers and the lewd and adulterous and the practicers of magic arts and the idolaters (those who give supreme devotion to anyone or anything other than God) and all liars (those who knowingly convey untruth by word or deed)--[all of these shall have] their part in the lake that blazes with fire and brimstone. This is the second death.
Revelation,21,9,Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls filled with the seven final plagues (afflictions calamities) came and spoke to me. He said Come with me! I will show you the bride the Lamb's wife.
Revelation,21,10,Then in the Spirit He conveyed me away to a vast and lofty mountain and exhibited to me the holy (hallowed consecrated) city of Jerusalem descending out of heaven from God
Revelation,21,11,Clothed in God's glory [in all its splendor and radiance]. The luster of it resembled a rare and most precious jewel like jasper shining clear as crystal.
