Deuteronomy,28,53,"And you'll have to consume the offspring of your own flesh, the meat from your sons and daughters that the LORD your God has provided, during times of warfare and extreme difficulties when your enemies try to overpower you. {body: Hebrew: belly}"
Deuteronomy,28,54,"When a dude who's all sensitive and stuff, like super soft and delicate, starts giving his bro the stink eye and being mean to his wifey and even their kiddos, the ones he's gonna leave behind... Yeah, things are not looking good."
Deuteronomy,28,55,"So he won't have to resort to eating his own children because he'll be completely desperate during the siege, when your enemies bring you to your knees in every city."
Deuteronomy,28,56,"The sensitive and fragile woman among you, who's afraid to even step on the ground because she's so dainty and gentle, will give her husband, her son, and her daughter the stink eye."
Deuteronomy,28,57,"And she will eat her own babies and afterbirth, because of the desperate situation when the enemy puts you under siege and causes you great distress."
Deuteronomy,28,58,"If you don't follow all the rules written in this book, so you can show respect to this awesome and intimidating name, THE LORD THY GOD;"
Deuteronomy,28,59,"Then God's gonna bring some crazy plagues upon you and your offspring, like seriously gnarly ones that last a long time and make you super sick."
Deuteronomy,28,60,"And on top of that, you're gonna get hit with all the diseases from Egypt that you were so scared of, and they're gonna stick to you, like, forever."
Deuteronomy,28,61,And God will bring upon you all sorts of sickness and plagues that are not even mentioned in this law until you are completely wiped out.
Deuteronomy,28,62,"And y'all gonna be seriously outnumbered, even though you used to be as lit as the stars in the sky! It's all because you straight up refused to listen to the Almighty himself, the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,28,63,"And so, it's gonna go down like this: just like the LORD was all hyped up to do good things for you and help you grow, now He's gonna be hyped up to wipe you out and bring you down. You're gonna get kicked out of the land you're trying to claim."
Deuteronomy,28,64,"God's gonna like totally spread you out all over the world, from one side to the other. And you're gonna end up worshiping these other gods made of wood and stone, who your ancestors never even knew, dude."
Deuteronomy,28,65,"And you won't catch a break among these nations, your feet won't find any peace. Instead, the LORD will make your heart race, your vision weak, and your mind filled with sorrow."
Deuteronomy,28,66,"And your life will be filled with uncertainty; you'll be constantly worried day and night, with no guarantee of your safety:"
Deuteronomy,28,67,"When morning comes, you'll be like 'Ugh, I wish it was already night!' and when night falls, you'll be like Mann, I wish it was already morning!' because you'll be scared out of your mind and the things you'll witness will be straight up terrifying."
Deuteronomy,28,68,"God's gonna take you back to Egypt in some ships, just like I told you before, and once you're there, you'll never see your homeland again. Get ready to be sold as slaves to your enemies, and good luck finding anyone who'll save you."
Deuteronomy,29,1,"Yo, listen up! These words right here, they're all about the covenant that the LORD gave to Moses for the Israelite peeps in Moab. It's like, a super important deal, right? It's the real deal, apart from the one made back in Horeb, you feel me?"
Deuteronomy,29,2,"So Moses gathered all of Israel and was like, 'Listen up guys! Y'all saw firsthand all the epic stuff that the Lord pulled off in Egypt, wrecking Pharaoh and his whole crew, and taking over the whole land and everything! It was wild, dude! Like, no joke."
Deuteronomy,29,3,"Okay, listen up fam! You've witnessed some epic trials that have tested your faith, along with mind-blowing signs and miracles, no cap!"
Deuteronomy,29,4,"But, like, God hasn't given you the ability to truly understand, see, or hear what's real up until now."
Deuteronomy,29,5,"I've totally guided you for, like, 40 years in this wild journey. And dude, your clothes didn't even get worn out, and your kicks stayed fresh on your feet the whole time."
Deuteronomy,29,6,"You haven't even had bread or sipped on wine or any hard drinks, just so you can recognize that I'm the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,29,7,"So, when we arrived at this spot, Sihon, the king of Heshbon, and Og, the king of Bashan, decided to come and fight us. And guess what? We totally crushed them!"
Deuteronomy,29,8,"So, like, we totally snagged their land and were, like, 'Yo, Reubenites, Gadites, and half of Manasseh, this is gonna be your spot now, for real.'"
Deuteronomy,29,9,"So, like, make sure you totally stick to the terms of this covenant and actually do what it says. That way, you'll totally succeed and thrive in everything you do."
Deuteronomy,29,10,"Today, all of you are here in front of the LORD your God - the leaders of your groups, the wise ones, and those in charge, along with all the guys from Israel."
Deuteronomy,29,11,"Your squad, your bae, and the new peeps you got in your crew, from the one who chops your firewood to the one who grabs your drink:"
Deuteronomy,29,12,"It's like, you gotta make this tight agreement with the LORD your God, and like, get all oath-y and stuff, 'cause the LORD your God is totally down to make this pact with you today. {enter: It means pass, FYI}"
Deuteronomy,29,13,"So that you could be his chosen crew today, and he can be your ultimate squad goals just like he promised your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. So legit, right?"
Deuteronomy,29,14,"I'm not just making this covenant and promise with you, fam; it's for everyone too, you feel me?"
Deuteronomy,29,15,"But with the squad that's right here with us today, before the LORD our God, and also with those who aren't present with us today:"
Deuteronomy,29,16,"So, like, you all know how we were living in Egypt for a while, right? And, like, how we had to go through all these other countries along the way?"
Deuteronomy,29,17,"And y'all have peeped the straight up whack stuff they worshiped, like wood and stone statues, even silver and gold. Can you believe they actually thought that junk was divine? Smh 🙄"
Deuteronomy,29,18,"Yo, listen up, fam! We don't want any of y'all, whether you're a guy, girl, part of a crew, or reppin' a whole tribe, to be out here strayin' from the Almighty, our God. Don't even think about worshipin' the gods that these other nations are into. We ain't tryna have any toxic vibes or negativity takin' root among us, ya feel me?"
Deuteronomy,29,19,"And when he hears this curse, he thinks to himself, saying, I'll be fine, even if I keep following my own stubborn desires and pursue pleasure: {stubbornness: or, stubbornness} {drunkenness...: Hebrew: the drunk to the thirsty}"
Deuteronomy,29,20,"The Big Guy Upstairs won't cut him any slack, in fact, he's gonna be real ticked off and jealous at that dude. All the bad stuff promised in this book's gonna hit him hard, and his name's gonna be erased from this whole heaven deal."
Deuteronomy,29,21,"And the LORD will single him out for bad luck from all the tribes of Israel, in line with all the curses written in this book of the law: {are: Heb. is}"
Deuteronomy,29,22,"And when the future fam and the random peeps from distant places peep the messed up things happening in that land and all the sicknesses the LORD brought upon it, they gonna be like, 'Daaaang, that's rough!'"
Deuteronomy,29,23,"Yo, the whole land there is totally messed up - we're talking brimstone, salt, and fire. It's like a barren wasteland, no crops, no grass, nada. Just like when God destroyed Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim in a fit of anger and wrath, you know?"
Deuteronomy,29,24,"Bruh, all the countries gonna be like, Why the Lord be doin' this to the land? What's up with all this intense anger?"
Deuteronomy,29,25,"So people will be like, 'Yo, it's because they straight up ditched the agreement their ancestors made with the LORD God when he brought them out of Egypt.'"
Deuteronomy,29,26,"Because they went and started stanning other gods, totally simping for them. These gods were like total strangers to them, like, they didn't have any connections or anything. God was like, 'Yo, I didn't even offer those gods to them, like, no part of them whatsoever.'"
Deuteronomy,29,27,But God was really mad at this place and decided to make it go through all the awful stuff mentioned in this book:
Deuteronomy,29,28,"Then God, like, totally got fed up with them and straight-up kicked them out of their land, all furious and raging with intense anger. He literally tossed them into another place, just like, you know, how things are these days."
Deuteronomy,29,29,"God keeps the secret stuff to Himself, but He shares what we need to know with us and our generation forever, so we can live by His law."
Deuteronomy,30,1,"And yo, listen up, when all this stuff starts going down, the good and the bad that I've laid out for you, you gonna remember it all no matter where you at, 'cause the LORD your God be taking you places."
Deuteronomy,30,2,"And you'll go back to vibing with the Lord your God and doing everything He tells you to do, no cap. Like, me and your squad, we're all in this with our whole hearts and souls, you know?"
Deuteronomy,30,3,"So, like, God is gonna totally free you from being held captive, and He's gonna show you mad love and bring you back from wherever He's spread you out across the nations."
Deuteronomy,30,4,"If any of your squad gets scattered to the ends of the universe, trust that the LORD your God will come to their rescue and bring them back home."
Deuteronomy,30,5,"And God will totally hook you up by bringing you to the land your ancestors owned. It's gonna be all yours, no doubt. Plus, He's gonna bless you like crazy and make you even more successful than your ancestors ever were!"
Deuteronomy,30,6,"And God is gonna change your heart, and the hearts of your future fam, so you'll be all about loving God with everything inside you, so you can truly live your best life."
Deuteronomy,30,7,"And God's got your back, fam. He's gonna hit up all your haters and enemies with a major reality check. They thought they could mess with you? Nah, fam. God's about to make them pay for all the ways they harassed you."
Deuteronomy,30,8,"And you gotta like, come back and listen to what the LORD is saying, and like, do everything He's telling you to do right now, ya know?"
Deuteronomy,30,9,"And God, like, totally gonna bless you with abundance in everything you do, yo! Your fam, your livestock, and your land gonna be hella fruitful, for real. God's gonna be stoked and happy 'bout it, just like he was with your ancestors, no cap!"
Deuteronomy,30,10,"If you listen to what the LORD your God says and follow his rules that are written in this book of the law, and if you fully dedicate yourself to the LORD your God with all your heart and soul."
Deuteronomy,30,11,"Yo, this rule that I'm giving you today, it ain't some secret info or really hard to find."
Deuteronomy,30,12,"It's not some far-out thing, like, who's gonna go all the way to heaven and bring it down to us so we can hear it and do it, you know?"
Deuteronomy,30,13,"It's not even far away that you'll be like, who's gonna cross the sea and bring it to us so we can hear and do it?"
Deuteronomy,30,14,"But like, the word is super close to you, like right in your mouth and in your heart, so you can totally live it out."
Deuteronomy,30,15,"Listen up, fam! Today, I'm giving you two choices: life and blessings, or death and bad vibes."
Deuteronomy,30,16,"So, like, God's telling you today to be all about loving Him, rocking His ways, and staying true to His commandments, statutes, and judgments. If you do that, you'll totally thrive and grow, and God will bless you big time in the place you're headed to own!"
Deuteronomy,30,17,"If you stop listening and start following other paths, like worshiping other gods, you're gonna be off track."
Deuteronomy,30,18,"Listen up fam, I gotta drop some knowledge on you. If you keep acting like this, you're seriously gonna mess things up and your time in this place is gonna be cut short. You know, that land you're about to head into after crossing the Jordan? Yeah, it's not gonna last long if you keep up with this behavior, just sayin'."
Deuteronomy,30,19,"Yo, listen up! I wanna make something crystal clear here, so pay attention. Heaven and earth are my witnesses as we speak. I'm giving you a major choice: life or death, blessings or curses. I strongly urge you to go with life, so that you and your future fam can thrive and keep on living!"
Deuteronomy,30,20,"So you can love the LORD your God, and so you can listen to what he says, and so you can stick by him: because he's your life, and he'll give you a long, happy life. And so you can live in the land that the LORD promised to your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
Deuteronomy,31,1,So Moses went and started dropping these words to all of Israel.
Deuteronomy,31,2,"So, like, I'm 120 years old today and I'm totally not able to go in and out anymore, you know? The LORD also told me that I can't cross the Jordan River, like, at all."
Deuteronomy,31,3,"Your God, the LORD, will totally wreck those nations for you, and you'll totally take over their land. Joshua will lead the way, just like the LORD promised."
Deuteronomy,31,4,"God's gonna treat them the same way He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and their land, which He totally wrecked."
Deuteronomy,31,5,"And God will totally let them have it, so you can unleash your power and wreck them just like I commanded you to do, fam."
Deuteronomy,31,6,"Stay confident and fearless, don't stress about them: 'cause the LORD your God, He's the one rollin' by your side; He won't dip out on you, or leave you hangin'."
Deuteronomy,31,7,"So Moses hit up Joshua, and straight up told him in front of everyone in Israel, 'Yo, be hella strong and brave, 'cause you gotta roll with this squad to the land that the LORD promised to our ancestors, and you gonna help them claim it.'"
Deuteronomy,31,8,"Yo, the LORD, He's the one who's always got your back, you know? He's got your front, too - always leading the way. He's always gonna be right there with you, never gonna ditch ya or let you down. So, don't stress, don't be freaking out, just stay strong and keep moving forward."
Deuteronomy,31,9,So Moses wrote down these rules and gave them to the priests who were from the family of Levi. They were the ones in charge of carrying the sacred chest which held the agreement between God and his people. Moses also gave the rules to all the respected leaders of Israel.
Deuteronomy,31,10,"So Moses was like, 'Listen up, guys. Every seven years, when it's time for the big year of release and the feast of tabernacles,"
Deuteronomy,31,11,"When all of Israel gathers before the LORD your God at the spot they pick, you gotta read this law out loud for everyone to hear."
Deuteronomy,31,12,"Gather everybody - dudes, chicks, kids, and even those outsiders chillin' in your hood. We gotta get them all in one place so they can hear this important stuff, learn from it, and respect the LORD your God. It's key that they follow all the rules given in this law, no skipping out."
Deuteronomy,31,13,"And so that their kids, who don't have a clue, can hear and learn to respect the LORD your God as long as you're living in the land you're gonna take over after crossing the Jordan."
Deuteronomy,31,14,"Yo, Moses, listen up! The big man upstairs just told me that your time's almost up and you're about to kick the bucket. So here's the deal: grab Joshua and head over to the meeting spot in the tabernacle. God's got something important to say to him. Moses and Joshua did exactly that and showed up at the tabernacle."
Deuteronomy,31,15,"So, God showed up in the tabernacle as this cool cloud pillar thing, just chillin' right by the entrance. No biggie."
Deuteronomy,31,16,"Yo, Moses, listen up. You're gonna rest with your ancestors, and these people are gonna peep the other gods in the land they wander in. They're gonna ditch me and break the deal I made with 'em. #Betrayed"
Deuteronomy,31,17,"On that day, I'll get seriously ticked off at them. I'll ditch them and disappear, turning my back on them. They'll be totally screwed, facing a ton of bad stuff and problems. And they'll be all like, 'Dude, aren't we in deep because our God totally ditched us?'"
Deuteronomy,31,18,And I'm totally gonna ghost them on that day for all the messed up things they did by ditching me for other gods.
Deuteronomy,31,19,"So, like, write this dope song, you know? And make sure to teach it to all the kids of Israel, man! Get them to sing along and share it with others. This song will totally be a way for me to call out the children of Israel, you feel me?"
Deuteronomy,31,20,"So, like, when I finally get them to this rad land I promised their ancestors, full of epic stuff like milk and honey, and they've had their fill, they're gonna get all up in serving other gods, disrespecting me, and straight-up breaking our covenant."
Deuteronomy,31,21,"And it's gonna happen, when they go through a whole bunch of bad stuff and tough times, this song is gonna call them out and be like, 'I told you so'; they won't be able to forget it, even their kids will know it. I know exactly what they're thinking and planning, even before I bring them into the promised land like I promised."
Deuteronomy,31,22,So Moses wrote this lit song on the same day and dropped some knowledge to the children of Israel.
Deuteronomy,31,23,"Then God told Joshua, son of Nun, to be strong and brave, because he was the one who would lead the Israelites into the land that He promised them. And God promised to be there with Joshua every step of the way."
Deuteronomy,31,24,"So, like, when Moses finished writing down all the words of the law in a book, it was totally a done deal, ya know?"
Deuteronomy,31,25,"Moses told the Levites, who were carrying the sacred ark of the Lord's covenant, this:"
Deuteronomy,31,26,"Yo, grab this lit book of the law and slide it into the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, you know? It's gotta be there to, like, testify against you."
Deuteronomy,31,27,"Like, I totally get that you guys are rebellious and stubborn. But seriously, check it out: even though I'm still alive and kicking today, you've already been so rebellious towards the LORD. Can you imagine how much worse it's gonna get after I'm gone?"
Deuteronomy,31,28,"Yo, bring all the OGs and the squad leaders from your tribes to me, 'cause I gotta drop some knowledge in their ears and make heaven and earth bear witness to what I'm 'bout to say."
Deuteronomy,31,29,"Cuz I know that once I'm gone, y'all are gonna totally mess things up and stray from the path I've laid out for ya. And guess what? Bad stuff is gonna happen to you in the future. Why? 'Cause you're gonna go and anger the Big Guy up there with all the messed up things you're gonna do."
Deuteronomy,31,30,"So Moses like, totally dropped some sick rhymes in front of the whole Israel crew, spittin' the lyrics of this epic song, keepin' it going 'til the very end."
Deuteronomy,32,1,"Listen up, yo heavens, I got something to say! Earth, open your ears and catch the words coming from my mouth."
Deuteronomy,32,2,"My teachings will be like refreshing rain, my words will flow like gentle dew, spreading like a light drizzle on delicate plants and nourishing the grass with gentle showers."
Deuteronomy,32,3,"Yo, I'm boutta hype up the name of the LORD, so give mad props to our God. He's straight up amazing, fam."
Deuteronomy,32,4,"He's like the ultimate boss, his work is flawless: everything he does is fair and righteous. He's a totally real God, there's no shady stuff or mistakes with him, he's just straight-up righteous."
Deuteronomy,32,5,"Yo, they messed themselves up big time. They don't have the same vibes as his squad. They're a messed up and twisted generation. They got themselves into some shady stuff."
Deuteronomy,32,6,"Seriously, are you really gonna disrespect the LORD like that, bro? He's totally your OG, the one who's got your back. Like, he's the one who brought you into this world, made you who you are and got you all settled in, you know?"
Deuteronomy,32,7,"Yo, take a sec to rewind the clock and think about the good ol' days. Hit up your pops and he'll fill you in, or consult the OGs and they'll drop some knowledge on you. #Wisdom"
Deuteronomy,32,8,"Back in the day when the big guy upstairs divided up the world for everyone to claim their piece, he made sure to separate all the different peeps out there, basing it on how many of the chill dudes and dudettes from Israel there were."
Deuteronomy,32,9,"The Lord's got a special bond with his people, like Jacob is his main crew. It's like they're tight like a cord, you know?"
Deuteronomy,32,10,"He like, totally found him in this dry and barren wasteland, out there where it's all like, howling and stuff. And you know what? He didn't just leave him there, man! He guided him, taught him, and protected him like he was super important, you know, like the apple of his eye. {led: or, compassed}"
Deuteronomy,32,11,"Just like when an eagle shakes up her cozy nest, hovers over her adorable little ones, extends her wings wide, scoops them up, and carries them gently on her wings:"
Deuteronomy,32,12,"So, like, the LORD totally took the lead, and there was like, no other God hanging with him."
Deuteronomy,32,13,"He gave him a prime spot on the earth to flex, where he could feast on the finest crops. He hooked him up with sweet honey straight from the solid rock and fresh oil from the tough flinty rock."
Deuteronomy,32,14,"You had the best dairy products like butter from cows, milk from sheep, and the juiciest fat from lambs and rams of the fancy Bashan breed. Plus, you had goats and the finest wheat. And let's not forget the purest wine made from grapes - you drank it all!"
Deuteronomy,32,15,"But Jeshurun got way too comfortable and started acting all entitled: he got super big, super self-absorbed, and totally neglected God who brought him up and didn't value the Rock who saved him."
Deuteronomy,32,16,"They made him jealous by worshipping other gods, which made him furious with their disgusting acts."
Deuteronomy,32,17,"They were worshipping demons instead of God—following after unfamiliar gods, trendy ones that just popped up—who your ancestors never even considered fearing."
Deuteronomy,32,18,"You're totally forgetting about the OG who brought you into existence and straight-up neglecting the Creator who made you, man. SMH."
Deuteronomy,32,19,"And when the LORD saw that, He was totally disgusted because of the rude behavior of His kids, both sons and daughters. He was like, 'Ugh, seriously?'"
Deuteronomy,32,20,"And he was like, I'm gonna ghost them and see how things turn out for them, 'cause honestly, they're such a stubborn and unfaithful bunch of peeps, like they ain't got no trust in them at all, ya know?"
Deuteronomy,32,21,"They got me all jealous over something that ain't even God; they totally ticked me off with their useless stuff. So now, I'm gonna make them jealous by giving attention to people who don't even matter, and I'll really get under their skin by using a bunch of foolish individuals."
Deuteronomy,32,22,"My anger is like a raging fire that won't stop burning, it will even reach the deepest depths of the underworld! It will completely devour the earth and everything on it, even scorching the very foundations of the mighty mountains!"
Deuteronomy,32,23,I'm gonna unleash some serious chaos on them; I'll target them like an expert archer with my arrows.
Deuteronomy,32,24,"They'll be absolutely famished, scorched by scorching heat and utterly destroyed: I'll even unleash wild animal teeth upon them, along with venomous snakes that crawl in the dust. (heat: Hebrew for coals)"
Deuteronomy,32,25,"Like, there's gonna be this totally scary sword attack from the outside and lots of fear from the inside. It's gonna mess up both the young dudes and girls, even little babies and old peeps. It's gonna be so intense, man."
Deuteronomy,32,26,"I was like, 'Yo, I'm gonna send them to all the ends of the earth, erase any memory of them from everyone's minds.'"
Deuteronomy,32,27,"If it weren't for the fact that I'm scared of the haters, worried they might start acting all weird and claim that they're the ones in control, like, trying to take credit for everything while denying that God's behind it all. Like, seriously, they better recognize that it's all from the Most High!"
Deuteronomy,32,28,"Dude, seriously, they're a nation that's clueless and lacks any kind of wisdom or understanding, you know?"
Deuteronomy,32,29,"If only they were woke and actually got it, like, if they could just take a moment to reflect on how everything's gonna turn out for them in the end!"
Deuteronomy,32,30,"How can one person take on a thousand opponents, and two people defeat ten thousand enemies, unless their squad leader had their back, and the LORD had trapped their foes?"
Deuteronomy,32,31,"Their vibe ain't like ours, not even our haters can deny it."
Deuteronomy,32,32,"Their vine is like the sketchy vines of Sodom and the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes taste like extreme bitterness, and their clusters are seriously sour. It's even worse than your average vine, tbh."
Deuteronomy,32,33,"Their wine is like the ultimate gamer fuel and, bro, it's as deadly as a dragon's breath and the toxic bite of a venomous snake."
Deuteronomy,32,34,"Ayo, ain't this stash for real kept with me, all locked up and guarded among my precious things?"
Deuteronomy,32,35,"Vengeance is mine, and payback is coming their way; they're gonna slip up real soon. The day of their downfall is right around the corner, and the consequences are gonna catch up to them real quick."
Deuteronomy,32,36,God is gonna judge his people and show compassion to his servants when he sees that they're powerless and there's no one left to help.
Deuteronomy,32,37,"And he'll be like, 'Where tf are their gods, the ones they used to trust so much? Like, seriously, where's their solid rock now?'"
Deuteronomy,32,38,"Who had the privilege of feasting on the best part of their sacrifices and enjoying their finest wine? Let them step up and lend you a hand, providing you with support and a safe space."
Deuteronomy,32,39,"Yo, listen up fam, realize that it's me - straight up, no cap. Ain't no other deity rollin' with me. I got the power to take lives or give 'em, to cause pain or bring healing. Ain't nobody out there who can save you from my grip, ya feel me?"
Deuteronomy,32,40,"Because, like, I'm totally raising my hand to the heavens and declaring that I'll be around forever, no cap."
Deuteronomy,32,41,"Yo, if I sharpen my lit sword and grip it tight, you know I'm gonna serve some sweet justice. I'll totally get back at my enemies and show some love to those who straight up hate me."
Deuteronomy,32,42,"I'll totally make my arrows soaked in blood, and my sword will totally chow down on flesh; and it's gonna be because of all the bloodshed and the people I've captured. Revenge on our enemies has been happening right from the start, no doubt."
Deuteronomy,32,43,"Yo, nations! Get hyped with his squad cuz he's gonna make things right. He's gonna bring justice for his loyal crew and lay the smackdown on his enemies. Plus, he'll show mad love to his homeland and his peeps. Let's celebrate, fam! 🙌"
Deuteronomy,32,44,"So Moses showed up and dropped this sick song for everyone to vibe with, him and his bro Hoshea, aka Joshua."
Deuteronomy,32,45,So Moses finished talking to all of Israel with these words:
Deuteronomy,32,46,"Yo, listen up! Pay close attention to everything I'm about to say. It's super important. Make sure you pass it on to your kids and tell them to follow every single word of this law, no exceptions."
Deuteronomy,32,47,"This is actually pretty important for you, like it's your whole life we're talking about. By following this, you'll secure a long and fulfilling stay in the land you're about to conquer across the Jordan."
Deuteronomy,32,48,"And God was like, yo Moses, this right here be a message for you today, you feel me?"
Deuteronomy,32,49,"Yo, head up to this lit mountain called Abarim, more specifically Mount Nebo. It's in Moab, across from Jericho. Check out the dope land of Canaan, I'm giving it to the children of Israel as their new crib."
Deuteronomy,32,50,"And when it's your time to climb that mountain, you'll pass away and be united with your peeps, just like how Aaron, your bro, kicked the bucket on Mount Hor and joined his squad:"
Deuteronomy,32,51,"Yo, you messed up big time when you went against me with the Israelite crew at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin. You totally didn't give me the respect I deserve when we were chilling with the rest of the Israelite squad. {Meribah-Kadesh: or, there was some major drama at Kadesh}"
Deuteronomy,32,52,"But listen up, you'll catch a glimpse of the land, but you won't actually get to go there, it's for the children of Israel only."
Deuteronomy,33,1,"So, like, Moses, the dude chosen by God, gave this sick blessing to the Israelites before he kicked the bucket."

Deuteronomy,34,11,"Like, the LORD totally pulled off all these amazing miracles and stuff in Egypt, specifically to show Pharaoh and his peeps just how powerful He is, no joke. It was a total spectacle for all the Egyptians to witness, from the insane plagues to mind-blowing wonders - they couldn't deny His divine power, man."
Deuteronomy,34,12,"And through all that epic power, and all the intense awe that Moses displayed in front of all Israel."
Joshua,1,1,"So, like, after Moses, the true servant of the LORD, died, the LORD had a chat with Joshua, the son of Nun, who used to be Moses' right-hand guy, and here's what He said,"
Joshua,1,2,"Yo fam, Moses, my homie, he's passed on. So now, it's time for you to step up and lead the way. Gather everyone and let's cross over the Jordan river to the land that I'm gifting to the children of Israel, ya feel me?"
Joshua,1,3,"I promise you, wherever you set foot, I'm giving it to you just like I told Moses."
Joshua,1,4,"Yo, you gonna have this whole crazy big area, starting from the wilderness and Lebanon to the mighty Euphrates River, extending all the way to the land of the Hittites, and even reaching the rad great sea where the sun sets. It's gonna be your dope coast, bro."
Joshua,1,5,"No one will ever be able to come against you throughout your life, just like how I was with Moses, I'll be with you too. I won't let you down or abandon you."
Joshua,1,6,"Stay strong and confident, because it's up to you to divide the land among these people as their inheritance. I promised their ancestors that I would give them this land."
Joshua,1,7,"Just be strong and super brave, yo, and make sure you follow all the rules that Moses, my servant, told you about. Don't swerve to the right or left, like, stay on track! Then you'll be successful wherever you go, like killin' it in life, you know?"
Joshua,1,8,"Keep this rulebook on your tongue all the time and ponder over it day and night, so that you can follow everything written in it. By doing so, you'll find success and prosper in whatever you do."
Joshua,1,9,"Like, haven't I told you? Just be strong and confident, don't be scared or freaked out at all. 'Cause the LORD your God will totally be with you wherever you go, no matter what!"
Joshua,1,10,"So Joshua was like, 'Hey, officers of the people, listen up!'"
Joshua,1,11,"Yo, go tell everyone in the squad to get ready and stock up on food. In three days, we're crossing over the Jordan to claim the land that God promised us. It's all ours to own, bro!"
Joshua,1,12,"So Joshua spoke to the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh, saying,"
Joshua,1,13,"Yo, don't forget what Moses, the servant of the LORD, told ya! He was all like, 'The LORD your God has totally hooked you up with rest and this sick land, man.'"
Joshua,1,14,"So, like, all your wives, kids, and even your farm animals, they get to stay in the land that Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan river. But you guys, the strong and courageous ones, gotta cross over before your fellow peeps, all organized and ready to fight, and lend 'em a hand. {marshalled by five: Hebrew for, you know, all organized and stuff}"
Joshua,1,15,"Until the LORD has let your squad finally chillax, just like how He's let you all, and they've also snagged the area that the LORD your God is hooking them up with, then you can bounce back to your own territory and have a blast there. It's the same one that Moses, the LORD's ride-or-die servant, gave you on the side of the Jordan River where the sun rises."
Joshua,1,16,"And they responded to Joshua, like, 'Dude, whatever you tell us to do, we're totally down for it. And wherever you want us to go, we're totally there.'"
Joshua,1,17,"We totally listened to Moses and we'll totally listen to you too, as long as the LORD your God is on your side, just like he was with Moses!"
Joshua,1,18,"If someone decides to go against what you say and refuses to listen to your instructions, they will face serious consequences, even death. But don't worry, stay confident and brave in the face of challenges."
Joshua,2,1,"So Joshua, the son of Nun, decided to send two undercover dudes from Shittim to Jericho to, you know, scope out the land. They ended up chilling in a prostitute's crib called Rahab's place."
Joshua,2,2,"So, the king of Jericho was informed that some dudes from Israel snuck in here last night to check out the land."
Joshua,2,3,"So the king of Jericho hit up Rahab and was like, 'Yo, bring out those dudes who rolled up to your crib. They're here to scope out the whole area.'"
Joshua,2,4,"So the woman grabbed the two guys and hid them. She was like, 'Yo, these dudes showed up at my place, but I had no clue where they came from, man.'"
Joshua,2,5,"So, like, when the gate was about to close and it got all dark and stuff, the dudes went out. I have no idea where they went, but chase after them real fast, 'cause you'll totally catch up to them!"
Joshua,2,6,"So, she like totally led them to the rooftop and hid them with these stacks of flax that she had carefully arranged up there."
Joshua,2,7,"So the guys chased after them all the way to the Jordan River crossing, and as soon as those guys were outta there, they locked the gate."
Joshua,2,8,"And before they settled in, she went up to the roof to chill with them;"
Joshua,2,9,"And she said to the guys, I know that the LORD hooked you up with this land, and y'all got us shook. All the people living here are straight-up melting with fear because of you."
Joshua,2,10,"So, like, check it out, dudes. We've been hearing all about how the LORD totally made the water in the Red Sea disappear when you peeps were making your way out of Egypt. And, like, let's not forget about how you completely crushed those two kings of the Amorites, Sihon and Og, who were chilling on the other side of the Jordan River. Epic destruction, man!"
Joshua,2,11,"And once we had heard all this, we were shook to the core. No one had any bravery left in them because of you. It's because the LORD your God, he's the real deal up in heaven and down on earth."
Joshua,2,12,"Okay, listen up! Can you do me a favor and promise me, like, swear it by the LORD? You know, because I've been pretty cool to you. So, I'm just asking if you could also be cool to my family, ya know, show them some love and give me a clear sign that you're down with it!"
Joshua,2,13,"Yo, promise to keep my parents, siblings, and everything they own safe, and save us from any danger or death."
Joshua,2,14,"And the guys were like, hey, your secrets are safe with us. We promise that once we conquer the land, we'll totally be cool and honest with you. Trust us, we got your back. #Loyalty"
Joshua,2,15,"So she, like, totally lowered them down using a rope through the window since her crib was on the city wall and she lived on the wall."
Joshua,2,16,"She was like, 'Yo, head to the mountain ASAP so you don't run into those chasers. Chill there for three days until they bounce, then you can dip.'"
Joshua,2,17,"And the guys were like, 'Yo, we ain't gonna take no blame for that oath you made us swear.'"
Joshua,2,18,"Yo, when we finally enter the land, make sure you tie this sick red thread in the window where you let us down. Then, gather your fam - your dad, mom, siblings, and everyone in your dad's crib - all under one roof. Eazy peazy lemon squeezy."
Joshua,2,19,"Yo, listen up! If anyone leaves your crib and gets hurt out on the streets, it's on them - we ain't responsible! But if they chill with you at home and something happens, we'll take the blame, man, no problem!"
Joshua,2,20,"And if you spill the tea on our business, we won't hold you to that promise you made us."
Joshua,2,21,"She was like, 'Okay, if you say so.' Then she let them go and they left. And she tied a red string in the window."
Joshua,2,22,"So they went to the mountain and stayed there for three days, until the people chasing them went back. The pursuers searched everywhere, but couldn't find them."
Joshua,2,23,"So like, those two dudes came back from the mountain, and they went down and crossed over, and they found Joshua, you know, Nun's son, and they spilled all the tea about what went down."
Joshua,2,24,"And they were like, dude, Joshua, you won't believe it! The LORD totally handed over all the land to us. I mean, seriously, all the people living there are freaking out because of us. They're literally melting with fear, bro! {faint: in Hebrew, it means melt}"
Joshua,3,1,"So, Joshua woke up super early in the morning and they left Shittim and arrived at the Jordan River. It was him and all the Israelite crew chilling there, getting ready to cross over."
Joshua,3,2,"So, like, three days later, the officers like totally went through the whole crew;"
Joshua,3,3,"So they were like, 'Yo peeps, listen up. When you see the box thingy called the ark of the special agreement with the LORD your God, and the priests who are Levites carrying it, you gotta bounce from where you're at and follow that thing.'"
Joshua,3,4,"But keep a distance, about two thousand units away from it, and don't get too close, so that you know which way to go. This is new territory for you, so you haven't been here before. (It's like, totally recent, not long back.)"
Joshua,3,5,"Joshua was like, yo people! Get yourselves ready, cuz tomorrow the LORD is gonna do some epic stuff among you!"
Joshua,3,6,"So Joshua was like, 'Hey, priests, grab the ark of the covenant and lead the way for the peeps.' And the priests did just that, lifting up the ark and going ahead of the people."
Joshua,3,7,"And God was like, 'Yo, Joshua, today I'm gonna make you look super awesome in front of all Israel so they know I got your back just like I did with Moses.'"
Joshua,3,8,"And you gotta tell the priests who carry the ark, like, when you reach the edge of the water at Jordan, just, like, pause and chill in Jordan."
Joshua,3,9,"Yo, listen up, fam! Joshua straight up told the Israelite squad, 'Yo, gather round and tune in to the words of the LORD your God.'"
Joshua,3,10,"So, like, Joshua was all like, yo, this is how you'll know for sure that the living God is chillin' with you - He's gonna totally kick out all those Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites from your turf. No doubt about it, fam."
Joshua,3,11,"Yo fam, check it out! The ark of the Lord's covenant, the one that belongs to the big boss up in the heavens, is about to cross over into the Jordan River right in front of y'all."
Joshua,3,12,"Yo, listen up! I need twelve dudes, one from each tribe of Israel. Get on it!"
Joshua,3,13,"And so, when the feet of the priests carrying the sacred ark of the LORD, the Almighty God, touch the waters of the Jordan River, the Jordan River's flow will stop, separating the waters above from the ones below, and creating a pile of water for them to stand on."
Joshua,3,14,"So, like, when the people left their tents to cross over the Jordan River, and the priests were carrying the sacred ark in front of them;"
Joshua,3,15,"So, when those carrying the ark reached the Jordan River and the priests' feet, who were carrying the ark, touched the edge of the water (because the Jordan River was flooded during harvest season),"
Joshua,3,16,"So, like, the water came down from above and formed, like, this huge heap way far from the city Adam, you know, next to Zaretan. And then, the water that flowed towards the plain, you know, the salty sea, like, ran out and stopped flowing. So the people were able to walk across, like, right in front of Jericho."
Joshua,3,17,"So, like, the priests holding the ark of the LORD's covenant stood steady on dry land in the middle of the Jordan river, and all the Israelites crossed over on dry land, until everyone had safely made it across the whole Jordan river."
Joshua,4,1,"So, like, after everyone crossed over the Jordan River and stuff, the LORD, like, spoke to Joshua and was all like,"
Joshua,4,2,"Yo, gather up twelve dudes from the group, one guy from each tribe."
Joshua,4,3,"Yo, tell them to grab those twelve stones from where the priests were chillin' with their feet in the Jordan River. Make sure to bring 'em along with you and leave 'em in the spot where you'll crash for the night."
Joshua,4,4,"So Joshua gathered up the squad of twelve dudes, handpicked from the Israel crew, one guy from each tribe:"
Joshua,4,5,"So Joshua told them, yo, go ahead and cross over in front of the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan. And make sure each of you grabs a stone on your shoulder, representing the tribes of the children of Israel."
Joshua,4,6,"So, like, let this be a total sign for you guys. Like, when your future kids ask you someday, like, 'Yo, what's the deal with these stones?'"
Joshua,4,7,"So, like, when they ask you, tell them that the water at the Jordan River got split in half by the ark of the covenant of the LORD, you know? It was like a crazy moment when it passed through, the water just split! And these stones are there as a total reminder to the kids of Israel, forever and ever."
Joshua,4,8,"So the Israelite crew, hyped up by Joshua's orders, grabbed twelve big rocks from the middle of Jordan, just like the LORD told Joshua. They made sure to grab one for each of the tribes of Israel fam. Then they hauled those rocks with them to their chill spot and dropped them there."
Joshua,4,9,"So, Joshua placed twelve stones right in the middle of the Jordan River, exactly where the priests carrying the sacred ark stood. And guess what? Those stones are still there even now!"
Joshua,4,10,"So, like, the priests who were carrying the ark were standing in the middle of the Jordan River until everything was done that the LORD told Joshua to say to the people, just as Moses had commanded Joshua. And the people hurried up and crossed over."
Joshua,4,11,"When everyone had crossed over, the ark of the LORD also crossed over, along with the priests, in front of everyone."
Joshua,4,12,"So, like, the kids from Reuben, Gad, and half of Manasseh, they all crossed over, armed and ready, leading the way for the rest of the Israelite gang, just like Moses told them to do, ya know?"
Joshua,4,13,"Around 40k warriors flexed and marched before the LORD, ready to bring the fight to the plains of Jericho. They were armed to the teeth, no doubt!"
Joshua,4,14,"That day, the LORD made Joshua super popular among all the people of Israel. They were totally in awe of him, just like they were with Moses. It stayed that way for his entire life!"
Joshua,4,15,"Yo, the LORD straight up spoke to Joshua like,"
Joshua,4,16,Tell the priests carrying the holy ark to bounce out of Jordan.
Joshua,4,17,"So Joshua was like, yo priests, come outta Jordan."
Joshua,4,18,"So, once the priests who were carrying the sacred ark of the Lord stepped out of the middle of the Jordan River, their feet touched the dry ground, and suddenly the waters of the Jordan went back to where they came from and flooded over its banks, just like they were before. The priests totally rocked it!"
Joshua,4,19,"So, like, the people, they crossed the Jordan River on the tenth day of the first month, and set up camp in this place called Gilgal, on the eastern edge of Jericho."
Joshua,4,20,So Joshua put those twelve stones they took from the Jordan River in Gilgal.
Joshua,4,21,"And he was like, talking to the children of Israel, and he's all like, 'Yo, whenever your kids come up to you later and be like, 'What's up with these rocks?' or whatever, you gotta tell 'em what's what, ya know?'"
Joshua,4,22,"Yo, make sure you tell your homies, like, Israel crossed over this Jordan River without even gettin' wet, man."
Joshua,4,23,"Bruh, God totally made the waters of the Jordan River disappear so y'all could cross over safely. It was just like when He made the Red Sea dry so the Israelites could pass through. It was lit!"
Joshua,4,24,"So that everyone on earth can see how powerful the LORD is and be in awe of Him forever. Like, fear and respect the LORD your God for like, all days and stuff."
Joshua,5,1,"So, like, all the cool kings of the Amorites on the side of Jordan and the kings of the Canaanites by the sea heard that the LORD totally dried up the waters of the Jordan for the Israelites to cross over. And, bro, it freaked them out big time. Their hearts melted, and they lost all their courage because of the Israelite squad."
Joshua,5,2,"So like, the LORD was all, 'Yo Joshua, grab some super sharp knives and, like, do the whole circumcision thing again on all the Israelite kids, for the second time. Like, really sharp knives, maybe even flint ones.'"
Joshua,5,3,So Joshua got some really sharp knives and circumcised all the kids in Israel up on the hill where the foreskins were cut off. #KnivesOfFlint #GibeahHaaraloth
Joshua,5,4,"So, here's why Joshua decided to circumcise: all the guys who came from Egypt, including the brave warriors, didn't make it through the wilderness alive after leaving Egypt."
Joshua,5,5,"So, like, all the people who came out were circumcised, ya know? But the ones who were born in the wilderness, on the way out of Egypt, they didn't get circumcised and stuff."
Joshua,5,6,"So, the Israelite squad spent a solid 40 years wandering the wilderness because they straight-up didn't follow the Lord's orders. It was a punishment for all the war-ready folks who dipped from Egypt but couldn't listen to the Lord's voice. Turns out the Lord swore that He wouldn't bless them with the promised land, you know, the one flowing with milk and honey that He swore to their ancestors."
Joshua,5,7,"And Joshua gave their children, the ones he took the place of, the snip-snip treatment because they hadn't been snipped during the journey."
Joshua,5,8,"And, like, after they finished circumcising everyone, they just stayed in their spots at the camp until they were healed up and stuff. You know, like, done with their circumcision and all."
Joshua,5,9,"And God was like, Joshuaa, bro, today I totally wiped out all the hate from your past life in Egypt. That's why we're chilling in this place called Gilgal, like, forever now. It's all about moving on, you know? #NoMoreHate #GilgalMeansRolling"
Joshua,5,10,"So the Israel squad set up camp in Gilgal and celebrated the passover on the fourteenth day of the month, right when the sun was setting, in the plains of Jericho."
Joshua,5,11,"And they totally grubbed on some vintage snacks the day after the passover - we're talking unleavened cakes and straight-up toasted grain. It was lit, all happening on the same day."
Joshua,5,12,"And the heavenly grub stopped showing up the next day after they finished all the leftover munchies from back in the day; the Israelite squad didn't have any more heavenly grub then, but they got to indulge in the tasty treats of the Canaan land that year."
Joshua,5,13,"So, Joshua was near Jericho and he happened to look up and saw a dude standing in front of him, holding a sword. Joshua went up to him and asked, 'Are you on our side or the enemies' side?'"
Joshua,5,14,"And he was like, nah bro, but I'm here as the top dog of the whole squad of the LORD. And Joshua straight up dropped to the ground, showing respect and was like, yo, what's up king, what message you got for your boy?"
Joshua,5,15,"The boss of the LORD's squad was like, 'Yo Joshua, take off your kicks, 'cause where you're standin' is super holy.' And Joshua was like, 'Bet, boss' and did exactly that."
Joshua,6,1,"So basically, Jericho was totally locked down because of those Israelite peeps. Nobody could leave, nobody could come in. Can't even flex, it was completely on lockdown, you feel me?"
Joshua,6,2,"Yo, Josh, listen up. God just told me to tell you that He's totally handing over Jericho to you. Check it out - you're getting the whole package, the city and its boss, plus all those super tough guys."
Joshua,6,3,"And you guys, like, surround the city and all you warriors, like, go around the city one time. That's what you should do for six days."
Joshua,6,4,"And there will be seven lit priests holding up seven rad trumpets made from rams' horns. On the seventh day, y'all gotta surround the city seven times, while the priests rock the trumpets like pros."
Joshua,6,5,"And it's gonna happen, like, when they make a super loud noise with the ram's horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people gotta shout super loud. Then the city walls are gonna totally crumble, and everyone can just go straight ahead and enter."
Joshua,6,6,"So Joshua, son of Nun, shouted for the priests and told them, 'Yo, pick up the ark of the covenant and have seven priests carry seven dope rams' horn trumpets in front of it.'"
Joshua,6,7,"And he was like, yo, people! Go ahead and circle the city, and make sure those with weapons go in front of the ark of the LORD."
Joshua,6,8,"So basically, Joshua was talking to the peeps and then these seven priests came through holding these lit trumpets made out of rams' horns and started playing them real loud. And guess what? The ark of the covenant of the LORD was right behind them, following their lead."
Joshua,6,9,"So the soldiers went ahead of the priests who were blowing the trumpets, and the group bringing up the rear followed the ark. The priests kept marching and blowing the trumpets."
Joshua,6,10,So Joshua told everyone not to shout or make any noise until he says so. You gotta keep quiet and not say anything until he gives the signal. Then you can shout it out!
Joshua,6,11,"So the epic ark of the LORD totally encircled the city, doing a sick lap around it: and they rolled into the camp, and crashed at the campsite."
Joshua,6,12,"So Joshua woke up super early in the morning, and the priests grabbed the ark of the LORD."
Joshua,6,13,"So there were like seven priests holding these sick trumpets made from ram horns, and they were straight up rocking it in front of the ark of the LORD. They kept going at it, blowing those trumpets all day long. And get this, the armed dudes were leading the way, while the rest of the squad was bringing up the rear, all while the priests were still jamming on their trumpets."
Joshua,6,14,"On the second day, they circled around the city once and went back to their camp. They did the same thing for six days."
Joshua,6,15,"So, like, on the seventh day, they woke up super early, right as the sun was rising, and went around the city in the same way seven times. And, yeah, only on that day they went around the city seven times."
Joshua,6,16,"So, like, after the priests had blown the trumpets seven times, Joshua was all like, 'Yo, shout it out, guys! The LORD totally hooked you up with this city.'"
Joshua,6,17,"Like, the city is gonna be super cursed, you know? And everything in it is, like, totally cursed to the Lord. But, hold up, Rahab the harlot is gonna live, alright? Like, her and everyone with her in the house, they're safe. 'Cause she hid the messengers we sent. Yeah, super blessed for that!"
Joshua,6,18,"Yo, make sure you stay far away from anything that's all cursed and stuff, or else you're gonna get cursed too, you feel me? Don't go grabbin' any cursed things and messin' up the whole Israel camp. It'll just bring a whole lotta trouble, trust me."
Joshua,6,19,"But like, all the shiny silver, gold, and stuff made of brass and iron is dedicated to God, you know? It goes into the Lord's treasure chest. Like, it's all holy and sacred, bro."
Joshua,6,20,"So, like, the crowd totally went wild when the priests blew the trumpets. And when the people heard that trumpet sound, they all let out this huge shout. And you won't believe it, but the wall like completely collapsed and crumbled. So, everyone just rushed into the city, no holding back, and they totally took over the place."
Joshua,6,21,"And they totally wrecked everything in the city, like every single person - young and old, and even the animals, like cows and sheep and donkeys - they did it all with their epic sword skills."
Joshua,6,22,"So Joshua told the two guys who were scoping out the area, 'Yo, head over to the harlot's crib and bring back the woman and everything she's got, just like you promised her.'"
Joshua,6,23,"The cool dudes who were undercover went in and rescued Rahab, her dad, her mom, her siblings, and everything she owned. They brought out all her extended fam and left them outside the Israel squad's camp. {kindred: in Hebrew, families}"
Joshua,6,24,"And they straight up set the whole city on fire, destroying everything inside it. However, they kept the silver, gold, brass, and iron in the Lord's crib. No loot went to waste!"
Joshua,6,25,"So, like, Joshua totally saved Rahab, the, um, let's say, not-so-good lady, and her whole fam and everything she owned. And get this, she still lives in Israel to this day, all because she hid the secret agents that Joshua sent to check out Jericho, you know?"
Joshua,6,26,"And Joshua was like, super serious with them, and he was all like, 'Dude, I'm telling you now, anyone who dares to build this city called Jericho, they're totally gonna be cursed by the LORD. It's gnarly, man. Like, seriously cursed. They'll end up sacrificing their firstborn to lay the foundation, and their youngest kid will be the one setting up the gates. It's not gonna be good, bro."
Joshua,6,27,"So, like, God was totally vibing with Joshua, and everyone out there heard about how epic he was in the whole land."
Joshua,7,1,"But the Israelites messed up big time with the forbidden stuff. This guy Achan, from the tribe of Judah, took some of that forbidden stuff, and it made God super angry at all the Israelites. (Achan was also known as Achar, and Zabdi was also called Zimri.)"
Joshua,7,2,"So Joshua sent some guys from Jericho to check out Ai, which is near Bethaven, on the east side of Bethel. He told them, 'Go on up and scope out the land.' And those dudes went up and did their inspection of Ai."
Joshua,7,3,"So they went back to Joshua and told him, 'Hey, don't send all the squad up there, just let like two or three thousand of us go take down Ai. We don't want everyone to go through all the trouble, after all, they're not that many. Ya know, just a heads up.'"
Joshua,7,4,"So, like, around three thousand guys went up there, but they totally panicked and ran away from the dudes in Ai."
Joshua,7,5,The dudes from Ai totally wrecked about 36 guys because they chased them all the way from the gate to Shebarim and took them out while they were trying to flee. This caused the people's hearts to melt like water. (Or in Morad)
Joshua,7,6,"Joshua was totally shook and completely wrecked. He straight up ripped his clothes and prostrated himself on the ground in front of the ark of the LORD, all the way until evening. And not only him, but also the elders of Israel were there, too, showing their grief by putting dust on their heads."
Joshua,7,7,"Joshua was like, OMG, Lord GOD, why did you even bring us across the Jordan River just to let the Amorites take over and destroy us? Ugh, I wish we could've just stayed on the other side of the river!"
Joshua,7,8,"Yo, how am I supposed to react when Israel straight up bails on their enemies? Like, seriously!"
Joshua,7,9,"Like, if the Canaanites and everyone around here find out about this, they're totally gonna come at us from all sides and erase our name from existence. So, what's your move, considering your big reputation?"
Joshua,7,10,"So God was like, Joshuaa, come on now, why you laying around on your face like that? Get up!' (FYI, 'liest' means 'fallest' in Hebrew)"
Joshua,7,11,"Israel messed up big time. They totally broke the deal I made with them, like, epic fail. They straight up took stuff that was cursed, stole things, lied about it, and shoved it in with their own belongings. Not cool, man."
Joshua,7,12,"So, like, the Israelites totally couldn't handle their enemies, and they straight up ran away from them. It's all because they were in, like, major trouble, you know? And let me tell you, I won't be on your side anymore unless you get rid of the troublemakers from your crew."
Joshua,7,13,"Yo, listen up! It's time to get real and clean yourselves up for tomorrow. The big man upstairs, the LORD God of Israel, has dropped some knowledge on y'all. There's some seriously bad juju going on in your midst, O Israel. You won't be able to handle your enemies until you get rid of this cursed thing among you. So, do what you gotta do and cleanse yourselves ASAP."
Joshua,7,14,"So, like, in the morning, you guys will be sorted by your tribes, ya know? And here's the deal: the tribe that the LORD chooses will show up with their fams, and the fam that the LORD picks will come with their whole squad, and each person chosen by the LORD will show up one by one, my dudes."
Joshua,7,15,"So, like, anyone who's caught with the cursed thing, they gotta get burned along with all their stuff. It's 'cause they totally broke God's covenant and did some messed up stuff in Israel."
Joshua,7,16,"So Joshua woke up super early in the morning, and gathered all the peeps from Israel according to their squads; and guess what, the squad of Judah got chosen:"
Joshua,7,17,"And he gathered the crew of Judah, and he selected the squad of the Zarhites. He brought each member of the Zarhites fam one by one, and Zabdi was chosen:"
Joshua,7,18,"So he made everybody in his household line up in a row, and this dude named Achan, who was the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, from the Judah fam, got singled out."
Joshua,7,19,"Joshua was like, 'Yo Achan, my dude, just be real with God, man. Confess your sins and spill the tea. Don't hold back, tell me everything you did."
Joshua,7,20,"So Joshua asked Achan what went down, and Achan was like, 'No doubt, I messed up big time and went against the Almighty God of Israel. Here's exactly what I did.'"
Joshua,7,21,"So, like, there I was checking out all the cool stuff we got from the battle, right? And I come across this sick Babylonish outfit, some silver worth two hundred shekels, and this golden wedge weighing fifty shekels! And, man, I couldn't resist the temptation, so I just took them for myself. Now they're all stashed away in the ground in the middle of my tent, with the silver hiding underneath. (By the way, 'wedge' means tonguee' in Hebrew, just so you know.)"
Joshua,7,22,"So Joshua texted his crew and they sprinted to the tent; and yo, they found it stashed in his crib, with the cash hidden underneath."
Joshua,7,23,"So they took them out of the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the Israelite squad, and showed them off in front of the LORD."
Joshua,7,24,"So, Joshua, along with all of Israel, captured this dude named Achan, who was the son of Zerah. And get this, they found some silver, a sick outfit, a gold wedge, his kids, his animals (including oxen, donkeys, and sheep), his tent, and basically everything he owned! They brought all of it to this place called the valley of Achor."
Joshua,7,25,"Joshua was like, bro, why you gotta be messing with us? God's gonna mess with you big time today. And then all of Israel straight up stoned him with rocks and burned everything after the stoning. No joke."
Joshua,7,26,"And they piled up a huge bunch of rocks over him that's still there today. So God chilled out and stopped being so mad. That's why they named that place 'The valley of Achor,' which means 'Trouble.'"
Joshua,8,1,"Then God was like, 'Yo Joshua, chillax and don't stress. Gather your squad and get ready to roll out to Ai. I got you, I'm giving you Ai's king, people, city, and land on a silver platter.'"
Joshua,8,2,"Yo, go ahead and handle Ai and its king just like you did with Jericho and its king, except this time, you can keep all the spoils and livestock for yourselves. But wait, here's the plan: set up an ambush behind the city, okay?"
Joshua,8,3,"So Joshua got up, and together with all the warriors, they went to attack Ai. Joshua handpicked 30,000 total badasses and sent them off under the cover of darkness."
Joshua,8,4,"So he tells them, like, listen up, you guys gotta chill near the city and wait, but not too far away, just be ready and stuff:"
Joshua,8,5,"Me and all my squad gonna roll up to the city. And when they try to come at us like they did before, we gonna dip out real quick."
Joshua,8,6,"Yo, we gotta lead them away from the city before they catch up to us, 'cause if they see us running scared, they gonna come at us even harder. So let's dip out first and get 'em to follow our lead, just like we did before. Gotta be sneaky, like yanking 'em away from the city, you know?"
Joshua,8,7,"Yo, once you finish hiding and chilling in the cut, it's time to make moves and take over the city, because the LORD your God is about to hand it to you on a platter."
Joshua,8,8,"And, like, when you take over the city, you gotta light that place up, just like the LORD told ya. Trust me, I gave you the command."
Joshua,8,9,"So Joshua sent them out to hide and they went to chill between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai. But Joshua crashed with the squad that night."
Joshua,8,10,"So, like, Joshua woke up super early in the morning and started counting all the people. He and the elders of Israel, you know, went ahead of everyone to Ai."
Joshua,8,11,"And all the peeps, even the warriors rollin' with him, went up, got closer, and approached the city. They set up camp on the north side of Ai. Yo, there was a valley between 'em and Ai tho."
Joshua,8,12,"So he gathered around 5K dudes and put them in stealth mode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city. #sneaky"
Joshua,8,13,"And after they had placed all the people, including their sneaky group on the west side of the city and their hidden attackers on the north side of the city, Joshua secretly entered the valley in the middle of the night."
Joshua,8,14,"So, like, the king of Ai, right? He saw what was up and he and his peeps got all hyped and woke up mad early. They all came out of the city to fight against Israel, at a set time and in the open field. But little did he know, there were sneaky liers hiding in wait behind the city!"
Joshua,8,15,"So Joshua and all of Israel acted like they got totally wrecked, and dipped out through the wilderness."
Joshua,8,16,"So, like, everyone in Ai, they all got together to chase after them, you know? And they were all like, 'Let's go get Joshua!' and they totally left the city."
Joshua,8,17,"And like, dude, there wasn't even a single person left in Ai or Bethel who didn't go after Israel, ya know? They just straight up abandoned the city and started chasing after Israel."
Joshua,8,18,"Yo, God was like, Joshuaa, take that spear you got and point it towards Ai. I'm gonna make sure you win this battle.' So Joshua did just that, he stretched out his arm and aimed the spear at the city."
Joshua,8,19,"Then the surprise attack squad sprung forth from their hiding spot, bolting as soon as their leader made a hand signal. With stealth and speed, they infiltrated the city, capturing it swiftly and without delay, then setting it ablaze in haste."
Joshua,8,20,"So, like, the guys from Ai turned around and saw smoke billowing up from the city, reaching up to the sky and stuff. They were totally trapped, with no way to escape. And the people who had tried to run away and hide in the wilderness ended up running right into their pursuers. It was intense, dude."
Joshua,8,21,"So, like, Joshua and all of Israel peeped that the whole ambush thing worked and the city got taken down, and there was smoke everywhere. And then they're like, 'Alright, time to finish the job' and they took out all the dudes in Ai."
Joshua,8,22,"Then the other group came out of the city to confront them, and they were surrounded by the people of Israel, with some on one side and others on the opposite side. They attacked them and defeated them completely, leaving no survivors or escapees."
Joshua,8,23,So they managed to capture the king of Ai and brought him back to Joshua.
Joshua,8,24,"So, like, after Israel finished totally wiping out all the people of Ai in the field, while they were running away in the wilderness, and they all got defeated by the sword, until none of them were left, all the Israelites went back to Ai and totally attacked it with their swords, dude."
Joshua,8,25,"So, like, that day was pretty intense. There were a total of 12k casualties from both guys and girls, all from the city of Ai, you know?"
Joshua,8,26,Joshua didn't hesitate to attack Ai until he had wiped out every last person there with his spear.
Joshua,8,27,"So, like, the Israel peeps totally just snagged the cows and stuff in that city as a prize for themselves, just doing what the LORD told Joshua to do."
Joshua,8,28,"So Joshua totally destroyed Ai and left it in ruins, never to be rebuilt even up to this day."
Joshua,8,29,"So, they hung the king of Ai on a tree until evening. Then, when the sun went down, Joshua ordered them to take his body down from the tree and throw it at the entrance of the city gate. They piled up a big heap of stones on top of it, and it's still there even today."
Joshua,8,30,"So Joshua flexed and constructed a mad altar for the LORD God of Israel on top of mount Ebal,"
Joshua,8,31,"Just like Moses, who served the LORD, told the kids of Israel to do in the book of the law of Moses, they made an altar out of whole stones and didn't use any iron tools. They offered burnt offerings and peace offerings to the LORD on that altar."
Joshua,8,32,"And he wrote down the law of Moses on some stones, right in front of all the Israelite homies."
Joshua,8,33,"So, like, all of Israel, including their elders, officers, and judges, gathered on one side of the ark, while the priests, who were Levites, carried the ark of the LORD's covenant, you know? And it didn't matter if you were a stranger or born in Israel, they all stood there. Half of them were facing mount Gerizim, and the other half were facing mount Ebal, just like Moses, the LORD's servant, had commanded. The whole point was to bless the people of Israel, man."
Joshua,8,34,"Then he like totally read all the words of the law, you know, the blessings and cursings, like everything that was written in the book of the law."
Joshua,8,35,"Joshua made sure to read every single thing that Moses had commanded to the whole congregation of Israel, including the women, the kids, and the people who were visiting. He didn't miss a single word!"
Joshua,9,1,"So like, this happened when all the kings on the other side of the Jordan River, up in the hills, down in the valleys, and along the coastline of the big sea across from Lebanon (you know, the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites), heard about it."
Joshua,9,2,"So they all joined forces to go up against Joshua and the Israelites, united as one. {Heb. mouth}"
Joshua,9,3,"So like, when the people in Gibeon found out about the sick moves Joshua pulled on Jericho and Ai,"
Joshua,9,4,They were lowkey scheming and decided to act all official by pretending to be ambassadors. They threw some worn-out sacks on their donkeys and carried old and torn wine bottles.
Joshua,9,5,"They were wearing worn-out shoes and patched clothes, and all their food was stale and covered in mold."
Joshua,9,6,"So they went up to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the people of Israel, 'Hey, we've come all the way from a distant land. So, like, let's make a chill agreement, okay?'"
Joshua,9,7,"So, like, the dudes from Israel were all like, 'Yo, maybe you Hivites live around here, right? How are we supposed to make this alliance thingy with you?'"
Joshua,9,8,"And they were like, yo Joshua, we're here to serve you. And Joshua was like, who even are you guys? Where y'all come from?"
Joshua,9,9,"And they were like, 'Dude, we come from, like, a hella distant place 'cause we heard about the epicness of the LORD your God. We've been hearing all about the sick stuff He pulled off in Egypt, ya know?"
Joshua,9,10,"And all the stuff he did to those two Amorite kings, you know, the ones across the Jordan River - Sihon, the king of Heshbon, and Og, the king of Bashan, who ruled from Ashtaroth."
Joshua,9,11,"So, like, the older peeps and everyone in our hood were all like, 'Yo, grab some grub for the trip and go meet them, and tell 'em we're down to be your peeps and make a pact, ya know?'"
Joshua,9,12,"Yo, this bread we grabbed fresh from our cribs when we dipped out to see you ain't lookin' so lit anymore – it's all crusty and moldy now, smh 😬"
Joshua,9,13,"So like, these flasks of wine we filled up were totally new, right? But check it out, they got all torn and messed up. And now our clothes and shoes are just hella worn out from this insanely long trip we've been on. It's been rough, man."
Joshua,9,14,"And the guys grabbed their grub, without bothering to seek advice from the Big Guy upstairs. (Or, as they say, 'they didn't consult the Lord's hotline')."
Joshua,9,15,"So Joshua was like, 'Yo, let's be cool with each other' and they were all like, 'Yeah, good idea, bro.' They made a pact to coexist, and the leaders of the community promised to honor it."
Joshua,9,16,"So after about three days of forming an alliance with them, they found out that those peeps were actually their next-door homies living in the same hood."
Joshua,9,17,"So, the Israelite squad hit the road and rolled up to their cities on the third day. These cities were called Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim."
Joshua,9,18,"The Israelites didn't attack them because their leaders made a promise to them in the name of the LORD, the God of Israel. But the whole group started complaining about their leaders."
Joshua,9,19,"But like, all the high-ups were like, yo to the entire crew, we made a serious promise to them in the name of the LORD God of Israel and so we can't lay a finger on them, man."
Joshua,9,20,"So here's the deal, we won't touch them. We'll let them live, you know, to avoid getting ourselves into some serious bad vibes and all, because we made this promise to them and we gotta keep our word."
Joshua,9,21,"The leaders were like, 'Okay, fine. Let them live, but they gotta be the ones doing all the hard labor for everyone else.' Just like they said they would."
Joshua,9,22,"So Joshua was like, 'Yo, come here.' And he talked to them, and he was like, 'Why'd you play us like that, saying you were mad far away from us when you're actually living right here?'"
Joshua,9,23,"So, like, you guys messed up big time and now you're totally cursed. There's, like, no escaping it - you're gonna be stuck as servants, doing all the hard labor like chopping wood and fetching water for the house of my God. Seriously, there's no way out of this punishment. Can't catch a break, I guess. #toughluck"
Joshua,9,24,"So, like, we totally heard, Joshua, that your crew got the memo from the big man upstairs, ya know, the LORD your God. He straight up commanded his boy Moses to hook you all up with the land, and to completely wipe out everyone who was chillin' there before you. And, like, we were seriously scared for our lives 'cause of you, so we ended up doing what we did, you feel me?"
Joshua,9,25,"And like, we're totally at your mercy, dude. So, whatever you think is cool and fair to do to us, go ahead and do it."
Joshua,9,26,"And he did the same to them, and saved them from the children of Israel, so they didn't kill them."
Joshua,9,27,"So, Joshua assigned them the job of chopping wood and carrying water for the people and the LORD's altar. This tradition has continued to this day in the chosen location."
Joshua,10,1,"So, like, Adonizedek, the king of Jerusalem, heard, ya know, news about Joshua totally wrecking Ai, just like he did with Jericho. And, get this, the people of Gibeon made peace with Israel and joined 'em. Like, big moves, man"
Joshua,10,2,"They were totally shook because Gibeon was a legit massive city, like one of those fancy royal cities, and it was even bigger than Ai, plus all the dudes there were super strong. #impressive"
Joshua,10,3,"So Adonizedek, the ruler of Jerusalem, reached out to Hoham, the boss of Hebron, and Piram, the top dog of Jarmuth, and Japhia, the kingpin of Lachish, and Debir, the head honcho of Eglon, with a message,"
Joshua,10,4,"Yo, come join me and let's wreck Gibeon together. They made peace with Joshua and the Israelite crew."
Joshua,10,5,"So, like, the five rulers of the Amorites - the ruler of Jerusalem, the ruler of Hebron, the ruler of Jarmuth, the ruler of Lachish, the ruler of Eglon - got together and, like, gathered their armies. They camped before Gibeon and were all ready to go to war against them."
Joshua,10,6,"So, like, the dudes from Gibeon hit up Joshua at the camp in Gilgal, and they were all like, 'Yo, don't chillax, bro! Come through and help us out ASAP! We're getting wrecked here by all the kings of the Amorites up in the mountains, they all ganged up on us!'"
Joshua,10,7,"So Joshua and his squad rolled out from Gilgal, along with all the warriors and the legendary badasses."
Joshua,10,8,"And God was like, Joshuaa, don't even trip! I'm totally handing them over to you. Not a single one of them will be able to stand against you.'"
Joshua,10,9,So Joshua shows up out of nowhere and heads out from Gilgal in the middle of the night.
Joshua,10,10,"Yo, God totally wrecked those dudes in front of Israel, straight up killed 'em in a major showdown at Gibeon, then chased 'em along the road that goes up to Bethhoron, and totally smoked 'em all the way to Azekah and Makkedah."
Joshua,10,11,"So, here's what happened: as the enemies tried to escape from Israel and were near Bethhoron, the LORD dropped some massive stones from the sky on them, right to Azekah, and they bit the dust. And get this - more of them were taken down by those hailstones than by the swords of the children of Israel."
Joshua,10,12,"So Joshua was talking to God that day when God handed over the Amorites to the Israelites, and he said in front of everyone, 'Yo, Sun, stay put over Gibeon, and Moon, chill in the valley of Ajalon.' (*whispering*: or be silent, you know)."
Joshua,10,13,"And yo, check this out, the sun was straight up chillin', didn't move an inch, and the moon was like 'hold up, I got you too', all because the peeps needed to get revenge on their enemies. Ain't this written in that book called Jasher? So yeah, the sun stayed right where it was in the sky, didn't even rush to go down for a whole day. (Jasher might mean 'the upright' or something, just sayin')"
Joshua,10,14,"OMG, like no other day in HISTORY, before or after, the LORD actually LISTENED to a human's voice! It was lit AF because the LORD was totally fighting for Israel! 🙌"
Joshua,10,15,So Joshua and all of Israel went back to the camp at Gilgal.
Joshua,10,16,So these five kings yeeted out and went into hiding in a sick cave at Makkedah.
Joshua,10,17,"So, like, word got to Joshua saying that, dude, the five kings are all, like, hiding out in this cave at Makkedah."
Joshua,10,18,"Joshua was like, yo, let's put some big-ass rocks in front of the cave and station dudes there to guard it, no joke."
Joshua,10,19,"Don't hold back, go after your enemies and take down the stragglers. Don't let them retreat to their cities, because the LORD your God has given them into your control. They're done for!"
Joshua,10,20,"So, like, after Joshua and the cool kids of Israel finished totally wrecking their enemies with a mega brutal attack until they were completely wiped out, the few survivors who were left decided to seek shelter in fortified cities, you know?"
Joshua,10,21,"Then everyone went back to Joshua at the camp in Makkedah, no one said anything negative about the children of Israel."
Joshua,10,22,"So Joshua was like, yo, open up that cave and bring me those five kings from inside the cave."
Joshua,10,23,"And they did that, and brought those five kings to him from the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon."
Joshua,10,24,"So, when they brought out those kings to Joshua, he called for all the guys in Israel and told the war captains who were with him, 'Hey, come up close and put your feet on the necks of these kings.' And they went up close and put their feet on their necks."
Joshua,10,25,"Yo, Joshua was like, calm down fam, don't be afraid or stressed out or anything. Stay strong and brave, 'cause the Lord's got your back. He's gonna handle all those enemies y'all are up against."
Joshua,10,26,"And then Joshua totally wrecked them, straight up killed them, and hung them on five trees: and they were just hanging there until the sun went down."
Joshua,10,27,"So Joshua was like, 'Yo, it's sunset time,' and he told his crew to take those dudes off the trees and throw them into the cave where they were hiding. Then they put huge rocks to seal off the cave, and those rocks are still there to this day."
Joshua,10,28,"So, Joshua totally conquered Makkedah that day and gave it a good whack with his sword. He completely wiped out their king, along with everyone else in the city. He left no survivors, just like he did to the king of Jericho."
Joshua,10,29,"So Joshua and all of Israel kept moving after conquering Makkedah, and went to Libnah, where they battled against the people there:"
Joshua,10,30,"And God totally handed it over to Israel, along with the king, and they totally defeated it with their swords, and everyone there got defeated too, they left no one alive, and they totally did to the king what they did to the king of Jericho."
Joshua,10,31,"So Joshua took his crew and bounced from Libnah to Lachish. They set up camp, ready to throw down and battle against it:"
Joshua,10,32,"And God handed over Lachish to Israel, who took it on the second day, and attacked it with swords, and all the people inside, just like what happened in Libnah."
Joshua,10,33,"So, Horam, the king of Gezer, decided to give Lachish a hand and join the fight. But Joshua totally owned him and his crew, wiping them out completely."
Joshua,10,34,"So Joshua went from Lachish to Eglon, with all of Israel by his side. They set up camp and went to war against it:"
Joshua,10,35,"And they totally wrecked it that day, slashing it with their epic swords, and completely wiped out all the people inside, just like they did to Lachish."
Joshua,10,36,"So Joshua and all the cool Israel peeps rolled up to Hebron, ready to throw down and go to war against it:"
Joshua,10,37,"And they just straight up attacked it with swords, yo. They didn't spare nobody - they took out the king, all the cities, and every single person there. They left no survivors, like for real. It was like what happened to Eglon - complete destruction, man. Nobody was left standing."
Joshua,10,38,So Joshua and all of Israel went back to Debir and battled against it.
Joshua,10,39,"Then he completely took over the whole place, including the king and all the cities. They defeated them using their swords and wiped out every single person there. Not a single soul was left behind. He did the same thing to Debir and its king, just like he did to Hebron. And he also did it to Libnah and its king."
Joshua,10,40,"So Joshua straight up wrecked all the hilly, southern, valley, and spring regions, along with their kings. He didn't leave a single soul alive, just completely wiped out everyone, just like the LORD God of Israel ordered."
Joshua,10,41,"Joshua totally wrecked those dudes from Kadeshbarnea all the way to Gaza, and he even dominated the entire region of Goshen up to Gibeon."
Joshua,10,42,"Joshua totally dominated all these kings and their territories in one shot, thanks to the epic power of the LORD God of Israel who fought alongside Israel."
Joshua,10,43,"So Joshua and all of Israel went back to the camp at Gilgal, yo!"
Joshua,11,1,"So, like, Jabin, the king of Hazor, heard about all that stuff happening, ya know? And he was like, 'Yo, let's hit up Jobab, the king of Madon, and also the kings of Shimron and Achshaph.'"
Joshua,11,2,"And to the kings that were up north in the mountains, and down south in the plains near Chinneroth, and in the valley, and along the borders of Dor on the west,"
Joshua,11,3,"And there were, like, Canaanites everywhere, to the east and to the west, and also Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, and Jebusites up in the mountains, and even Hivites chillin' under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh."
Joshua,11,4,"So they all came out, with their entire squads, a huge crowd that stretched out as far as you could see, like a massive wave crashing on the beach. And they rolled in with loads of horses and countless chariots."
Joshua,11,5,"So like, when all these kings were like, gathered up and stuff, they all showed up and set up camp together at the waters of Merom, to like, fight against Israel. #epicbattle"
Joshua,11,6,"And God was like, yo Joshua, don't even stress about those guys, 'cause tomorrow around this time, I'm gonna give you their dead bodies to conquer. You gotta mess up their horses and straight up burn their chariots with fire, no mercy!"
Joshua,11,7,"So Joshua and his whole squad of warriors rolled up on these guys by the waters of Merom out of nowhere, and they straight up launched an attack on them."
Joshua,11,8,"So the LORD gave Israel a major win and they totally crushed their enemies, chasing them all the way to the cities of Zidon, Misrephothmaim, and the valley of Mizpeh. They kept winning battles until there was no one left standing. 🙌🏼 {Zidonrabbah: a.k.a. Big Zidon} {Misrephothmaim: also known as the Salt Pits: in Hebrew, it means Burnings of waters}"
Joshua,11,9,So Joshua did what the LORD told him to do: he disabled their horses and set their chariots on fire.
Joshua,11,10,"So, like, Joshua totally took charge and went back to Hazor. He straight up defeated the king there with his sword, you know? 'Cause Hazor used to be the top dog, ruling over all those other kingdoms."
Joshua,11,11,"And they straight up destroyed everyone there with their swords, like, no survivors whatsoever. Then they burned Hazor to the ground. Seriously, not a single person left standing. Crazy, right?"
Joshua,11,12,"Joshua straight up took down and wiped out all the cities and kings, just like Moses, the LORD's servant, told him to. He was total boss mode with that sword!"
Joshua,11,13,"So, like, all the cities that were super strong, Israel didn't burn any of them except for Hazor — that one, Joshua totally burned down, you know?"
Joshua,11,14,"So the Israelites claimed all the loot from these cities and took their livestock as well. They fought and defeated every single person, using their swords until they completely wiped them out. They didn't spare anyone, not even a single soul."
Joshua,11,15,"Moses totally passed on everything the LORD told him to Joshua, and Joshua did the same, not missing a single thing that the LORD told Moses. (BTW, 'left...: Heb. removed nothing)"
Joshua,11,16,"So Joshua claimed all that land, with the hills, the south country, Goshen, the valley, the plain, the mountain of Israel, and the valley too;"
Joshua,11,17,"He totally conquered all the cool kings from the mount Halak to Seir, all the way to Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon beneath mount Hermon. He straight up took them down, smacked them, and brought them to an end."
Joshua,11,18,"Joshua fought against those kings for, like, forever."
Joshua,11,19,"There wasn't a single city that decided to chill with the Israelite crew, except for the Hivites living in Gibeon. Those dudes managed to avoid a fight, while all the other cities got straight up conquered."
Joshua,11,20,"The LORD made their hearts stubborn so they would go against Israel in battle and end up totally wiped out. He wanted them to have no chance, just like the LORD told Moses to do."
Joshua,11,21,"So Joshua showed up and totally wiped out the Anakims from the mountains like Hebron, Debir, Anab, and all the mountains in Judah and Israel. He straight up destroyed them, cities and all."
Joshua,11,22,"Like, all the Anakims were totally gone from the land of the Israelite peeps, except for in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod. They were the only ones left, fam."
Joshua,11,23,"So Joshua totally conquered the entire land, just like the LORD instructed Moses. Then Joshua divided it up among the tribes of Israel as their inheritance. And finally, the land chilled out and enjoyed some peace after all the fighting."
Joshua,12,1,"So, like, these were the kings of the land that the Israelites totally defeated and took over their territory on the other side of the Jordan River, towards where the sun rises. They conquered everything from the Arnon River to Mount Hermon, and all the land in the east."
Joshua,12,2,"Yo, check it out, Sihon, the king of the Amorites, chilled in Heshbon. He was straight-up ruling from Aroer, right by the river Arnon, and from the middle of the river, all the way to half of Gilead, and even up to the river Jabbok, which was the border of the Ammonites."
Joshua,12,3,"And from the flat areas all the way to the Chinneroth ocean in the east, and to the plain ocean, yup, the salty sea in the east, leading to Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, below Ashdothpisgah: you know, Teman; or, Ashdothpisgah, the cool springs of Pisgah, or the hill, you know?"
Joshua,12,4,"And the territory controlled by Og, the king of Bashan who was one of the last surviving giants, and he ruled over Ashtaroth and Edrei."
Joshua,12,5,"And totally ruled over Mount Hermon, Salcah, and all of Bashan, all the way to where the Geshurites and Maachathites lived, and even half of Gilead, which was the territory of King Sihon of Heshbon."
Joshua,12,6,"So Moses, who was like a servant of the LORD, defeated them together with the children of Israel. After their victory, Moses, the LORD's servant, gave the land as a possession to the Reubenites, Gadites, and half of the Manasseh tribe."
Joshua,12,7,"And these are the total bosses that Joshua and the Israelite squad straight up owned on the west side of the Jordan River, from Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon all the way up to Mount Halak that leads to Seir. Joshua totally hooked up the tribes of Israel with this land as their own, each tribe getting their piece, no doubt."
Joshua,12,8,"In the mountains, valleys, plains, springs, wilderness, and southern region, there were the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites."
Joshua,12,9,"Got one king in Jericho and one king by Bethel, known as Ai."
Joshua,12,10,"The boss of Jerusalem, only one; the boss of Hebron, only one;"
Joshua,12,11,"Yas, the king of Jarmuth was one, and the king of Lachish was also one;"
Joshua,12,12,"Eglon had one king and Gezer had one king, yo!"
Joshua,12,13,We got one king from Debir and one king from Geder.
Joshua,12,14,"Hormah had one king, and Arad had one king too;"
Joshua,12,15,"We got the king of Libnah, like, y'know, one dude; and then we got the king of Adullam, also one dude;"
Joshua,12,16,"Makkedah's boss, one; Bethel's ruler, one;"
Joshua,12,17,"The king of Tappuah, legit one; the king of Hepher, also just one;"
Joshua,12,18,"The ruler of Aphek, just one; the ruler of Lasharon, also just one; {Lasharon: or, Sharon}"
Joshua,12,19,"One king in Madon, and one king in Hazor;"
Joshua,12,20,"The ruler of Shimronmeron, uno; the ruler of Achshaph, uno;"
Joshua,12,21,There was this dude ruling over Taanach and another dude ruling over Megiddo.
Joshua,12,22,"Kedesh had one king, and Jokneam of Carmel had one king too."
Joshua,12,23,"The ruler of Dor in the chill coast of Dor, like, one dude; and also the ruler of the Gilgal nations, just one, you know?"
Joshua,12,24,"There was this dude who reigned in Tirzah, he's the only one from there. So yeah, there were like thirty other kings too, making it a total of thirty-one kings in the mix, you know?"
Joshua,13,1,"So Joshua was, like, really old and getting up there in years. And the LORD was like, 'Dude, you're seriously old now and not as young as you used to be, but there's still a ton of land that needs to be conquered and claimed. Like, seriously, there's a lot to do, man.'"
Joshua,13,2,"So basically, there's still this land left, you know? It's like the whole area of the Philistines and even Geshuri."
Joshua,13,3,"From Sihor, which is like right before Egypt, all the way up to the Ekron borders in the north, which is like part of Canaan: there are five big shots ruling over the Philistines - we've got the Gazathites, the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; plus the Avites too."
Joshua,13,4,"Going all the way down south, covering the whole territory of the Canaanites, including the spot called Mearah, which is right beside the Sidonians, extending until Aphek, reaching the borders of the Amorites. Mearah, by the way, is another name for 'the cave'."
Joshua,13,5,"And like, the Giblites' turf and all of Lebanon, towards where the sun comes up, from Baalgad to Mount Hermon and all the way to Hamath."
Joshua,13,6,"I'm gonna make sure all the peeps living in the hills from Lebanon to Misrephothmaim, including the Sidonians, get kicked out so the Israelite squad can take over. Just make sure you divide it up fairly through a lucky draw for the Israelites to inherit, like I told you to do."
Joshua,13,7,"So like, let's split up this land into portions for the nine tribes and, like, this half tribe called Manasseh."
Joshua,13,8,"The Reubenites and the Gadites got their land inheritance from Moses himself, on the east side of the Jordan River, just like the LORD's faithful servant Moses gave it to them."
Joshua,13,9,"From the town of Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and the city that sits in the middle of the river, and all the flat area of Medeba to Dibon;"
Joshua,13,10,"And, like, all the cities that this dude Sihon, who was the king of the Amorites, ruled over in Heshbon, all the way to the border of the Ammonites, you know."
Joshua,13,11,"And like, Gilead and the whole area of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and also like, all of mount Hermon, and all of Bashan all the way to Salcah;"
Joshua,13,12,"So, like, all of Og's kingdom in Bashan, you know, he was the ruler in Ashtaroth and Edrei. These were the last remaining giants, like, seriously. And then Moses came along and totally smacked them down and kicked them out."
Joshua,13,13,"But, like, the Israelite peeps didn't totally kick out the Geshurites or the Maachathites, ya know? So, like, these Geshurites and Maachathites still live among the Israelites even till today, man."
Joshua,13,14,"The tribe of Levi didn't get any land for themselves, but they got something special from the LORD God of Israel - making sacrifices with fire is their thing, just like He told them."
Joshua,13,15,"So Moses hooked up the crew from the tribe of Reuben with their land, you know, based on how their families were set up."
Joshua,13,16,"Their territory extended from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Arnon River, to the city located in the middle of the river, and encompassed the entire plain near Medeba."
Joshua,13,17,"Heshbon, and all the chill cities in the flatlands; Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon, the crib of Baal, and the lit house of Baalmeon"
Joshua,13,18,"And like, Jahazah, Kedemoth, and Mephaath,"
Joshua,13,19,"And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zarethshahar in the cool mountain valley,"
Joshua,13,20,"And also Bethpeor, Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth, which can be called like the springs of Pisgah, or, the hill."
Joshua,13,21,"And, like, all the cities in the flatlands and the entire kingdom of Sihon, who was like, the king of the Amorites and ruled over Heshbon. Moses totally destroyed this guy along with some other important dudes from Midian – Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba. These guys were like the top dogs in Sihon's land."
Joshua,13,22,"So, like, Israel totally took out Balaam, who was Beor's son and a total psychic, too. They just slayed him with their swords, along with all the other guys they took down. Just sayin', 'diviner' is another way to say 'soothsayer'."
Joshua,13,23,"So, like, the land that belonged to the Reubenites was all along the Jordan River and stuff. That was their piece of the pie, ya know? It included their families, the cool cities, and the chill villages."
Joshua,13,24,"So Moses hooked up the tribe of Gad with their inheritance, you know, the children of Gad got what they deserved based on their fam vibes."
Joshua,13,25,"And they had Jazer on their turf, along with all the lit cities in Gilead, and like half the land that belonged to the Ammonite crew, all the way to Aroer, fam, right before Rabbah."
Joshua,13,26,"And from Heshbon all the way to Ramathmizpeh, Betonim included; and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir;"
Joshua,13,27,"In the valley, there's Betharam, Bethnimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, along with the rest of Sihon's kingdom, who was the king of Heshbon. The Jordan River and its boundary stretch all the way to the edge of the Chinnereth sea on the east side of the river."
Joshua,13,28,"This is what the squad of Gad gets as their inheritance, like, the towns and chill spots where they can crash."
Joshua,13,29,"So Moses hooked up the half tribe of Manasseh with their property, and this is what the half tribe of Manasseh owned, split up by their different families."
Joshua,13,30,"Their territory stretched from Mahanaim to all of Bashan, including the entire kingdom ruled by King Og of Bashan, along with the numerous cities of Jair located in Bashan, totaling sixty cities in all."
Joshua,13,31,"And like, just so you know, like half of Gilead, Ashtaroth, and Edrei were cities that belonged to the kingdom of Og in Bashan. They were, like, totally owned by the children of Machir, who was the son of Manasseh. And like, not to be specific, but like half of the children of Machir claimed these cities as part of their families."
Joshua,13,32,"So, like, Moses totally divided up these countries for the peeps to inherit in the plains of Moab, right across the Jordan, near Jericho, on the east side."
Joshua,13,33,"But the tribe of Levi didn't get any land as inheritance from Moses. The LORD God of Israel was all they needed, just like He told them."
Joshua,14,1,"So, here's where the Israelites got their land in Canaan: Eleazar the priest, Joshua (Nun's son), and the big shots from the tribes made sure everyone got their fair share."
Joshua,14,2,"Their inheritance was chosen by drawing lots, just as the LORD commanded through Moses, for the nine tribes and the half tribe."
Joshua,14,3,"So like, Moses had hooked up two and a half tribes with land across the Jordan, but he didn't give the Levites any land of their own, you know?"
Joshua,14,4,"So, like, the kids of Joseph were split into two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim, and because of that they didn't give any land to the Levites, except for some cities where they could live, you know, and keep their animals and stuff."
Joshua,14,5,"Yo, the Lord was like, Mosess, do this!' So the kids of Israel were like, 'Totally, bro!' And they split up the land."
Joshua,14,6,"So, like, the peeps from Judah rolled up to Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb, son of Jephunneh, the Kenezite, was all like, 'Yo, you remember what the LORD told Moses, the man of God, about us when we were in Kadeshbarnea, right?'"
Joshua,14,7,"I was 40 years old when Moses, the servant of the LORD, sent me from Kadeshbarnea to check out the land. I told him exactly what I honestly felt about it."
Joshua,14,8,"But yo, my squad that rolled with me straight up made the peeps scared AF, but I stayed 100% loyal to the LORD my God."
Joshua,14,9,"And Moses was like, 'I swear, dude! Today I'm telling you, no doubt, the land where you've walked your kicks on will totally be yours and your kids' forever. Why? 'Cause you've been all in, completely following the LORD, my God!"
Joshua,14,10,"Yo, listen up. God has legit kept me alive, just like He promised, for a solid 45 years. He spoke these words to Moses way back when the whole Israel crew was trekking through the wilderness. And check it, today I'm rocking 85 years of life. Can't believe it, man. *wandered: Hebrew for walked*"
Joshua,14,11,"Yo, I'm still as fierce today as I was back when Moses sent me. My strength back then is still my strength now, both for battle and for movin' in and out!"
Joshua,14,12,"So, like, can I have this mountain that the LORD was talking about that one day? Because, you know, I heard back then that there were these Anakims there and that the cities were all big and strong. But, hey, if the LORD's got my back, I believe I can totally kick them out, just like He said."
Joshua,14,13,"Joshua gave Caleb, son of Jephunneh, a blessing and granted him Hebron as his inheritance."
Joshua,14,14,"So Hebron was given to Caleb, the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and it's his till today because he was fully committed to following the LORD, the God of Israel."
Joshua,14,15,"So, before it was called Hebron, it was known as Kirjatharba, where this dude named Arba, who was like a total legend among the Anakims, used to rule. And believe it or not, during that time, the land was finally able to chill out and have some peaceful moments without all the war drama going on."
Joshua,15,1,"So this is what went down for the tribe of Judah. Each fam repped their own territory, and their southern boundary reached all the way to Edom's border—specifically, the wild desert of Zin. That's as far south as it gets, my dudes."
Joshua,15,2,"And their southern border went from the beach of the salty sea, from the cool bay that faces towards the south: {bay: in Hebrew, they call it tongue}"
Joshua,15,3,"Then it went down to the cool spot called Maalehacrabbim, and continued on to Zin. From there, it climbed up the southern side all the way to Kadeshbarnea, then moved along to Hezron, and made its way up to Adar. Finally, it took a turn towards Karkaa and completed its journey. (Maalehacrebbim can also be known as the ascent to Acrabbim)"
Joshua,15,4,"So then it went towards Azmon and ended up at the river of Egypt, and the borders reached the sea. This is gonna be your southern border, just FYI."
Joshua,15,5,"The eastern boundary was like the salt sea, stretching all the way to the Jordan River. And their northern border started from the coastline, where the sea meets the Jordan River."
Joshua,15,6,"And the boundary went all the way to Bethhogla, then moved up to the northern side of Betharabah, and continued on to the famous rock named Bohan, who was Reuben's son:"
Joshua,15,7,"And the boundary went up towards Debir from the valley of Achor, and then northward, facing Gilgal, which is before the ascent to Adummim, on the south side of the river. And the boundary continued towards the springs of Enshemesh, and its limits reached Enrogel."
Joshua,15,8,"And the border went all the way up through the valley of the son of Hinnom to the really cool southern part of Jebusite (aka Jerusalem). Then the border continued up to the top of the mountain that faces the Hinnom valley on the west side, you know, at the end of the valley where the giants used to hang out in the north."
Joshua,15,9,"So basically, the border starts from the highest point of the hill and goes all the way to the water fountain of Nephtoah. Then it extends to the cities on Mount Ephron and reaches Baalah, also known as Kirjathjearim."
Joshua,15,10,"And the border went from Baalah all the way to mount Seir in the west, then continued to the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the north side. It went down to Bethshemesh and continued on to Timnah."
Joshua,15,11,"And the border went all the way to the side of Ekron to the north: and the border went towards Shicron, and ran along to mount Baalah, and reached to Jabneel; and the end of the border was at the sea."
Joshua,15,12,"So, like, the western boundary was, you know, the huge ocean and everything along it. That's basically where the peeps from the tribe of Judah settled, you know, all around, according to their fams."
Joshua,15,13,"And Caleb, son of Jephunneh, was blessed with a share in the land of Judah as commanded by the LORD to Joshua. He received the city of Arba, also known as Hebron, which was the hometown of Anak's father."
Joshua,15,14,"So, Caleb totally kicked out these three dudes named Anak's sons, Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, who happened to be these really big and strong guys."
Joshua,15,15,"Then he went to the people of Debir, and Debir used to be called Kirjathsepher."
Joshua,15,16,"So Caleb was like, yo, whoever straight up conquers Kirjathsepher and seizes it, I'll hook them up with my daughter Achsah as their wifey."
Joshua,15,17,"So Othniel, Kenaz's son and Caleb's brother, snagged it and scored Achsah, his babe, as his wifey."
Joshua,15,18,"So, as she approached him, she convinced him to request a piece of land from her father. And she hopped off her donkey, and Caleb asked her, 'What do you want?'}"
Joshua,15,19,"Then she was like, 'Yo, can you hook me up with a favor? You've already blessed me with some sweet land down south. Can you also bless me with some fresh water springs?' And the dude was cool and totally gave her both the springs, the ones up top and the ones down below."
Joshua,15,20,"This is what the tribe of the children of Judah gets as their inheritance, you know, based on their families and stuff."
Joshua,15,21,"The farthest cities in the tribe of the kids from Judah towards the Edom seaside in the south were Kabzeel, Eder, and Jagur."
Joshua,15,22,"And like, Kinah, Dimonah, and Adadah,"
Joshua,15,23,"And, like, Kedesh, Hazor, and Ithnan, you know?"
Joshua,15,24,"Ziph, Telem, and Bealoth, fam,"
Joshua,15,25,"And like, there's Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, ya know, and also Hezron, which is totally Hazor, you feel me?"
Joshua,15,26,"Amam, Shema, and Moladah, fam!"
Joshua,15,27,"And like, Hazargaddah, Heshmon, and Bethpalet or whatever,"
Joshua,15,28,"And like, Hazarshual, and Beersheba, and Bizjothjah,"
Joshua,15,29,"Baalah, Iim, and Azem, fam."
Joshua,15,30,"And then there's Eltolad, Chesil, and Hormah, of course."
Joshua,15,31,"And just like, Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,"
Joshua,15,32,"And like, there's Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon - these cities add up to twenty-nine, ya know, with all their villages and stuff:"
Joshua,15,33,"And down in the valley, Eshtaol, Zoreah, and Ashnah were there,"
Joshua,15,34,"And Zanoah, Engannim, Tappuah, and Enam,"
Joshua,15,35,"Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah - straight up game strong!"
Joshua,15,36,"And like, Sharaim, Adithaim, Gederah, and Gederothaim were, like, fourteen cities with their villages. And I mean Gederothaim too, you know?"
Joshua,15,37,"Zenan, Hadashah, and Migdalgad were on the map, peeps!"
Joshua,15,38,"And like, there's also Dilean, Mizpeh, and Joktheel, you know?"
Joshua,15,39,"Yoo, Lachish, Bozkath, and Eglon were the real OGs,"
Joshua,15,40,"And Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Kithlish, fam."
Joshua,15,41,"And there were Gederoth, Bethdagon, Naamah, and Makkedah; that's like sixteen cities along with their chill neighborhoods:"
Joshua,15,42,"So like, there's this like place called Libnah, and then you got Ether and Ashan, you know?"
Joshua,15,43,"And Jiphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,"
Joshua,15,44,"And like, there was Keilah, Achzib, and Mareshah, yo; like, nine cities with all their chill villages and stuff:"
Joshua,15,45,"Yo, check out Ekron and all its lit suburbs and chill neighborhoods:"
Joshua,15,46,"From Ekron to the sea, and all the surrounding areas of Ashdod, including their towns: near the place of."
Joshua,15,47,"Ashdod and all its little towns, Gaza and all its little towns, all the way to the river of Egypt, and the huge ocean, and the whole border of it:"
Joshua,15,48,"Also, up in the mountains, there are Shamir, Jattir, and Socoh,"
Joshua,15,49,"And also Dannah and Kirjathsannah, which is Debir,"
Joshua,15,50,"And Anab, like, Eshtemoh, and Anim, ya know?"
Joshua,15,51,"So there were these places called Goshen, Holon, and Giloh—like, eleven cities with all their chill little villages and stuff:"
Joshua,15,52,"Yo, there's Arab, Dumah, and Eshean, fam."
Joshua,15,53,"And by the way, there's Janum, Bethtappuah, and Aphekah, in case you were wondering. (Oh, and Janum might also go by the name Janus, just FYI.)"
Joshua,15,54,"And also Humtah, and Kirjatharba, which is like Hebron, and Zior; there's like nine cities and their chill villages:"
Joshua,15,55,"Yo, there's Maon, Carmel, Ziph, and Juttah!"
Joshua,15,56,"And like, there's Jezreel, Jokdeam, and Zanoah, you know?"
Joshua,15,57,"For real, these are the cities and towns: Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; a whole ten of them to be exact!"
Joshua,15,58,"Yo, Halhul, Bethzur, and Gedor,"
Joshua,15,59,"And there were like these cities, you know? Maarath, Bethanoth, and Eltekon, bro. There were like six cities, each with their own dope villages and all that."
Joshua,15,60,"Kirjathbaal, also known as Kirjathjearim, and Rabbah, were like, these two lit cities with all their surrounding villages, you know?"
Joshua,15,61,"Out in the middle of nowhere, we've got Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah."
Joshua,15,62,"And there's Nibshan, the city of Salt, and Engedi; six cities with all their villages and stuff."
Joshua,15,63,"So, like, the people of Judah, they weren't able to fully kick out the Jebusites who were living in Jerusalem, you know? So, the Jebusites ended up living alongside the people of Judah in Jerusalem up until today."
Joshua,16,1,"So, the land that was given to the descendants of Joseph extended from the Jordan River near Jericho, all the way to the eastern boundary of the water of Jericho. It included the wilderness that goes up from Jericho and throughout Mount Bethel."
Joshua,16,2,"Then they leave Bethel and head towards Luz, and continue on to the outskirts of Archi, reaching Ataroth."
Joshua,16,3,"And heads towards the sunset, reaching the Japhleti region, all the way to Bethhoron the lower and Gezer. And it ends at the sea."
Joshua,16,4,"So, like, Joseph's kids, Manasseh and Ephraim, got their piece of the pie."
Joshua,16,5,"The territory that belonged to the fam of Ephraim went like this: starting from Atarothaddar on the east, all the way to Bethhoron the upper"
Joshua,16,6,"And the border kept going towards the ocean to Michmethah up north; then it turned eastwards and reached Taanathshiloh, passing by it on the east to Janohah;"
Joshua,16,7,"It moved from Janohah to Ataroth, then to Naarath, and eventually reached Jericho, exiting at Jordan."
Joshua,16,8,"The border went from Tappuah towards the west all the way to the river Kanah, and it extends to the sea. This is the land that belongs to the tribe of Ephraim, inherited by their families."
Joshua,16,9,"So, like, the cities for the Ephraim fam were, ya know, part of the land given to the Manasseh fam, with all the cities and villages and stuff."
Joshua,16,10,"So, like, they totally didn't kick out those Canaanites who were living in Gezer. And get this, the Canaanites are still hanging around with the Ephraimites to this day, and they're basically paying them tribute and stuff."
Joshua,17,1,"The tribe of Manasseh got a big chunk too, since Manasseh was the oldest son of Joseph. Specifically, Machir, the oldest son of Manasseh and the guy who knew his way around a battle, scored Gilead and Bashan as his territories."
Joshua,17,2,"There was some land left for the rest of the kids from Manasseh's fam: for Abiezer's crew, Helek's squad, Asriel's peeps, Shechem's crew, Hepher's gang, and Shemida's posse. These were the boys from Manasseh, Joseph's son, reppin' their fams. (Abiezer was also known as Jeezer.)"
Joshua,17,3,"Yo, listen up! Zelophehad, son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, didn't have any bros, but check this out - he had five sisters! Their names are Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah."
Joshua,17,4,"So they went up to Eleazar the priest and Joshua, son of Nun, and the leaders, and said, 'Yo, the LORD told Moses to give us a piece of the land with our peeps. So, as the LORD commanded, he hooked them up with an inheritance just like their dad's homies got.'"
Joshua,17,5,"And Manasseh got ten parts, in addition to the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side of the Jordan River;"
Joshua,17,6,"So, like, the girls from Manasseh also got their piece of the inheritance, alongside the dudes. And the other sons of Manasseh, they got the land of Gilead, you know."
Joshua,17,7,"The territory of Manasseh went from Asher to Michmethah, which is in front of Shechem. The border continued on the right side toward the people of Entappuah."
Joshua,17,8,"So, Manasseh had this place called Tappuah, but it turns out that Tappuah was kinda in the territory of Manasseh, but it actually belonged to the cool kids, the children of Ephraim."
Joshua,17,9,"And the boundary went down to the Kanah River, south of the river. These cities of Ephraim are part of the cities of Manasseh. The boundary of Manasseh was also on the north side of the river, and it extended to the sea. (Kanah River means a trendy reed-filled stream)"
Joshua,17,10,"Like, the southern part belonged to Ephraim, and the northern part was like, totally Manasseh's territory, and the coast was their boundary. And they all like, connected in Asher in the north, and in Issachar in the east, you know?"
Joshua,17,11,"Manasseh had Bethshean and the surrounding towns in Issachar and Asher. He also had Ibleam and the surrounding towns, as well as Dor and the surrounding towns, Endor and the surrounding towns, Taanach and the surrounding towns, and Megiddo and the surrounding towns. That's like, three whole countries, dude."
Joshua,17,12,"But, like, the Manasseh kids totally couldn't kick out the peeps living in those cities, ya know? The Canaanites just stayed chillin' in the land and stuff."
Joshua,17,13,"So basically, when the Israelites got super strong, they made the Canaanites pay up, but they didn't completely kick them out of their land."
Joshua,17,14,"So like, the kids of Joseph were talking to Joshua and they were like, 'Dude, why did you only give us one piece of land? We're a massive tribe, man! God has blessed us so much till now!'"
Joshua,17,15,"Yo, Joshua was like, if y'all think you're so big and powerful, then head on up to the forested areas and start choppin' down trees in the land of the Perizzites and giants. If Mount Ephraim ain't spacious enough for ya, that is. (Giants, aka Rephaims for them nerds out there)"
Joshua,17,16,"The Joseph squad was like, yo this hill ain't cutting it for us. Plus, the Canaanite crew in the valley got some sick iron chariots. You know, the peeps from Bethshean and Jezreel? They're legit."
Joshua,17,17,"Joshua talked to the fam of Joseph, including Ephraim and Manasseh, and he was like, 'Yo, you guys are legit amazing, with mad strength. You ain't gonna settle for just one portion alone, fam.'"
Joshua,17,18,"But dude, you totally get to have that mountain! It's all forested and stuff, so you can totally chop it down. And yeah, all the surrounding areas are yours too. You're gonna kick out those Canaanites, even though they've got like iron chariots and are pretty tough."
Joshua,18,1,"So like, all the children of Israel got together at Shiloh, and they totally set up the tabernacle over there. And yeah, the land was totally under their control."
Joshua,18,2,"So, like, there were still seven tribes among the kids of Israel who hadn't gotten their share yet, you know?"
Joshua,18,3,"Yo, Joshua was like, guys, what's with the delay in takin' over the promised land the Lord God gave our ancestors?"
Joshua,18,4,"Yo, choose three homies from each tribe and I'll send them to check out the land. They gotta roam around and take notes on the different territories that belong to them. And then they'll come back to report to me."
Joshua,18,5,"And they gotta split it up into seven parts: Judah gonna chill in the south, and the tribe of Joseph gonna chill in the north."
Joshua,18,6,"So, like, divide the land into seven sections and bring the description to me, so I can draw lots for you right here, in front of the LORD our God."
Joshua,18,7,"Yo, listen up! The Levites don't get a piece of the action like everyone else. They got the priesthood of the LORD as their inheritance. As for Gad, Reuben, and half of Manasseh's tribe, they scored their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan River, thanks to Moses, the servant of the LORD."
Joshua,18,8,"So then, the dudes got up and bounced: and Joshua told them, those who were about to explore the land, he said, 'Yo, go and take a stroll through the land, check it out, and come back to me, so I can flip a coin for you in front of the LORD in Shiloh.'"
Joshua,18,9,"So the guys went and traveled around the land, checking out each city and writing down their observations in a book. Then they headed back to Joshua and the crew in Shiloh."
Joshua,18,10,"So Joshua was like, 'Hey guys, let's cast lots in Shiloh. We gotta figure out how to divide up this land amongst the Israelite peeps, you know, following the Lord's plan and all.'"
Joshua,18,11,"So, the tribe of Benjamin, like, got their portion of land based on their families. And their land was, like, right between the land of Judah and Joseph's tribe, you know?"
Joshua,18,12,"On the northern side, their territory stretched from the Jordan River all the way up to the outskirts of Jericho in the north. From there, it extended through the mountains towards the west, reaching the wilderness of Bethaven."
Joshua,18,13,"Then the border went from there towards Luz, to the side of Luz, which is Bethel, going south; and the border descended to Atarothadar, near the hill that is on the south side of the lower Bethhoron."
Joshua,18,14,"And then they marked the border and went around the corner of the sea towards the south, starting from the hill in front of Bethhoron, going all the way to Kirjathbaal, also known as Kirjathjearim, a city belonging to the children of Judah. This marked the western boundary."
Joshua,18,15,"Yo, so the southern part, right, it started from Kirjathjearim and went all the way to the west, reaching the well of waters of Nephtoah, you know?"
Joshua,18,16,"And the border went all the way to the edge of the mountain in front of the cool valley where the giant dudes live up north, then went down to the valley next to the city of those peeps called Jebusi on the south, and went all the way down to Enrogel."
Joshua,18,17,"Then it headed north, making its way to Enshemesh and continuing towards Geliloth, which is right by the Adummim pass. Finally, it descended to the stone of Bohan, Reuben's son."
Joshua,18,18,"And moved towards the area opposite Arabah to the north, and descended to Arabah: {Arabah: or, the plain}"
Joshua,18,19,"Then the border went along the side of Bethhoglah towards the north, and it ended at the northern part of the salt sea in the south of Jordan River. That was the southern boundary. (bay means tongue in Hebrew)"
Joshua,18,20,"And Jordan was, like, the boundary on the east side. This was the land the children of Benjamin got, you know, with their families spread all around it."
Joshua,18,21,"So, like, the cities that belonged to the tribe of Benjamin were totally Jericho, Bethhoglah, and the valley of Keziz."
Joshua,18,22,"And like, there's Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel, ya know?"
Joshua,18,23,"And like, there's Avim, Parah, and Ophrah, ya know?"
Joshua,18,24,"And there were like, Chepharhaammonai, Ophni, and Gaba, you know? They were all like, twelve cities and stuff, and they had, like, their own villages too, you know?"
Joshua,18,25,"Bruh, Gibeon, Ramah, and Beeroth,"
Joshua,18,26,"And like, Mizpeh, Chephirah, and Mozah, y'know?"
Joshua,18,27,"And like, there was also Rekem and Irpeel and Taralah, you know?"
Joshua,18,28,"And also Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which we now call Jerusalem, Gibeath, and Kirjath; a total of fourteen cities with all their surrounding areas. So, basically, that's what the children of Benjamin got as their property, based on their different families."
Joshua,19,1,"So, like, the next group, right, it was the tribe of Simeon. They got their land, you know, according to their families and stuff. And get this, their turf was actually inside the land that belonged to the children of Judah."
Joshua,19,2,"And they got Beersheba, or Sheba, and Moladah as their slice of land,"
Joshua,19,3,"And like, Hazarshual, Balah, and Azem,"
Joshua,19,4,"And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah, were like, totally part of the deal, ya know?"
Joshua,19,5,"And like, Ziklag, Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusah, ya know?"
Joshua,19,6,"And like, there were also Bethlebaoth and Sharuhen, you know? Like, a total of thirteen cities and their villages, all chillin' together, you feel me?"
Joshua,19,7,"Yo, check it out, there's Ain, Remmon, Ether, and Ashan, four lit cities with all their chill vibes and cozy villages:"
Joshua,19,8,"And all the towns that were nearby these cities, up to Baalathbeer and Ramath in the south. This is the land that belongs to the Simeon tribe and is passed down to their families."
Joshua,19,9,"So, basically, the kids from Judah had a lot of land, too much for them to handle. That's why the kids from Simeon got some of their land as their own inheritance, you know, within that whole setup."
Joshua,19,10,"So, the next thing that happened was Zebulun's turn. They drew the third lot, and it was all about their families. Their inheritance went all the way to Sarid, marking their border."
Joshua,19,11,"And they went up towards the ocean, and Maralah and extended to Dabbasheth, and extended to the river in front of Jokneam;"
Joshua,19,12,"And it went from Sarid towards the east, where the sun rises, all the way to the border of Chislothtabor. Then it continues on to Daberath and ascends to Japhia."
Joshua,19,13,"And then it goes towards the east to Gittahhepher, to Ittahkazin, and ends at Remmonmethoar near Neah; {methoar: or, which is drawn}"
Joshua,19,14,"And on the north side, it goes around to Hannathon, and ends in the valley of Jiphthahel."
Joshua,19,15,"And like, there were Kattath, Nahallal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem, y'know? Like, these were twelve chill cities along with their villages."
Joshua,19,16,"This is what the squad of Zebulun peeps get as their legacy, you know? These lit cities and all their chill villages, fam."
Joshua,19,17,"And then, like, the fourth pick was Issachar, you know? Like, they got the land and stuff for the children of Issachar and all their fams."
Joshua,19,18,"Their turf extended towards Jezreel, Chesulloth, and Shunem,"
Joshua,19,19,"And like, Hapharaim, and Shion, and Anaharath,"
Joshua,19,20,"And I also found Rabbith, Kishion, and Abez,"
Joshua,19,21,"And also Remeth, Engannim, Enhaddah, and Bethpazzez;"
Joshua,19,22,"And the area extends to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and Bethshemesh; and the boundary of their region extended to the Jordan River: sixteen cities along with their suburbs."
Joshua,19,23,"This is what the tribe of Issachar got as their inheritance, like, based on their families and stuff - you know, the cities and villages they got."
Joshua,19,24,"And like, the fifth lot was like chosen for the tribe of Asher, you know, for their fams and stuff."
Joshua,19,25,"And their area was like Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,"
Joshua,19,26,"And don't forget Alammelech, Amad, and Misheal; the vibe even extends all the way to Carmel in the west and Shihorlibnath."
Joshua,19,27,"Then it goes eastwards to Bethdagon, and extends to Zebulun and the valley of Jiphthahel on the north side of Bethemek. It also includes Neiel and ends at Cabul on the left side."
Joshua,19,28,"And Hebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, all the way to the awesome city of Zidon;"
Joshua,19,29,"And then the shoreline goes towards Ramah and the cool city Tyre. It also goes towards Hosah, and its borders reach all the way to the sea, extending from the coast to Achzib."
Joshua,19,30,"Oh, by the way, there were also Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob – a total of twenty-two cities with their villages."
Joshua,19,31,"So basically, this is what the tribe of Asher gets as their inheritance. It's all about these cool cities and their nearby villages that belong to them."
Joshua,19,32,"So the next spot was given to the Naphtali crew, to the Naphtali fam, just keepin' it in the fam."
Joshua,19,33,"And their territory extended from Heleph to Allon, Zaanannim, Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, all the way to Lakum, and its borders reached the Jordan River."
Joshua,19,34,"Then the coastline goes westward to Aznothtabor, and continues to Hukkok, reaching Zebulun on the southern side, extending to Asher on the western side, and to Judah by the Jordan River towards the sunrise."
Joshua,19,35,"And these are the fortified cities: Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,"
Joshua,19,36,"Yo, check out Adamah, Ramah, and Hazor,"
Joshua,19,37,"And like, there were also Kedesh, Edrei, and Enhazor, ya know?"
Joshua,19,38,"And like, there were these dope cities man, like Iron, Migdalel, Horem, Bethanath, and Bethshemesh, yo! It's like, a total of nineteen chill cities with their cozy villages, you know?"
Joshua,19,39,This is what the tribe of Naphtali gets as their inheritance. It includes cities and villages for each of their families.
Joshua,19,40,"So, like, the last tribe to get their territory was Dan, you know? It was all planned out, according to their fams and stuff."
Joshua,19,41,"So, their turf included Zorah, Eshtaol, and Irshemesh,"
Joshua,19,42,"And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah,"
Joshua,19,43,"And Elon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron,"
Joshua,19,44,"And like, there were also Eltekeh, Gibbethon, and Baalath,"
Joshua,19,45,"And Jehud, and Beneberak, and Gathrimmon, fam!"
Joshua,19,46,"And Mejarkon and Rakkon were like, right near Japho. Like, they were right across from it or something. But you know, Japho is also called Joppa."
Joshua,19,47,"So, like, the land that the tribe of Dan got was, like, not enough for them. So, they were like, 'we need more!' And they went and fought against Leshem and totally won. They went all sword-fighting mode and took over Leshem, living there and naming it Dan, after their dad Dan."
Joshua,19,48,"So, like, this is what the tribe of Dan got as their inheritance, you know, for their fams and stuff. It's a bunch of cities and villages and all that."
Joshua,19,49,"Once they finished dividing up the land for everyone to inherit, the kids of Israel hooked up Joshua, son of Nun, with some prime real estate too:"
Joshua,19,50,"So, like, because God said it, they gave him the city he wanted, ya know, Timnathserah in mount Ephraim. And he, like, totally built the city and lived there."
Joshua,19,51,"Yo, check it out, these are the lands that Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the leaders of the tribes of Israel divided up as inheritances. They did it by drawing lots in Shiloh, right in front of the LORD's crib, aka the tabernacle. And that's how they wrapped it up, all the land got divided and stuff."
Joshua,20,1,"Yo, the LORD straight up talked to Joshua like,"
Joshua,20,2,"Yo, listen up, Israelites! God's got a message for y'all. He wants you to choose some safe havens, like cities of refuge, just like He told Moses before."
Joshua,20,3,"If someone accidentally takes someone's life without realizing it, they can go to those designated places and find safety from the one seeking revenge."
Joshua,20,4,"So, like, when someone runs to one of those cool cities, they gotta go to the entrance and talk to the wise old heads of the city about what's up. And if they find out it's legit, they'll totally let them stay in the city and hook them up with a place to live. How rad is that?"
Joshua,20,5,"And if someone seeking vengeance comes after them, they shouldn't hand over the person who killed accidentally and had no previous hatred towards them."
Joshua,20,6,"And he'll live in that city until he appears before the gang for a decision, until the high priest who is in charge during that time dies. Then the one who accidentally caused someone's death can go back to their hometown, their own house, to the city they ran away from."
Joshua,20,7,"So they set up Kedesh in Galilee on Mount Naphtali, and Shechem on Mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba (also known as Hebron) in the hills of Judah."
Joshua,20,8,"And on the other side of the Jordan, by Jericho in the east, they designated Bezer in the middle of nowhere, from the Reuben tribe, Ramoth in Gilead from the Gad tribe, and Golan in Bashan from the Manasseh tribe."
Joshua,20,9,"These were the cities set for all the Israel fam, and for any out-of-towner chillin' with them. If anyone accidentally takes a life, they can book it to these cities and dodge gettin' murked by the revenge squad, until they face the community court."
Joshua,21,1,"After that, the top dudes from the Levites, the fathers of the gangs, slid up to Eleazar the priest and Joshua, son of Nun. They also spoke to the big shots from the tribes of Israel."
Joshua,21,2,"So like, they were talking to them at Shiloh in Canaan, and they were all like, 'Yo, the LORD totally commanded through Moses that we need some cities to live in, you know? Plus, we gotta have suburbs for our cattle, 'cause they need space too."
Joshua,21,3,"So, like, the peeps of Israel gave the Levites some of their land, because the Lord said so, ya know? These cities and their chill neighborhoods, all given to the Levites."
Joshua,21,4,"And they drew lots for the Kohathite families: and the kids of Aaron, who were from the Levites, got assigned cities through the lottery from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin - a total of thirteen cities."
Joshua,21,5,"So, the rest of the kids from the Kohath crew got their spots in the city lottery. Some ended up in Ephraim's tribe, others in Dan's, and a few in the half tribe of Manasseh. We're talking a total of ten cities for them."
Joshua,21,6,"So, the Gershonites were given thirteen cities through lots, from the families of the tribe of Issachar, the tribe of Asher, the tribe of Naphtali, and the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan."
Joshua,21,7,"So the kids from the Merari crew, from the Reuben fam, from the Gad squad, and from the Zebulun tribe, scored themselves twelve lit cities."
Joshua,21,8,"So, like, the Israelites were all like, drawing lots and stuff, to assign these cities with their surrounding areas to the Levites. And yeah, they were just following the instructions that the LORD gave through Moses, you know?"
Joshua,21,9,"Okay, so they picked some cities from the tribes of Judah and Simeon. These are the ones they mentioned by name, you know?"
Joshua,21,10,"The kids of Aaron, from the cool fams of the Kohathites, who were from the tribe of Levi, had this swaggy possession. It was like, the sickest thing ever, 'cause they got the top spot."
Joshua,21,11,"So they let them have the city of Arba, Anak's dad, which is Hebron, up in the hills of Judah, along with all the cool surrounding areas. (Or, you could say, Kirjatharba)"
Joshua,21,12,"Bruh, they straight up hooked Caleb, son of Jephunneh, up with the fields and villages of the city as his own property. No cap."
Joshua,21,13,"So they hooked up the priest Aaron's crew with Hebron and its chill surroundings, making it a safe spot for people who accidentally took a life. Libnah and its chill surroundings were also part of the deal."
Joshua,21,14,"And Jattir, like, the whole gang's there, and Eshtemoa, you know, with all its chill surroundings,"
Joshua,21,15,"And Holon, you know, and all the chill suburbs around it, and Debir, which is also known as Hilen and stuff, with its suburbs."
Joshua,21,16,"And Ain, you know, with all its chill suburbs, and Juttah, like, with its rad suburbs, and oh yeah, Bethshemesh with its epic suburbs; a total of nine cities from those two tribes. Ain, by the way, is also known as Ashan."
Joshua,21,17,"And from the tribe of Benjamin, we had Gibeon and its nearby areas, Geba (also known as Gaba) and its nearby areas."
Joshua,21,18,"So there were four cities: Anathoth and its suburbs, Almon (also known as Alemeth) and its suburbs."
Joshua,21,19,"So, like, all the cities that belonged to Aaron's crew, the priests, were a total of thirteen cities and their chill outskirts."
Joshua,21,20,"So, like, the Kohathites, who were from the tribe of Levi, y'know, they were given cities to live in that were in the land belonging to the tribe of Ephraim."
Joshua,21,21,They gave Shechem and its surrounding areas in mount Ephraim as a safe haven for the person who accidentally killed someone; and also Gezer with its surrounding areas.
Joshua,21,22,"And like, Kibzaim was totally there with its chill neighborhoods, along with Bethhoron and its suburbs, making it a total of four hip cities."
Joshua,21,23,"And from the tribe of Dan, we got Eltekeh and Gibbethon, along with all their chill neighborhoods."
Joshua,21,24,"Aijalon, chillin' with her crew, Gathrimmon, kickin' it with her posse; four sick cities."
Joshua,21,25,"And from the half tribe of Manasseh, we've got Tanach and her surrounding areas, and Gathrimmon with her surrounding areas; two cities in total."
Joshua,21,26,"So, like, all the cities, ya know, there were ten of 'em, and they had these cool suburbs for the families of the children of Kohath that were still around."
Joshua,21,27,"And to the Gershon crew, from the Levite fams, reppin' half of Manasseh, they hooked up Golan in Bashan with its hood, as a safe zone for a homie who accidentally killed someone; and Beeshterah with its hood too, two chill cities."
Joshua,21,28,"From the Issachar fam, we got Kishon with its chill neighborhoods and Dabareh with its lit suburbs,"
Joshua,21,29,"Jarmuth and Engannim, along with the places around them, all together make up four cool cities."
Joshua,21,30,"And from the Asher fam, we got Mishal and her crew, Abdon and his squad,"
Joshua,21,31,"Helkath and its chill hangouts, and Rehob with its dope hangouts; four lit cities."
Joshua,21,32,"And Naphtali's crew claimed Kedesh in Galilee as their chill hangout spot, where you could escape the heat if you accidentally took someone out. They also had Hammothdor and Kartan as their backup venues - three happening cities in total."
Joshua,21,33,"So, like, the Gershonites had a total of thirteen cities with their suburbs, ya know, all divided according to their fams and stuff."
Joshua,21,34,"To the squad of the Merari fam, the leftover Levites from Zebulun's tribe, they got Jokneam and Kartah with their chill neighborhoods."
Joshua,21,35,"Dimnah and its surrounding areas, Nahalal and its surrounding areas, four cities."
Joshua,21,36,"And from the squad of Reuben, Bezer with its chill hangouts, and Jahazah with its trendy spots,"
Joshua,21,37,"Kedemoth flexin' with its surroundings, and Mephaath be vibin' with its surroundings; a total of four lit cities."
Joshua,21,38,"And from the tribe of Gad, we got Ramoth in Gilead with its chill neighborhood, as a safe spot for someone who accidentally took a life; and Mahanaim with its cool hangout spots."
Joshua,21,39,"Heshbon and its surrounding areas, Jazer and its surrounding areas; a total of four cities."
Joshua,21,40,"So, like, all the cool cities that the peeps from the fam of Merari, you know, the leftover Levites, got assigned in, like, a lottery, were a solid twelve cities."
Joshua,21,41,"So, basically, the Israelite peeps had a total of 48 cities including the chill Levites in their hood, complete with their suburbs and all. No cap."
Joshua,21,42,These cities had their suburbs all around them: that's how all these cities were.
Joshua,21,43,"So, like, God totally hooked up Israel with all the land that He promised to their ancestors, and they actually got to live there and make it their home, no cap."
Joshua,21,44,"And God totally hooked them up with chill vibes all around, just like He promised their parents. None of their enemies could even bring it; God totally handed over all their enemies to them."
Joshua,21,45,"God totally came through on all the awesome things He promised to the Israelites. Every single one of 'em happened, no doubt!"
Joshua,22,1,"So Joshua hit up the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the Manasseh squad (half tribe) on a group chat,"
Joshua,22,2,"And like, he you know, was all like, 'Yo, you guys totally followed every single thing that Moses, the servant of the LORD, told you to do. And you like, totally listened to me too, and did everything that I told you to do. Major props, fam!"
Joshua,22,3,"You haven't ditched your homies for a hot minute, and you've been loyal to keeping God's commandments."
Joshua,22,4,"Yo, fam! Check it, the LORD your God has totally hooked up your squad with some mad rest, just like He promised, ya know? So yo, it's time for all of y'all to bounce and head back to your tents and chill in the land that Moses, the servant of the LORD, hooked y'all up with on the other side of Jordan. Yeah, you got this, my dudes!"
Joshua,22,5,"Yo, listen up and pay close attention to this: make sure you always follow the commandments and laws set by Moses, who was the Lord's servant. It's all about showing love and devotion to the Almighty, by living according to His ways, keeping His commandments, sticking with Him through thick and thin, and fully dedicating yourself to serving Him with all your heart and soul."
Joshua,22,6,"So Joshua gave them a shoutout, and let them bounce: and they went back to their crib."
Joshua,22,7,"So, like, Moses gave, you know, part of the tribe of Manasseh some land in Bashan, but Joshua gave the other half of the tribe land on this side of the Jordan in the west. And when Joshua sent them back to their homes, he totally blessed them."
Joshua,22,8,"And he was like, yo, go back to your tents and bring back heaps of riches. Get lots of cattle, silver, gold, brass, iron, and mad clothes too. Share the spoils of your enemies with your bros."
Joshua,22,9,"Then the squad of Reuben, Gad, and half of Manasseh bounced and dipped out from the fam of Israel in Shiloh, in the lit land of Canaan, to head to Gilead, their turf, as the LORD told 'em through Moses."
Joshua,22,10,"So, when they reached the outskirts of Jordan, which is in Canaan, the peeps from Reuben, Gad, and half of Manasseh set up a sick altar by the river, and it was HUGE!"
Joshua,22,11,"So, like, word got around to the Israelites that the Reubenites, Gadites, and half of the Manassites went and built this sick altar across from Canaan, near the Jordan River where the Israelites were passing through."
Joshua,22,12,"And when the Israelites found out about it, all the peeps of Israel came together at Shiloh, ready to throw down in battle against them."
Joshua,22,13,"So the Israelites hit up the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the Manasseh crew who were chilling in Gilead, and asked Phinehas, Eleazar's son and priest, to come through."
Joshua,22,14,"And he had ten squad leaders with him, one from each major household in all the tribes of Israel. Each one was the leader of their own family's house, among the thousands of Israel."
Joshua,22,15,"So they went to the kids of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh's half tribe, specifically to the land of Gilead, and had a chat with them, saying,"
Joshua,22,16,"Yo, listen up fam, the whole squad of the Almighty is like, yo, what wrong move is this that y'all pulled on the big man upstairs? Why you gotta ditch Him today and go ahead building yourself some mad altar trying to start a rebellion against the big G?"
Joshua,22,17,"Yo, the sin of Peor ain't just some small thing for us. We still ain't gotten rid of it, even after all this time. And check it, there was a serious plague goin' down among the Lord's crew."
Joshua,22,18,"So, are you seriously thinking about ditching the LORD today? Like, if you really rebel against the LORD today, don't even trip, 'cause tomorrow He's gonna be totally furious with the entire crew of Israel."
Joshua,22,19,"So, like, if the land you own is, like, all dirty and stuff, then you should go to the land that the Lord owns, where His tabernacle is, and, you know, settle there with us. But, like, don't go against the Lord or us by building your own altar next to the altar of our God, okay?"
Joshua,22,20,"Yo, remember when Achan, Zerah's son, straight up messed up? He went and took some forbidden stuff, and because of that, the whole Israel gang got in trouble. And let me tell you, that dude didn't suffer the consequences alone for his wrongdoing."
Joshua,22,21,"So like, the kids from Reuben and Gad and like, half of Manasseh, they, you know, spoke up and were all like, 'Hey, leaders of the thousands in Israel, listen up!'"
Joshua,22,22,"The super awesome God, the absolute best ever, totally knows everything, and he will totally know what's up with Israel; like, if they're rebelling or doing something against God, then don't save them today,"
Joshua,22,23,"If we've made an altar to ditch following the LORD, or if we're all about those burnt offerings or fancy food offerings, or even if we offer peace offerings there, the LORD should totally call us out on it."
Joshua,22,24,"And if we didn't do it because we were scared of this situation, thinking that in the future your kids might ask our kids, 'What's your deal with the God of Israel?'"
Joshua,22,25,"Because God has set the Jordan River as a boundary between us and you, Reuben and Gad's fam, you won't have any share with God. As a result, your kids will influence our kids to stop revering God."
Joshua,22,26,"So, we were like, yo, let's get ready to build an altar, but not for like, burning stuff or making sacrifices or whatever:"
Joshua,22,27,"So that it becomes like a receipt for all of us, you, and all the people who come after us. This way, we can show that we're doing our part for the LORD by making our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and peace offerings. This is to make sure that your kids don't diss our kids later and say they don't have any connection to the LORD."
Joshua,22,28,"So we were like, okay, here's the deal: in the future, when people ask us or our peeps about it, we can totally show them the altar blueprint that our dads made. But, just FYI, it's not for burning stuff or sacrifices. It's more like a symbol of the bond between us and you guys."
Joshua,22,29,"No way we're gonna dis the LORD and ditch Him today, just to set up our own altar for offerings and sacrifices, like seriously, bro, right next to the LORD's altar in front of His crib."
Joshua,22,30,"So, like, Phinehas, the priest dude, and the cool leaders of the Israel gang, heard what the peeps from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh were saying, and they were totally down with it. It was like, good vibes all around, ya know?"
Joshua,22,31,"Yo, Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, straight up told the peeps from Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh, that today we can totally tell that the LORD is with us, because you didn't go and mess up by doing something against the LORD. So basically, you've like totally saved the children of Israel from the hand of the LORD. Like, for real."
Joshua,22,32,"Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, along with the bosses, came back from hanging out with the peeps from Reuben and Gad in Gilead and went back to Canaan to give the children of Israel the latest news."
Joshua,22,33,"The Israelites were totally cool with it, and they gave major props to God. They had no plans to start a fight and wreck the land where the peeps from Reuben and Gad were living."
Joshua,22,34,"So, like, the kids of Reuben and Gad named the altar 'Ed' because it's supposed to, like, symbolize that the LORD is our God and, you know, it's, like, a legit testimony and stuff. 'Ed' means, like, a witness and all."
Joshua,23,1,"So, like, a really long time passed after the LORD gave Israel a break from all their enemies that were causing trouble, and Joshua, he got old and everything, like really old."
Joshua,23,2,"So Joshua gathered all the fam of Israel, including the OGs, the leaders, the judges, and the squad, and he was like, 'Y'all, I've been around the block, and I'm getting up there in years.'"
Joshua,23,3,And you've witnessed all the sick moves the LORD your God pulled on all those nations because of you; 'cause the LORD your God is the one who's been rocking it out for you.
Joshua,23,4,"Yo fam, listen up. I've split these leftover nations among y'all by drawing lots, so you can claim 'em as your inheritance for each tribe. It's from the Jordan River, all the way to the west, where I've wiped out all the other nations. #sunsetvibes #blessed"
Joshua,23,5,"And God, like, totally gonna kick them outta here, get them outta your sight, and you'll totally have their land just like God promised you."
Joshua,23,6,"So, like, you gotta be super brave and committed to doing everything that's written in the book of the law of Moses, ya know? Don't stray off course to the right or left, just stay focused and stay strong!"
Joshua,23,7,Don't hang out with these other nations that are still around you. Don't even talk about their gods or swear by them. Don't worship them or bow down to them.
Joshua,23,8,"Stay loyal to the LORD your God, just like you've been all along. {Stay loyal...: or, If you stay loyal... etc}"
Joshua,23,9,"Yo, God totally kicked out all those big and strong nations for you. And, like, no one could even stand up to you up until now. It's legit impressive, bro!"
Joshua,23,10,"Listen up, fam! Just one of you can straight up flex on a whole thousand peeps. Why? 'Cause the almighty LORD, your God, is the one who's got your back and fights for you, just like He promised. Periodt."
Joshua,23,11,"So, like, make sure you're super careful to love the LORD your God with all your soul, okay?"
Joshua,23,12,"But if y'all go and cling to the leftover nations that are still around, getting hitched and all with them, and, you know, doing the dirty together..."
Joshua,23,13,"Yo fam, just wanna make sure you get this straight. The big man upstairs, aka the LORD your God, ain't gonna kick out any of those nations in front of you no more. Instead, they're gonna be like straight-up traps and whips on your back, poking you in the eyes like mad thorns, until you straight up vanish from this amazing land the LORD your God hooked you up with."
Joshua,23,14,"Yo, listen up! Today, I'm about to do what everyone eventually does and leave this world. But deep down, in your hearts and souls, you know that every single amazing thing that the LORD your God promised has totally come true. Not one of those things has fallen through the cracks or been left undone."
Joshua,23,15,"So, basically, here's the deal: just like all the cool stuff that God promised would happen to you actually happened, now it's time for the not-so-cool stuff. God's gonna bring some not-so-fun things your way until you're completely wiped out of this awesome land that God hooked you up with."
Joshua,23,16,"If you break the deal with the LORD your God that he told you to follow by worshiping other gods and bowing down to them, it's gonna make the LORD really mad and you'll disappear real fast from the awesome land he gave to you."
Joshua,24,1,"So Joshua brought together all the groups of Israel to Shechem and summoned the OGs, the top dogs, the judges, and the officials. And they all showed up to flex in front of God."
Joshua,24,2,"Joshua was like, 'Yo, everyone listen up. This is what the LORD God of Israel says: Your ancestors lived on the other side of this huge river a long time ago. We're talking about Terah, Abraham's dad, and Nachor's dad too. And they were into worshipping other gods and stuff."
Joshua,24,3,"So, like, I totally picked your dad Abraham from across the big flood and guided him all over Canaan, yo! And, no cap, I made his fam grow like crazy and blessed him with a son named Isaac."
Joshua,24,4,"So, like, I gave Isaac two sons, Jacob and Esau. And then I gave Esau this awesome place called mount Seir to own, ya know? But Jacob and his crew ended up heading down to Egypt for some reason."
Joshua,24,5,"So, Moses and Aaron were totally sent by me, and I totally wrecked Egypt with all the crazy stuff I did there. But don't worry, after that chaotic adventure, I totally rescued you all and brought you out of there."
Joshua,24,6,"So, like, I totally rescued your ancestors from Egypt, and you guys were at the sea, right? And guess what, the Egyptians were all like, chasing your ancestors with their fancy chariots and horsemen, until they reached the Red Sea. Crazy, right?!"
Joshua,24,7,"And when they hit up the LORD, he flexed and made it dark between you and the Egyptians, and straight up brought the sea on them, and covered them up real good; and you saw with your own eyes the epic stuff I did in Egypt: and y'all chilled in the wilderness for a hot minute."
Joshua,24,8,"So, I took you to this place called the land of the Amorites, on the other side of the Jordan River. They tried to fight with you, but I totally handed their butts over to you, so you could claim their land as your own. And guess what? I straight-up destroyed them right in front of you. No competition."
Joshua,24,9,"So, like, this dude Balak, son of Zippor, who was the king of Moab, got all up in arms and started a fight against Israel. And then he was all like, 'Yo, Balaam, son of Beor, I need you to curse these guys for me!'"
Joshua,24,10,"But I didn't listen to Balaam, so he still ended up blessing you. That's how I saved you from his grasp."
Joshua,24,11,"So you crossed the Jordan River and arrived in Jericho, and the people of Jericho straight-up battled against you. They were like, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. But yo, I totally handed them over to you. Like, mission accomplished."
Joshua,24,12,"I totally unleashed a swarm of killer hornets on those dudes, straight up kicking them outta your way. And get this—those two Amorite kings? Yeah, I didn't even need you to bust out your sword or bow. They were toast without 'em, no cap."
Joshua,24,13,"So basically, I hooked you up with this awesome land that you didn't even bust your butt for. You got cities that you didn't even have to build, and now you're chilling in them. You're chowing down on vineyards and olive groves that you didn't even bother planting. Enjoy the fruits of my labor, fam!"
Joshua,24,14,"So listen up, fam. It's time to show some respect to the LORD and serve Him with mad authenticity and honesty. We gotta ditch all those idols that our ancestors used to worship back in the day, whether it was across the land or in Egypt. It's all about repping the LORD now, straight up."
Joshua,24,15,"If you're not feeling down with serving the LORD, it's all good, you do you! Decide right now who you wanna serve - the gods your ancestors worshipped back in the day, or the gods of the Amorites whose land you're chillin' in. But for me and my crew, we're stickin' with the LORD."
Joshua,24,16,"And the people were like, no way, we ain't giving up on the LORD to worship other gods!"
Joshua,24,17,"Like, dude, the LORD our God totally brought us and our ancestors out of Egypt, you know? We were trapped and stuff, but God did all these epic miracles right in front of us. He totally watched over us the whole time we were wandering, even when we encountered all these different groups of people."
Joshua,24,18,"And, like, God totally kicked out all those people, ya know, the Amorites who were living in the land. So, yeah, we're totally gonna serve the LORD 'cause He's our God, no doubt!"
Joshua,24,19,"And Joshua was like, listen up, folks, there's no way we can serve the LORD, because He's, like, super holy and, yeah, He's a bit of a jealous God too. So, don't expect Him to just forgive all your mistakes and sins, 'cause that's not how He rolls. Just so you know, holy God in Hebrew is like holy Gods or something."
Joshua,24,20,"If you ditch the LORD and start simping for random gods, he's gonna ghost you and mess you up real bad, even after he's been super good to you."
Joshua,24,21,"And the peeps were like, 'Nah, Joshua, we got you. We're gonna stay loyal and serve the LORD.'"
Joshua,24,22,"And Joshua was like, listen up guys, you totally know that you chose the LORD to be your main one. And the people were like, yup, we totally know. We're witnesses and all."
Joshua,24,23,"So yeah, get rid of those weird gods you've got hanging around, and like, focus your heart on the LORD God of Israel."
Joshua,24,24,"And the squad was like, yo Joshua, we're down to serve the LORD our God and totally follow his voice, no doubt."
Joshua,24,25,"And Joshua, like, totally made a pact with the people that day, and, like, gave them some rules and instructions in Shechem."
Joshua,24,26,"So Joshua wrote down these words in the sacred book of God's law, and placed a massive rock next to the holy place of the Lord."
Joshua,24,27,"So Joshua was like, yo, listen up fam! This stone right here, it's gonna be our witness. It's heard everything the Lord has said to us. So, don't even try to deny your God, 'cause this stone's got the receipts and it's gonna testify for us."
Joshua,24,28,"So Joshua was like, 'Alright guys, you're free to bounce and go back to your own lands.'"
Joshua,24,29,"So, like, after all that happened, Joshua, who's the son of Nun and a total servant of the LORD, passed away at the ripe age of 110."
Joshua,24,30,"And they laid him to rest in Timnathserah, which was in the mountains of Ephraim, on the chill north side of the hill of Gaash."
Joshua,24,31,"So, like, Israel totally dedicated themselves to the LORD throughout the whole time Joshua was in charge. And even after Joshua and the OG elders passed away, the ones who witnessed all the epic things the LORD did for Israel, they still stayed faithful. Can you believe it? That's just mind-blowing, man."
Joshua,24,32,"The Israelites took Joseph's bones up from Egypt and buried them in Shechem, on a piece of land that Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor (Shechem's dad) for a hundred silver coins. This spot became the property of Joseph's descendants. (The coins could also be called lambs, just so you know.)"
Joshua,24,33,"So Eleazar, Aaron's son, passed away and they laid him to rest on a hill that Phinehas, his son, got in Mount Ephraim."
Judges,1,1,"So, Joshua died and the Israelite peeps were like, 'Yo, Lord, who's gonna lead us in battling the Canaanites?"
Judges,1,2,"God was like, 'Yo, Judah gonna take over. Check it out, I made him victorious over the land.'"
Judges,1,3,"And Judah was like, 'Yo, Simeon, let's team up and take on those Canaanites in my territory. And I'll totally have your back when we fight in your turf too, bro.' So Simeon was like, 'Sure thing, man. I'm down.' And they rolled together."
Judges,1,4,"So Judah went up, and with God's help, they defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites. They took down a whopping ten thousand men in Bezek!"
Judges,1,5,"So they tracked down this dude Adonibezek in Bezek, and they straight up had a battle with him. And guess what? They totally wiped out those Canaanites and Perizzites!"
Judges,1,6,"So Adonibezek ran away, but they chased after him and caught him, giving him a major 'oopsie' by hacking off his thumbs and big toes."
Judges,1,7,"Adonibezek was like, 'Bro, I had like 70 kings rollin' up to me with no thumbs and toes, beggin' for scraps under my table. And you know what? God totally gave me what I deserved. They took him to Jerusalem, and that's where he kicked the bucket, man."
Judges,1,8,"So, like, the kids from Judah, they were totally like fighting against Jerusalem, and they actually took over the place, and like, totally attacked it with swords and set the whole city on fire."
Judges,1,9,"And then the kids from Judah decided to go down and take on the Canaanites who were living in the mountains, down south, and in the low country."
Judges,1,10,"So Judah totally took on those Canaanites in Hebron, like, the place used to be called Kirjatharba before, ya know? And they straight up defeated Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai."
Judges,1,11,"Then he headed towards the people in Debir, which used to be called Kirjathsepher:"
Judges,1,12,"And Caleb was like, if anyone totally destroys Kirjathsepher and captures it, I'll totally hook them up with my daughter Achsah as their wifey."
Judges,1,13,"So, Othniel, bro of Caleb, totally claimed it and married Achsah, his daughter. No biggie."
Judges,1,14,"So, like, when she arrived, she convinced him to ask her dad for a piece of land, and she got off her donkey. And Caleb was all like, 'What do you want?'"
Judges,1,15,"And she was like, yo, bless me, 'cause you already hooked me up with some land down south. How 'bout you hook me up with some water too? And Caleb was like, bet, here you go - the fancy springs and the regular springs."
Judges,1,16,"So like, the Kenite fam, who are like Moses' in-laws, they left the city with all the palm trees and teamed up with the Judah squad to head into the wild desert in Judah, down south near Arad. And they all just chilled together with the locals, y'know."
Judges,1,17,"So Judah and Simeon rolled up together, and they straight up wiped out the Canaanites living in Zephath. They completely wrecked that city, and it was called Hormah after that."
Judges,1,18,"So, like, Judah totally conquered Gaza and all the places nearby, like Askelon and Ekron and their surrounding areas."
Judges,1,19,"And God was like totally on Judah's side, and they totally dominated the peeps living in the mountains. But they couldn't totally remove the peeps living in the valley 'cause they had some seriously rad iron chariots. Like, impossible to beat!"
Judges,1,20,"So they handed Hebron over to Caleb, just like Moses said, and he kicked out those three Anakite guys from there."
Judges,1,21,"So, like, the peeps from Benjamin didn't kick out the Jebusites, who were living in Jerusalem. They, like, decided to share the city... and, believe it or not, they're still chillin' together in Jerusalem even now!"
Judges,1,22,"And yo, the squad of Joseph was like, 'Let's go up to Bethel.' And guess what? The LORD was vibin' with them, totally on their side."
Judges,1,23,"So, the Joseph crew decided to check out Bethel, which used to be called Luz."
Judges,1,24,"So, like, these spies peeped this dude coming out of the city, and they were like, 'Hey, can you, like, show us how to get into the city? In return, we'll hook you up with some mercy.'"
Judges,1,25,"And when he showed them the way inside the city, they attacked the city with their swords, but they spared the man and his whole fam."
Judges,1,26,"So this dude went to Hittite territory, founded a city, and named it Luz. And guess what? That name stuck till now. Pretty cool, huh?"
Judges,1,27,"So Manasseh didn't kick out the people living in places like Bethshean, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, and Megiddo. Instead, the Canaanites decided to stay there."
Judges,1,28,"So, like, when Israel became all powerful, they were like, 'Okay, Canaanites, you gotta pay up,' instead of like completely kicking them out."
Judges,1,29,"Ephraim totally slacked off when it came to kicking out those Canaanites from Gezer. Like, they didn't even bother! So guess what? The Canaanites just chilled in Gezer right alongside them. Yikes."
Judges,1,30,"Zebulun totally didn't kick out the peeps from Kitron or Nahalol. The Canaanites just chilled with them and started paying them tribute, y'know."
Judges,1,31,"Asher didn't fully kick out the peeps in Accho, Zidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob:"
Judges,1,32,"So, like, the Asherites were chilling with the Canaanites, you know, the people who were already living in that place. Instead of kicking them out, they's just coexisting and stuff."
Judges,1,33,"So basically, Naphtali didn't fully kick out the people from Bethshemesh and Bethanath. Instead, he just kinda chilled with the Canaanites who already lived there. But hey, the people from Bethshemesh and Bethanath ended up having to pay tribute to them. #CantBeatEmJoinEm"
Judges,1,34,The Amorites totally blocked the children of Dan from coming down into the valley by pressuring them to stay up in the mountain.
Judges,1,35,"But, like, the Amorites were living in mount Heres in Aijalon and Shaalbim, you know? But the house of Joseph was totally strong and overpowering, so the Amorites ended up becoming their peeps, kinda serving them and stuff. {prevailed: like, was super powerful}"
Judges,1,36,"The Amorites controlled the area from Akrabbim and the rocky terrain, all the way up."
Judges,2,1,"Yo, this angel from the LORD rolled up from Gilgal to Bochim and was like, 'I'm the one who got you outta Egypt and brought you to the land promised to your ancestors. And just FYI, I'm never gonna break my promise to you.'"
Judges,2,2,"And don't make friends with the people in this place, bros and sistas. Destroy their altars like I told you to, but you totally didn't listen to me. Like, why did you go and do that?"
Judges,2,3,"So like, I was totally like, I'm not gonna kick them out in front of you, but they're gonna be super annoying, like thorns in your sides, and their gods are gonna trap you, dude."
Judges,2,4,"Yo, listen up, fam. So, like, this angel from the big man upstairs straight up started talking to all the Israelite homies, right? And when they heard what the angel had to say, the whole crew got mad emotional and started crying. It was a real moment, dude."
Judges,2,5,"So they named that place Bochim, which means 'Weepers,' and they offered sacrifices to the LORD there."
Judges,2,6,"So, like, after Joshua told the people they could go, all the Israelites went to claim their inheritance and take over the land, you know?"
Judges,2,7,"So, like, the peeps were totally down for the LORD throughout Joshua's whole reign and even after when the OG elders were still kickin'. These legends had actually witnessed all the epic stuff the LORD pulled off for Israel. Like, mad respect."
Judges,2,8,"And Joshua, the son of Nun, who served the LORD, passed away at the age of one hundred and ten."
Judges,2,9,"So they laid him to rest in the outskirts of his land in Timnathheres, up in the mountains of Ephraim, on the chill north side of the awesome Gaash hill. {Timnathheres: also known as Timnathserah}"
Judges,2,10,"And then all those old peeps passed away and went to join their ancestors. And a new generation came after them, who were clueless about the LORD and had no idea about the epic stuff He did for Israel."
Judges,2,11,"So, like, the Israelites totally messed up and did some majorly uncool stuff in God's eyes. They started worshiping other gods called Baalim and stuff, not cool at all, man."
Judges,2,12,"But, like, they totally ditched the LORD God of their ancestors, who totally saved them from Egypt, and started worshipping other gods from the people around them. They were all into these other gods and showed them major respect, which made the LORD super angry, like seriously."
Judges,2,13,"And they totally ditched God, and started worshipping Baal and Ashtaroth. SMH."
Judges,2,14,"The LORD was super mad at Israel and let them get wrecked by spoilers who totally messed them up. Then, he sold them out to their enemies from all sides, to the point where they couldn't even put up a fight anymore."
Judges,2,15,"Wherever they went, the LORD made things go bad for them, just like the LORD said and promised. They were really stressed out."
Judges,2,16,"But like, the LORD was all like, 'I got you fam,' and raised up these judges who totally saved them from those who were wrecking them. savedd means, like, saved, you know?)"
Judges,2,17,"But they totally ignored their judges, completely hooked on other gods and worshipped them. They ditched the righteous path their ancestors followed, disobeying the LORD's commandments, and it was not cool."
Judges,2,18,"So, like, when God appointed judges, he totally had their back and saved them from their enemies the whole time they were in charge. It's because God felt really bad for them, you know? They were super bummed out and oppressed, and it really got to God."
Judges,2,19,"So like, after the judge died, they went back to their old ways and like, totally went even further than their ancestors in worshiping other gods and like, doing all the bowing down stuff. They just couldn't stop themselves from doing their own rebellious things and following their stubborn ways."
Judges,2,20,"God was really pissed at Israel, like super mad. He was all like, 'These people totally broke the promise I made with their ancestors, man, and they didn't even bother to listen to me, dude.'"
Judges,2,21,"I ain't gonna kick out anyone from the nations that Joshua didn't fully clear out before he passed away, ya know?"
Judges,2,22,"So I can test out these peeps and see if they'll stick to the Lord's path like their ancestors did, or not. Ya feel?"
Judges,2,23,"So God let those nations stay there, instead of making them leave right away or giving them to Joshua."
Judges,3,1,"So, like, the nations that the LORD left behind were like a test for Israel, you know? It was for those peeps who didn't experience all the wars in Canaan and stuff."
Judges,3,2,"Just so that the young peeps of Israel could gain some wisdom about the art of warfare in case they were clueless about it before, ya know?"
Judges,3,3,"So, like, there were these five Philistine leaders, and also all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who were living up in the mountains of Lebanon, starting from Mount Baalhermon all the way to the entrance of Hamath."
Judges,3,4,"And they wanted to test Israel by using these situations to see if they would actually listen to the LORD's commandments, the same ones that were given to their ancestors through Moses."
Judges,3,5,"So the Israel fam was living their best lives in the midst of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites fam:"
Judges,3,6,"And they, like, totally hooked up with each other's daughters and even got their own daughters married to their sons, all while worshipping those other gods."
Judges,3,7,"So, the Israelites totally messed up and forgot about God. They started worshipping Baalim and hanging out in groves and stuff."
Judges,3,8,"So, like, God got super mad at Israel and let them be taken over by this dude named Chushanrishathaim, who was, like, the king of Mesopotamia. And the people of Israel had to serve Chushanrishathaim for a whole eight years. (BTW, Mesopotamia is also known as Aramnaharaim in Hebrew, just FYI)"
Judges,3,9,"So, like, when the Israelites were like totally desperate and cried out to the LORD, guess what? The LORD hooked them up with a total hero, this dude called Othniel, who was like Caleb's bro and stuff. And Othniel was all about saving the people of Israel from their problems. So cool, right?"
Judges,3,10,"Then the LORD's vibe totally took over him, and he started being the boss, both judging Israel and getting into battles. And guess what? The LORD handed over Chushanrishathaim, the king of Mesopotamia, to him, and he totally crushed Chushanrishathaim. #Victory"
Judges,3,11,"And after forty years, the land finally chilled. Sadly, Othniel, Kenaz's kid, passed away."
Judges,3,12,"So, like, the people of Israel messed up big time once again and God was totally not happy with them. He actually made this King Eglon from Moab super strong and powerful, all because the Israelites were constantly doing bad stuff that really annoyed God."
Judges,3,13,"So, he rounded up the peeps from Ammon and Amalek, and straight up attacked Israel, taking over the city known for its rad palm trees."
Judges,3,14,"So, like, the Israelites were, you know, totally under the rule of Eglon, the king of Moab, for, like, a whole 18 years. Can you even imagine? 🤯"
Judges,3,15,"So, like, when the kids of Israel were in a tough spot and really wanted some help, they called out to the LORD. And you know what? The LORD totally hooked them up! He sent this dude named Ehud, who was from the tribe of Benjamin and happened to be left-handed (kind of cool, right?). The Israelites decided to send a present to Eglon, the king of Moab, through Ehud as their way of saying thanks and showing respect. Oh, and just fyi, Benjamite means he's from Benjamin's fam, and 'lefthanded' means he was, like, naturally a lefty or something."
Judges,3,16,"So, like, Ehud crafted this super cool dagger with two sharp edges, about a cubit long. And get this, he totally tucked it under his clothes, right on his right thigh!"
Judges,3,17,"So he gave the gift to Eglon, the king of Moab, who happened to be pretty chunky."
Judges,3,18,"And once he was done giving the gift, he told the people carrying the gift to leave."
Judges,3,19,"But then he like ditched the guys he was with near Gilgal and was like, yo king I got something super secret to tell you. And the king was like, shh bro, keep it on the DL. So everyone with them totally bounced out of there."
Judges,3,20,"So Ehud went up to him and found him chilling in a private summer hangout spot. Ehud was like, 'Yo, I got a message from God for you.' And the dude stood up from his seat."
Judges,3,21,"And Ehud flexed his left hand, swiped the dagger from his right thigh, and drove it straight into his belly:"
Judges,3,22,"And the handle went in too, after the blade; and the extra flesh closed over the blade, so that he couldn't pull the dagger out of his stomach; and the waste came out."
Judges,3,23,"So Ehud dips out of here, goes through the doorway, slams the doors of the room behind him, and locks them tight."
Judges,3,24,"When he left his room, his friends came in and noticed that the doors were locked. They were like, 'Oh, for sure he's just using the bathroom in his fancy summer spot.'"
Judges,3,25,"So they waited for a long time until they felt embarrassed, and guess what? The person in charge didn't even bother to open the doors for them. So they grabbed a key and unlocked them, only to find out that their boss had dropped dead on the floor."
Judges,3,26,"And Ehud dipped outta there while they were chillin', and managed to peace out past the spot where they be working, and escaped to Seirath."
Judges,3,27,"So, when he arrived, he busted out a sick trumpet solo on the Ephraim mountain, and all the Israelite homies followed him down from the summit, with him leading the crew like a boss."
Judges,3,28,"And he's like, 'Yo, come with me, because the LORD totally handed your enemies, the Moabites, to you on a silver platter.' So they're like, 'Bet!' and they totally go with him and block off the Jordan river to Moab, not letting anyone pass through."
Judges,3,29,"And they totally wrecked Moab, like, big time, taking down around ten thousand ridiculously strong and brave dudes. Like, seriously, not even one guy made it out alive. {lusty: Heb. fat}"
Judges,3,30,So Moab got wrecked by Israel that day. And the land chilled for a solid eighty years.
Judges,3,31,"Then there was Shamgar, Anath's son, who straight-up slayed 600 Philistines using just an ox goad. He totally saved Israel too, like a total boss."
Judges,4,1,"So, like, the Israelites went back to their bad ways once Ehud was gone, and that was a major bummer in God's eyes."
Judges,4,2,"So, like, God was totally like, 'Yeah, you guys messed up big time!' and let this dude called Jabin, who was the king of Canaan, take control. He had this army leader named Sisera who lived in Harosheth, which was, like, a place with non-Israelite peeps."
Judges,4,3,"So, the Israelites were like, 'Yo, God, we need your help ASAP! This dude had, like, 900 iron chariots and totally ruled over us for a whole 20 years!"
Judges,4,4,"Yo, check it out! Deborah, this mega talented chick, was not just any ordinary gal. She was a legit prophetess and happened to be married to Lapidoth. She straight up ruled the land of Israel during that time, making all the big decisions and keeping everyone on track."
Judges,4,5,"So this chick Deborah was living in a super cool spot under a palm tree, like, right in between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim. And get this, the whole crew of Israel would roll up to her for some serious ruling and judgement vibes."
Judges,4,6,"So she hit up Barak, Abinoam's son from Kedeshnaphtali, and was like, 'Yo, didn't the LORD God of Israel tell you to head over to mount Tabor? Take along ten thousand homies from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun.'"
Judges,4,7,"And I'll lure Sisera, the leader of Jabin's army, along with his chariots and his crew, right to the river Kishon. Then, I'll totally hand him over to you, no worries."
Judges,4,8,"So Barak was like, 'Hey, if you come with me, I'm down to go. But if you're not down to go with me, then I ain't gonna go either.'"
Judges,4,9,"And she was like, 'Yeah, I'm totally down to go with you, but just so you know, this journey you're going on isn't gonna bring you any street cred, because the LORD is gonna hand Sisera over to a woman.' So Deborah got up and rolled out with Barak to Kedesh."
Judges,4,10,"So Barak hit up Zebulun and Naphtali, and they all rolled to Kedesh. And he brought along a crew of ten thousand strong, with Deborah right there by his side."
Judges,4,11,"So Heber, a Kenite who was related to Moses by marriage, decided to leave his people and set up his tent near the plain of Zaanaim, close to Kedesh."
Judges,4,12,"So like, they totally informed Sisera that Barak, Abinoam's son, went up to Mount Tabor."
Judges,4,13,"So Sisera gathered all of his wicked cool chariots, like, nine hundred iron chariots and all his homies from Harosheth of the Gentiles all the way to the river of Kishon. Like, they were ready to roll, ya know?"
Judges,4,14,"Deborah was like, yo Barak, get up! Today's the day the Lord has given you victory over Sisera. He's got your back, you know! So Barak went down from mount Tabor with ten thousand homies."
Judges,4,15,"So, like, the LORD totally wrecked Sisera and all his chariots and crew with his sharp sword in front of Barak. Sisera had to bail out of his chariot and straight-up run away on foot, man."
Judges,4,16,"But Barak totally went after the chariots and the whole crew until they reached Harosheth of the Gentiles. And guess what? Sisera's entire army got wrecked by the sword and not a single dude made it out alive. Like, nobody."
Judges,4,17,"But, like, Sisera totally bolted on foot and went straight to Jael's crib. Jael was married to Heber the Kenite, ya know? 'Cause Jabin, the king of Hazor, and Heber's fam were chillin' and had a good thing going on."
Judges,4,18,"So Jael went out to meet Sisera, and she was like, 'Yo, come chill with me, no worries.' And when he came into her tent, she hooked him up with a cozy blanket."
Judges,4,19,"He asked her, 'Can you please give me a sip of water? I'm so thirsty.' So, she opened a bottle of milk and kindly gave him a drink, making sure he was comfortable."
Judges,4,20,"He told her once again, just stand by the tent entrance. When any guy asks about you and wonders if there's a guy here, just tell them nah."
Judges,4,21,"Then Jael, wife of Heber, grabbed a tent peg and a hammer. She approached him quietly, sneaking up while he was fast asleep and worn out. With a single strong strike, she drove the peg into his temples, securing it into the ground. And just like that, he breathed his last."
Judges,4,22,"Yo, check it out! So Barak was chasing after Sisera, right? And then Jael comes out to meet him like, 'Hey, come here, I'll show you the guy you're looking for.' And when he goes into her crib, guess what? Boom! Sisera is lying dead there with a nail stuck in his head."
Judges,4,23,"So, like, God totally defeated Jabin, the king of Canaan, that day in front of the Israelite squad."
Judges,4,24,"The Israelites totally owned Jabin, the king of Canaan. They were super successful and totally dominated him until they completely wiped him out. #Winning"
Judges,5,1,"So, like, Deborah and Barak, Abinoam's son, totally dropped a sick rap on that day, you know? They were like, 'Listen up, everyone!'"
Judges,5,2,"OMG, let's give mad props to the LORD for totally avenging Israel, because the people were like, 'Yo, we're all in' and willingly gave themselves up for real!"
Judges,5,3,"Listen up, kings and princes! I, yes, me, am gonna sing for the LORD. I will sing praises to the LORD, the God of Israel."
Judges,5,4,"Yo, God, when you dipped outta Seir and flexed outta the field of Edom, the whole earth straight shook like crazy, and the skies started pouring rain, fam. Even the clouds were dropping mad water, yo!"
Judges,5,5,"Dude, like, the mountains totally melted when the LORD showed up, bro. And even Mount Sinai, man, it melted too in front of the LORD God of Israel. It was like flowing, you know?"
Judges,5,6,"Back in the day when Shamgar, Anath's kid, and Jael were around, the roads were empty and people had to take the sneaky routes. Travelers had to walk those tricky paths, you know."
Judges,5,7,"The people in the small towns totally stopped living their lives, they were just done in Israel, until your girl Deborah showed up, yes, you heard that right, I became a total boss mom of Israel."
Judges,5,8,"They started simping for new gods, and you know what happened next? Straight up chaos, fam. Like, seriously, did anyone even spot a single shield or spear among the entire forty thousand of Israel? Nah, son, they were too busy with their new idol obsession."
Judges,5,9,"I'm totally stoked about the awesome leaders of Israel who stepped up without hesitation. Praise the LORD, you guys!"
Judges,5,10,"Yo, listen up, you cool peeps riding on fancy rides, you all high and mighty making judgments, and strutting your stuff on the streets."
Judges,5,11,"Those who escaped the sound of arrows while getting water, they'll talk about God doing righteous things in the towns of Israel. Then the people of God will gather at the gates to celebrate righteousness!"
Judges,5,12,"Yo, wake up, Deborah! Get up and drop a sick verse! Rise up, Barak, and conquer your enemies, son of Abinoam."
Judges,5,13,Then he gave the remaining guy the power to rule over the popular ones: the LORD made me have power over the strong.
Judges,5,14,"From Ephraim rose up a leader against Amalek; Benjamin, you were next in line among your people. From Machir came those in authority, and from Zebulun came skillful writers and scribes."
Judges,5,15,"So, like, the top peeps from Issachar were rollin' with Deborah, ya know? It was Issachar and also Barak, but Barak had to go on foot down into the valley. Meanwhile, the Reuben crew were dealin' with some major deep ponderings and contemplations in their hearts. #journeyonfoot #deepthoughts"
Judges,5,16,"Why are you hanging out with the sheep, listening to their noises? The people of Reuben are having some serious internal struggles."
Judges,5,17,"Gilead was chilling on the other side of Jordan, but like, why was Dan still stuck on those ships? Asher just kept it cozy by the seashore, hangin' out in his favorite spots."
Judges,5,18,"Zebulun and Naphtali, brave souls who fearlessly risked it all in the battlefields. They were unafraid of the risks and stood tall, even when others doubted. #Respect"
Judges,5,19,"Yo, the kings came and straight up battled it out, like the kings of Canaan went head to head in Taanach by Megiddo's water; but they ain't even make a single coin from it."
Judges,5,20,"They went all out, flexing from the sky; even the stars showed up, taking on Sisera. {paths: Hebrew for 'strategic moves'}"
Judges,5,21,"Yo, the Kishon river straight up washed them away, that OG river, the Kishon river. O my soul, yo crushed that power."
Judges,5,22,"Like, okay, the horsehoofs totally got messed up because of the intense pransings of their mighty ones. Like, they were trampling and plunging and stuff, it was wild."
Judges,5,23,"Dang, Meroz, the angel of the LORD is not pleased. They're getting cursed big time because they didn't step up to help the LORD against the powerful forces."
Judges,5,24,"Jael, Heber the Kenite's wife, is like, super blessed, okay? She's, like, the most blessed woman ever, especially among all the other ladies in the tent. It's a big deal, for real!"
Judges,5,25,"He was all like, 'Yo, can I get some water?' And she was like, 'Nah, bro, here's some milk.' And then she came through with that fancy butter in, like, a boss-level dish."
Judges,5,26,"She grabbed a nail and a construction worker's hammer and she totally nailed it! With one swing, she took down Sisera by hitting his head and piercing through his temples. Talk about a powerful strike!"
Judges,5,27,"He was totally simping for her, like, he literally worshipped the ground she walked on. He was all like, on his knees, head over heels, just bowing down to her. And then, boom, at that very spot where he bowed, he straight up dropped dead. Like gone, obliterated. It was intense."
Judges,5,28,"Sisera's mom peeped out the window and shouted through the blinds, like, why is his ride taking forever? What's up with the slow wheels on his chariot?"
Judges,5,29,"Her squad of smart homegirls chimed in, yeah, she had her own back and responded to herself. {answer: in other words, her words}"
Judges,5,30,"Did they not flex? Did they not split the loot, giving each guy a couple of chicks? Sisera got a rad, multicolored stash, a sick needlework collection on both sides, totally lit for flaunting those who snagged the booty. Like, seriously dope stuff!"
Judges,5,31,"So like, may all of your haters disappear, Lord; but those who ride or die for you should be as lit as the sun when it's flexing its power. And everything was chill in the land for forty years."
Judges,6,1,"So, the Israelites were totally messing up and not doing right in the eyes of the LORD. And you know what happened? Yep, the LORD let them have it and handed them over to Midian for a whopping seven years."
Judges,6,2,"And the Midianites totally owned Israel: because of them, the Israelites had to start living in those cool mountain hideouts, caves, and strongholds. Felt like the Midianites were pretty strong, ya know?"
Judges,6,3,"So, like, when Israel finally finished planting their crops, the Midianites, the Amalekites, and those kids from the east, they all decided to team up and attack them out of nowhere;"
Judges,6,4,"So they set up camp against them and totally wrecked everything that grew from the earth, all the way to Gaza. They didn't leave any food for Israel, no sheep, no cows, no donkeys. (Or goats)"
Judges,6,5,"So, like, they all rolled in with their livestock and their fancy tents, and there were like a gazillion of them, you know, like a swarm of grasshoppers or something. I mean, seriously, there were so many of them that you couldn't even count their camels. And they straight up invaded the land to wreck it."
Judges,6,6,And Israel was super broke because of those Midianites; and the Israelite peeps cried out to the LORD.
Judges,6,7,"So, like, one time, when the Israelites were, like, totally fed up with those Midianites, they hit up the LORD and were all, 'Help us out, dude!'"
Judges,6,8,"So, the LORD was like, 'Yo, I'm sending a prophet to the kids of Israel.' And this prophet comes through and says, 'Listen up, this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, has to say: I rescued you from Egypt and set you free from slavery.'"
Judges,6,9,"So like, I totally saved you from those Egyptians and all those people who were being mean to you. I kicked them out and gave you their land, you know?"
Judges,6,10,"Yo, I straight up told y'all, I'm the LORD your God. Don't stress over those Amorite gods in the place you're living, like seriously. But let's be real, you haven't exactly been listening to what I'm saying."
Judges,6,11,"So this angel from the LORD showed up and just chilled under an oak tree in Ophrah. It belonged to a dude named Joash, who was from the Abiezrite fam. And meanwhile, Joash's son Gideon was out there doing some wheat threshing near the winepress, low-key trying to hide it from those Midianites. (FYI, Gideon's original name was legit Gedeon.) And he wanted to make it flee, you know what I'm sayin'?"
Judges,6,12,"And then this super awesome angel showed up, and was like, 'Yo dude, God is totally on your side, you're, like, this total legend of bravery.'"
Judges,6,13,"And Gideon was like, dude, seriously, if God is on our side, then why are all these bad things happening to us? And what happened to all those amazing miracles our ancestors used to tell us about, like when God brought us out of Egypt? It feels like God has abandoned us and let the Midianites take over."
Judges,6,14,"Then God saw him and said, 'Yo, go flex your power and you'll be the one to rescue Israel from those Midianites. Like, haven't I sent you for this specific mission?'"
Judges,6,15,"And he was like, yo dude, how am I supposed to save Israel? My fam is mad broke in Manasseh, and I'm like the smallest fish in my dad's crib. Like, for real though, my fam is straight up the least important."
Judges,6,16,"And God was like, 'Don't worry fam, I got you. You're gonna totally destroy the Midianites, like you'll be a one-man army and slay 'em all.'"
Judges,6,17,"And he was like, yo, if I'm chillin' with you, and you think I'm cool, then give me a sign that you're actually talking to me."
Judges,6,18,"Yo, don't bounce just yet. Wait for me to come back with my gift and lay it down for you. And he was like, 'I'll chill until you return.'"
Judges,6,19,"So Gideon went and prepared a young goat and some unleavened cakes made with a whole bunch of flour. He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, and then he brought it all out to him under the oak tree and presented it."
Judges,6,20,"Then the angel of God was like, 'Yo dude, grab the food - the meat and those unleavened cakes. Put 'em on this rock and pour out the broth.' And he was like, 'Bet, I got you fam.' So he did it."
Judges,6,21,"And then the angel of the LORD whipped out the end of his staff and tapped it on the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Suddenly, fire burst out from the rock and devoured the flesh and the unleavened cakes. After that, the angel of the LORD vanished from his view."
Judges,6,22,"And when Gideon realized that it was an angel from the LORD, he was like, 'OMG, Lord GOD! I'm freaking out because I just saw an actual angel in person.'"
Judges,6,23,"And God was like, 'Yo, chill bro! Don't stress, you won't kick the bucket.'"
Judges,6,24,"So Gideon made this sick altar for the LORD, and named it Jehovahshalom: even now, it's still hanging in Ophrah with the Abiezrites. Jehovahshalom means, like, 'The LORD sends peace,' ya know?"
Judges,6,25,"So, like, that night, God was all like, 'Yo, dude, go get your dad's young bull, specifically this second bull that's, like, seven years old, and totally wreck the altar of Baal that your dad has set up, and, like, chop down that grove thing next to it. And, like, don't forget to do it, okay?'"
Judges,6,26,"Yo, make sure you construct a lit altar for the LORD your God on top of this rock, in a dope location fam. Then grab that second bullock and offer it up as a burnt sacrifice using the wood from the grove that you're gonna chop down. (By the way, 'rock' in Hebrew means 'strong place' and 'in the ordered place' could also mean 'in an orderly manner', ya dig?)"
Judges,6,27,So Gideon gathered ten of his crew and followed the LORD's instructions just like he said. The reason he did it in secret at night was because he was afraid of his dad's fam and the homies in town.
Judges,6,28,"So, like, when the dudes in the city woke up super early in the morning, they saw that the altar of Baal got wrecked, and the grove beside it got chopped down. And then they went ahead and sacrificed another bull on the fancy new altar they made."
Judges,6,29,"And they were like, yo, who's responsible for this? So they started asking around and someone was like, bro, it was Gideon, Joash's son, who did this."
Judges,6,30,"So, like, the guys in the city were all like, 'Yo, Joash, bring out your son so we can totally get rid of him!' 'Cause, like, he destroyed that altar of Baal and chopped down the grove next to it."
Judges,6,31,"And Joash was like, y'all really gonna defend Baal? Seriously, tryna save him? Whoever still got his back, they gonna be toast first thing in the morning. If he's really a god, let him defend himself, 'cause someone went ahead and wrecked his altar."
Judges,6,32,"So, like, on that day, he decided to call him Jerubbaal, because he totally tore down Baal's altar. You know, Jerubbaal means 'Let Baal handle this'. Oh, and Jerubbesheth means 'Let the shameful thing handle this', just FYI."
Judges,6,33,"So like, all the Midianites, Amalekites, and like, the kids from the east, they all came together, and like, set up camp in the valley of Jezreel."
Judges,6,34,"But then the LORD's Spirit totally vibes with Gideon, and he busts out a sick trumpet solo. And all the homies from Abiezer roll up to join him. {totally vibes with: like, connects with on a super deep level} {busts out: really shows off} {sick: awesome, amazing} {homies: friends, peeps} {roll up: show up}"
Judges,6,35,"And he texted the squad in Manasseh, and they all pulled up; then he texted the homies in Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they rolled through to link up with him."
Judges,6,36,"And Gideon was like, 'Yo, God, if you're really gonna save Israel through me like you promised,'"
Judges,6,37,"Yo, I'm gonna lay down a fleece of wool on the floor. If the dew only falls on the fleece and not on the rest of the ground, then I'll know for real that You'll save Israel through me, just like You said."
Judges,6,38,"And just like that, he got up mad early the next day and squeezed the fleece real tight, squeezing out all the dew into a bowl. The bowl was filled to the top with water, man."
Judges,6,39,"Gideon was like, Godd, please don't be mad, give me this one chance to show you something. Let's do a little experiment with a piece of wool. If the wool is dry but the ground is covered in dew, then you'll see what I mean.'"
Judges,6,40,"So, like, God totally did this thing that night, ya know? The fleece was all dry and stuff, while the rest of the ground was covered in dew."
Judges,7,1,"So Jerubbaal, AKA Gideon, and all his homies woke up super early and set up camp near the dope well of Harod. The enemy Midianites were chillin' on the north side, by the lit hill of Moreh, in the valley."
Judges,7,2,"God said to Gideon, 'Yo, dude, there are way too many people rollin' with you for me to let them defeat the Midianites. If I did, the Israelites would start flexin' and be like, 'I did this all by myself!'"
Judges,7,3,"So like, listen up, go tell all the peeps, if anyone is like scared or freaking out, they can dip out and peace out from Mount Gilead. And guess what? 22,000 of them actually bounced, leaving only 10,000 left."
Judges,7,4,"So, the LORD told Gideon, 'Dude, there are way too many people here. Take them down to the water and I'll test them for you. Whoever I say can go with you, they can go. And whoever I say shouldn't go with you, they can't go.'"
Judges,7,5,"So like, he gathered all the people by the water, and the LORD was all like, 'Yo Gideon, check it out - anyone who laps the water with their tongue like a dog, separate them out. Also, anyone who gets down on their knees to drink, do the same.'"
Judges,7,6,"And there were like 300 dudes who were like drinking water by, like, putting their hand to their mouth, while everyone else totally kneeled down to drink water."
Judges,7,7,"And God told Gideon, 'I'll save you and hand the Midianites over to you through the 300 dudes who drank water a certain way. Everyone else can just go back to their own turf.'"
Judges,7,8,"So the peeps grabbed their snacks and their trumpets: and he told the rest of Israel to head back to their tents, keeping only those three hundred guys: and the Midianites were chillin' in the valley below."
Judges,7,9,"So, like, that night, God was all like, 'Yo, dude, get up and go down to the enemy camp, 'cause I already made them surrender to you.'"
Judges,7,10,"But hey, if you're too scared to go down, just take your homie Phurah with you to the squad:"
Judges,7,11,"And you gotta listen to what they're sayin'; then you'll get the confidence to join the crew. So, he went with his servant Phurah to the outskirts of the soldiers that were in the crew."
Judges,7,12,"The Midianites, the Amalekites, and all the kids from the east were chilling in the valley, looking like a swarm of grasshoppers. They had camels for days, so many that it was like the sand at the beach."
Judges,7,13,"So, when Gideon arrived, he saw this guy telling his friend about a dream. He was like, 'Yo, listen up, I had this wild dream. I saw a barley bread roll crash into the Midianite camp, knocking over one of their tents and flattening it.'"
Judges,7,14,"And his friend was like, 'Bro, this is straight up Gideon's sword, you know? He's a total badass from Israel and God totally dropped Midian and their whole crew into his hands.'"
Judges,7,15,"So, like, when Gideon heard about the dream and its meaning, he was all in awe and went back to the Israelite camp and was like, 'Yo, get up and get ready, 'cause the LORD has totally delivered the Midianites into our hands.' (Interpretation: Hebrew for 'breaking')"
Judges,7,16,"So he split the squad of three hundred guys into three groups, giving each one a trumpet and empty containers with lamps inside."
Judges,7,17,"And he was like, yo, just peep me and do the same thing, like for real. And check it, when I head out of the camp, you gotta follow my lead and do exactly what I do, no cap."
Judges,7,18,"Yo, when I start blasting on the trumpet, me and all my homies, y'all better start blowing them trumpets too, all over the camp. And make sure y'all shout, 'It's the sword of the LORD and Gideon!'"
Judges,7,19,"So Gideon and his squad of a hundred dudes rolled up to the outskirts of the camp at, like, midnight. The watch had just started, so they didn't waste any time. They whipped out their trumpets and shattered the pitchers they were holding."
Judges,7,20,"Then the three groups took out their trumpets, broke the pitchers, and held the flashlights in their left hands, while they blew their trumpets with their right hands. They shouted, 'It's time for the Lord and Gideon to bring out their swords!'"
Judges,7,21,"And they were all in their own spots around the camp: and everyone started running, screaming, and freaking out."
Judges,7,22,"Then the three hundred people blew the trumpets, and God made each person fight against each other throughout the entire army. The army ran away to Bethshittah in Zererath and to the border of Abelmeholah, all the way to Tabbath."
Judges,7,23,"The dudes from Israel rounded up from Naphtali, Asher, and all Manasseh, and chased after those Midianites."
Judges,7,24,"So Gideon sent messages to everyone in mount Ephraim, like 'Yo, let's crush the Midianites! Meet us at Bethbarah and Jordan to grab the water.' Then all the dudes from Ephraim came through, and they snagged the water at Bethbarah and Jordan."
Judges,7,25,"So they captured two Midianite leaders, Oreb and Zeeb. Oreb was killed on the rock named after him, and Zeeb was slain at the winepress called Zeeb. Then they chased after the rest of the Midianites, and presented Gideon with the heads of Oreb and Zeeb on the other side of the Jordan river."
Judges,8,1,"And the guys from Ephraim were like, bro, why didn't you hit us up before you went to battle the Midianites? They were seriously pissed off at him."
Judges,8,2,"And he was like, yo, what I did? Can't even compare to what you guys did, ya know? The leftovers from Ephraim's grapes are way better than Abiezer's harvest, trust me."
Judges,8,3,"Yo, God totally handed over those Midianite princes, Oreb and Zeeb, to you. And seriously, what could I even do in comparison to you? They totally calmed down and chilled out once you said that."
Judges,8,4,"So, Gideon and his crew of 300 homies made it across the Jordan River. They were tired as heck, but still going strong, chasing after those dudes."
Judges,8,5,"Yo, guys from Succoth, can you hook us up with some bread for the squad? They're mad hungry and I'm chasing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the Midian kings."
Judges,8,6,"So, like, the leaders of Succoth were all, 'Hey, do you even have those Zebah and Zalmunna dudes, like, caught and stuff? 'Cuz if you don't, we're not about to give bread to your whole army, ya know?'"
Judges,8,7,"And Gideon was like, once the LORD helps me defeat Zebah and Zalmunna, I'm gonna totally wreck you by scratching you up with thorny plants from the wild."
Judges,8,8,"And then he went to Penuel, and he spoke to them too. And the guys at Penuel answered him just like the guys at Succoth did."
Judges,8,9,"Then he talked to the dudes from Penuel and was like, 'Yo, when I come back all chill, I'm totally gonna wreck this tower.'"
Judges,8,10,"So Zebah and Zalmunna were chilling in Karkor, with their whole squad of about 15k dudes. They were the only ones left from the massive army of the eastern peeps, because they straight up wiped out 120k sword-wielding warriors."
Judges,8,11,"So Gideon rolled up to the chill spot where the tent-dwelling crew of Nobah and Jogbehah were posted up, and totally wrecked their squad, 'cause they were sleeping on their defenses."
Judges,8,12,"And when Zebah and Zalmunna dipped, he went after them, nabbed the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and totally spooked their entire crew. {discomfited: Hebrew for terrified}"
Judges,8,13,"So Gideon, Joash's son, came back from the battle before sunrise,"
Judges,8,14,"So they grabbed this dude from a town called Succoth, and they asked him to spill the tea. And he spilled all the deets about the big shots and old heads of Succoth – a total of 67 dudes."
Judges,8,15,"So he went up to the guys in Succoth and was like, 'Yo, check it out, Zebah and Zalmunna, the dudes you were all hating on me about, asking if I actually got my hands on them. Now, can you hook up my tired homies with some bread or what?'}"
Judges,8,16,"So he grabbed the OGs from the hood, along with some wild prickly plants, and used them to school the homies in Succoth. {taught: To make them understand}"
Judges,8,17,"And he totally destroyed the tower of Penuel, and wiped out all the dudes in the city."
Judges,8,18,"So he asked Zebah and Zalmunna, what kind of dudes did you kill at Tabor? And they said, just like you, man, they looked like some royal kids, all stylish and stuff."
Judges,8,19,"And he was like, yo, they were my bros, my actual blood, you know? Swear to God, if you had kept them alive, I wouldn't have to take you down."
Judges,8,20,"And he was like, 'Jether, dude, go and like, totally take them out.' But Jether, being all young and stuff, didn't draw his sword 'cause he was kinda scared, you know, being such a young one and all."
Judges,8,21,"So Zebah and Zalmunna were like, 'Come at us, bro!' because they thought Gideon's strength was equal to his appearance. But Gideon didn't back down - he straight up defeated Zebah and Zalmunna, and even swiped the bling off their camels' necks!"
Judges,8,22,"So the guys from Israel were like, 'Gideon, dude, you should totally be in charge of us, and your son, and even your son's son. 'Cause you totally saved us from those Midian people, man."
Judges,8,23,"And Gideon was like, 'Nah fam, I ain't gonna be your ruler, and my future offspring won't either. God's the one in charge, yo.'"
Judges,8,24,"So, Gideon was like, yo my peeps, I got a small favor to ask. Can y'all hook me up with the earrings you snagged from the enemy? (Cause those Ishmaelites were all about that bling bling.)"
Judges,8,25,"And they were like, 'Sure, we'll gladly give {them}.' So they grabbed a hoodie and everyone threw in their cool earrings."
Judges,8,26,"And the gold earrings he asked for weighed a thousand and seven hundred shekels. And that's not even counting the cool accessories, fancy necklaces, and dope purple clothes that the Midianite kings wore. Oh, and let's not forget about the sick chains around their camels' necks. Those guys knew how to rock some serious bling."
Judges,8,27,"So Gideon made this cool ephod thing and put it in his city, Ophrah. All of Israel got super obsessed with it and got totally distracted. But this actually ended up causing big problems for Gideon and his fam."
Judges,8,28,"So, like, Midian totally got owned by the Israelites, and after that, they didn't mess with them again. The whole place was chill for, like, forty years when Gideon was in charge."
Judges,8,29,"So Jerubbaal, Joash's son, moved into his own crib."
Judges,8,30,"Gideon had a total of seventy sons, all born from different moms, because he had multiple wives. (Note: The phrase 'going out of his thigh' refers to biological offspring.)"
Judges,8,31,So this guy had a side chick in Shechem who had his son and he named him Abimelech.
Judges,8,32,"And Gideon, Joash's son, passed away at a ripe old age and was laid to rest in the tomb of his father Joash, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites."
Judges,8,33,"After Gideon died, the Israelites straight up went back to their old ways and started worshipping Baalim, like they were thirsting for attention. They even made Baalberith their ultimate idol."
Judges,8,34,"But the Israel fam totally forgot about the LORD their God, who saved them from all their haters on all sides. Like, come on guys, remember your blessings!"
Judges,8,35,"They didn't even appreciate what Gideon, also known as Jerubbaal, did for Israel. Despite all the incredible things he did, they didn't show him any love or recognition."
Judges,9,1,"So Abimelech, who was the son of Jerubbaal, traveled to Shechem to connect with his extended fam and have a chat with them and his mom's side of the family, and he was like,"
Judges,9,2,"Yo, listen up everyone in Shechem. I got a question for ya: Would you rather have all the 70 sons of Jerubbaal ruling over you or just one? Don't forget, we're family too. Think about it, fam."
Judges,9,3,"His mom's fam started talking about him to everyone in Shechem, saying all this stuff: and it totally won everyone over to Abimelech's side. They were like, 'Yo, he's family. We gotta ride with him.'"
Judges,9,4,"So they gave him 70 silver coins from the house of Baalberith, which Abimelech used to hire a bunch of useless and irresponsible people to follow him."
Judges,9,5,"Then he went to his dad's place in Ophrah and killed all seventy of his bros, Jerubbaal's sons, on a single stone. But the youngest son, Jotham, managed to hide and survive."
Judges,9,6,"So, all the dudes from Shechem and the Millo fam got together and went to make Abimelech the king, at this spot near the pillar in Shechem, where there was an ancient oak tree."
Judges,9,7,"So, like, when they told Jotham what went down, he straight up went and stood on top of mount Gerizim, raised his voice and shouted, saying, 'Listen up, folks of Shechem! If you want God to listen to you, then you better listen to me too!'"
Judges,9,8,"So, like, the trees were like, 'Hey, let's find a boss to rule over us!' And they asked the olive tree to be their king."
Judges,9,9,"But the olive tree was like, 'Wait, you want me to ditch all this richness that brings honor to God and humans, just to become some kind of tree celebrity? Like, really?'"
Judges,9,10,"And the trees were like, 'Hey fig tree, you should totally be our ruler!'"
Judges,9,11,"Yo, the fig tree was like, 'Why should I ditch my sweetness and good fruit just to be the top dog among the trees?'"
Judges,9,12,"The trees were like, 'Hey vine, come join us and be our ruler.'"
Judges,9,13,"And the vine was like, why would I ditch my awesome wine that brings joy to both God and humans, just to be some big shot among the trees?"
Judges,9,14,"Then all the trees said to the bramble, Yo, come and be our ruler."
Judges,9,15,"And the bramble was like, 'Yo, trees! If y'all really want me to be your king, then come chill under my shade and trust me. But if not, watch out 'cause this bramble's gonna spit some fire and burn those fancy cedars of Lebanon.'"
Judges,9,16,"So, like, if y'all have really been genuine and fair by making Abimelech king, and if you've treated Jerubbaal and his fam with respect, doing right by him and everything he deserves, then..."
Judges,9,17,"Yo, my pops really came through for you, went all out and risked his life for you to save you from those Midianites and stuff. Like, he legit put everything on the line for you, no cap. He straight up cast his life out there, ya feel me?"
Judges,9,18,"So, like, y'all totally rebelled against my dad's house today and straight up killed all his sons, like 70 of 'em, all in one go! And then you went ahead and crowned Abimelech, the son of his servant, as king over the dudes in Shechem, just 'cause he's technically your brother, or whatever. Like, seriously? 🙄"
Judges,9,19,"If y'all have been real and legit with Jerubbaal and his crew today, then celebrate Abimelech and let him be stoked about y'all too:"
Judges,9,20,"But if they don't, like, ya know, Abimelech be spitin' fire and totally wreckin' the dudes in Shechem and the crib in Millo; and let the homies in Shechem and Millo spit fire too, and, like, totally destroy Abimelech."
Judges,9,21,"So Jotham dipped outta there, bounced, and jetted straight to Beer, set up camp, all because he was shook of Abimelech, his own bro."
Judges,9,22,"When Abimelech was ruling the land of Israel for three whole years,"
Judges,9,23,"So, like, God sent this really bad vibe between Abimelech and the dudes from Shechem, and the Shechem peeps totally stabbed Abimelech in the back, man:"
Judges,9,24,"So that the punishment for the awful act committed against the seventy sons of Jerubbaal could come, and the blame be placed on Abimelech, their brother, who killed them, as well as on the people of Shechem who supported him in his evil deeds."
Judges,9,25,So these guys from Shechem set up a sneaky trap on top of the mountains and started stealing from anyone who passed by. Someone snitched to Abimelech about it.
Judges,9,26,"Then Gaal, the son of Ebed, showed up with his crew and rolled into Shechem. The people of Shechem were vibin' with him, full of trust and all that."
Judges,9,27,"So they went out to the fields, gathered their vineyards, stomped the grapes, had a great time, went to their favorite hangout, had some food and drinks, and ended up badmouthing Abimelech."
Judges,9,28,"And Gaal, son of Ebed, was like, 'Who is this Abimelech guy? And who cares about Shechem? Why should we even serve him? Isn't he just Jerubbaal's son? And isn't Zebul just his lackey? We should totally serve the dudes from Shechem's father, Hamor. Like, what's the point of serving this Abimelech dude anyway? Why bother?'}"
Judges,9,29,And I wish I could totally take charge of this situation! Then I would totally get rid of Abimelech. And he told Abimelech to assemble a bigger army and face the challenge head on.
Judges,9,30,"And when Zebul, the boss of the city, heard what Gaal, the son of Ebed, said, he got hella mad. {hot: or, fired up}"
Judges,9,31,"So, he secretly messaged Abimelech and was like, 'Yo, Abimelech, check it out. Gaal and his crew just rolled into Shechem, and they're like totally beefing up the city to go against you.'"
Judges,9,32,"So like, get up at night, you and your squad, and like, hide in the field, ready for the hustle:"
Judges,9,33,"So, here's the deal: as soon as the sun peeks out in the morning, you gotta wake up bright and early and make your move on the city. And guess what? When they come out to confront you with their crew, you can handle them however you see fit. It's all up to you and what seems right in the moment, no limitations."
Judges,9,34,"So Abimelech and all his squad, like, snuck around at night and set up ambushes in Shechem with four different groups."
Judges,9,35,"So Gaal, Ebed's son, went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate. Then Abimelech and his crew, who were hiding, got up."
Judges,9,36,"So, like, Gaal sees these people and he's all like, 'Yo Zebul, check it out, people are coming down from the mountains!' And Zebul's like, 'Bro, chill. That's just the shadows of the mountains, looking like people and messing with your head.'"
Judges,9,37,"So Gaal started talking again, like bro, check it out, there are these people coming down through the middle of the land, and there's another group coming along through the plain of Meonenim. (FYI, Meonenim means like, the time-watchers or something)"
Judges,9,38,"Zebul was like, 'Dude, what happened to all that big talk of yours? You were all, 'Who even is this Abimelech guy that we should serve him?' Now look at you, dissing the same people you used to downplay. Time to back it up and prove yourself, bro. So go out there, I dare you, and show 'em what you're made of by fighting them."
Judges,9,39,"So Gaal, like, led the dudes from Shechem and totally fought against Abimelech."
Judges,9,40,"Abimelech totally went after him, and he hightailed it outta there, with tons of casualties and injuries, all the way to the entrance of the gate."
Judges,9,41,"So Abimelech stayed in Arumah and Zebul kicked Gaal and his crew out of Shechem, not letting them stay there."
Judges,9,42,"The next day, everyone headed out to the field and spilled the tea to Abimelech."
Judges,9,43,"So he gathered the peeps and split 'em into three squads, then set up an ambush in the field. He spotted the crowd comin' outta the city and went for 'em, straight up wrecking 'em."
Judges,9,44,"Abimelech and his squad bolted forward and took positions at the entrance of the city gate. Meanwhile, the other two crews sprinted towards everyone chilling in the fields and straight up ended them."
Judges,9,45,"So, Abimelech totally went all out and attacked the city, going at it the whole day. And you know what? He ended up capturing the city, wiping out everyone in it and even destroying the whole place. To top it off, he even spread salt all over the land, making sure nothing would grow there again."
Judges,9,46,"And when all the guys at the tower of Shechem heard about it, they went into a safe spot in the crib of the god Berith."
Judges,9,47,Abimelech heard that everyone at the Shechem tower had gathered up.
Judges,9,48,"So Abimelech went up to mount Zalmon with his crew, and he grabbed an axe and cut down a branch from a tree. He put it on his shoulder and said to the people with him, 'Do what you just saw me do, and do it quickly.'"
Judges,9,49,"And everyone there grabbed a branch and joined Abimelech's crew. They took over the tower, set it on fire, and wiped out everyone inside. There were about a thousand men and women who lost their lives in the tower of Shechem too."
Judges,9,50,"So Abimelech went to Thebez, set up camp there, and successfully captured it."
Judges,9,51,"So there was this epic tower in the city, and all the dudes and ladies, and everyone in the city, hurried over there and locked the entrance. They made their way up to the roof of the tower like champs."
Judges,9,52,"So Abimelech, like, totally approached the tower and started a fierce fight, pushing hard against the door with the savage intention of setting it ablaze."
Judges,9,53,"So basically, this woman went all out and chucked a millstone at Abimelech's head, smashing his skull to pieces."
Judges,9,54,"So he quickly called over his homie, his armor-wearing partner, and said to him, 'Yo, grab your sword and take me out, so people don't go around saying I got taken out by a chick.' And his homie straight up stabbed him, and he died."
Judges,9,55,"So, like, when the guys from Israel saw that Abimelech was totally dead, they all bounced and went back home."
Judges,9,56,"So God made Abimelech face the consequences for the evil he did by killing his seventy brothers, just like he deserved:"
Judges,9,57,"God totally made the Shechem dudes pay for all the messed up stuff they did, and they had to deal with Jotham's curse too!"
Judges,10,1,"And right after Abimelech, there was this dude named Tola, son of Puah, son of Dodo, repping the tribe of Issachar. He set up shop in Shamir, up in the mountains of Ephraim, holding it down for Israel and keeping them safe."
Judges,10,2,"And he was in charge of the Israelites for 23 years, and then he passed away and was laid to rest in Shamir."
Judges,10,3,"Then there was this guy named Jair, from Gilead, and he was like the boss of Israel for twenty-two years."
Judges,10,4,"He had like, thirty sons who rode on thirty dope-looking colts, and they were balling with thirty cities, known as Havothjair till now, in the Gilead region. #VillageGoals 💯"
Judges,10,5,And Jair passed away and got buried in Camon.
Judges,10,6,"So, the Israelites messed up again and totally disobeyed the LORD. They started worshipping all these other gods like Baalim, Ashtaroth, the gods of Syria, the gods of Zidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the children of Ammon, and even the gods of the Philistines! They straight-up abandoned the LORD and stopped serving Him. Smh."
Judges,10,7,"God was really furious with Israel, so he let the Philistines and Ammonites take control over them."
Judges,10,8,"And for a solid eighteen years, they straight up messed with and made life miserable for the children of Israel who were chilling on the other side of the Jordan River in Amorite territory, specifically in Gilead. It was like they totally crushed them and brought them down."
Judges,10,9,"And then the Ammonites crossed the Jordan River to go and battle against the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim. It was a real mess for Israel, they were seriously struggling."
Judges,10,10,"So, the Israelite fam was like, 'OMG, Lord! We messed up big time. We totally ditched You and started serving these other gods called Baalim.'"
Judges,10,11,"So, like, God was talking to the Israelites, and He was all like, 'Dudes, didn't I totally rescue you from the Egyptians, Amorites, Ammonites, and Philistines?'"
Judges,10,12,"The Zidonians, Amalekites, and Maonites were totally oppressing you, but you reached out to me and I totally came to your rescue, freeing you from their grip."
Judges,10,13,"But you've totally ditched me and started simping for other gods, so I'm not gonna come through for you anymore."
Judges,10,14,Hit up your fave gods and straight up ask for their help when things get tough. Let's see if they can pull you out of this mess!
Judges,10,15,"Yo, LORD, we messed up big time. We're totally accepting whatever punishment you think is right for us. Just please, we're begging you, save us from this mess today. #WhateverYouThinkIsBest"
Judges,10,16,"And they ditched all those weird gods they were into, and started serving the LORD. And man, it really broke His heart to see how messed up things were for His people, like, it really hit Him hard."
Judges,10,17,"So, like, the Ammon squad got together and set up camp in Gilead. And the Israel crew, they all gathered up and set up camp in Mizpeh. (BTW, gatheredd' here means they cried out or something)"
Judges,10,18,"So like, the folks and leaders of Gilead were all like, 'Yo, who's gonna step up and take on the Ammonites? Whoever does will totally be the boss of everyone in Gilead!'"
Judges,11,1,"So, like, Jephthah was this super strong dude from Gilead, and his mom was, you know, a harlot. Gilead was his dad, and he's the one who brought Jephthah into the world."
Judges,11,2,"So the wife of Gilead had sons, and her sons grew up and kicked Jephthah out, saying, 'You won't get any of our inheritance, dude, because your mom isn't one of us.'"
Judges,11,3,"So Jephthah bounced from his crew and crashed in the land of Tob. There, he linked up with a bunch of sketchy dudes who rolled with him."
Judges,11,4,"So like, after a while, the Ammonites started a war with Israel."
Judges,11,5,"So basically, the Ammonites thought they could mess with Israel, but guess what? The wise folks of Gilead decided to call upon Jephthah from Tob to handle the situation."
Judges,11,6,"They were like, 'Hey Jephthah, you should totally be our leader so we can take on those Ammonites and show them who's boss.'"
Judges,11,7,"Yo, I gotta ask the Gilead crew: wasn't it you who straight up hated on me and kicked me out of my own crib? So why y'all suddenly showing up at my doorstep when you're in some deep trouble?"
Judges,11,8,"So, like, the older dudes from Gilead were all like, 'Yo Jephthah, we need your help, bro! Come kick some butt with us against those Ammonite peeps, and be our leader over everyone in Gilead!'"
Judges,11,9,"So Jephthah was like, 'Yo, Gilead elders! If you bring me back to whoop the Ammonite kids, and if the big man upstairs helps me win, will y'all make me your leader?"
Judges,11,10,"The older folks from Gilead were like, 'Yo Jephthah, the big guy upstairs gonna be watching over us to see if we do what you say. If not, He gonna hold us accountable, no cap.'"
Judges,11,11,"So Jephthah was like, 'Let's roll, Gilead fam!' And the people were like, 'You're in charge, bro!' And Jephthah made sure to speak his mind to the big man upstairs, in Mizpeh."
Judges,11,12,"So, Jephthah hit up the king of the Ammonites with a DM and was like, 'Yo dude, what's your deal? Why you tryna start a fight in my turf?'"
Judges,11,13,"So, like, the king of the Ammonites, he was all like, 'Yo, Jephthah's messengers, let me tell you why I'm ticked off. Israel totally swiped my turf when they bailed outta Egypt. They basically jacked up everything from Arnon to Jabbok and all the way to the Jordan River. So, here's the deal: give it back, bro, and let's keep the peace.'"
Judges,11,14,So Jephthah hit up the king of the Ammonites again with his squad of messengers:
Judges,11,15,"Jephthah was like, 'Yo, listen up. Israel didn't snatch the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites. No bad vibes here, fam."
Judges,11,16,"But yo, when Israel bounced outta Egypt, and like, hiked through the wilderness to the Red Sea, and finally reached Kadesh;"
Judges,11,17,"So Israel hit up the king of Edom with a DM, like, 'Hey, can I slide through your land real quick?' But the king of Edom was like, 'Nah, not feeling it.' They tried the same thing with the king of Moab, but he wasn't down either. So, Israel had to chill in Kadesh for a bit."
Judges,11,18,"So they like, wandered through the wilderness and stuff, and went around the land of Edom and Moab. They came near the east side of Moab and set up camp on the other side of Arnon, but they didn't actually enter Moab territory because Arnon was like the border and all."
Judges,11,19,"So Israel hit up Sihon, the king of the Amorites, who was ruling in Heshbon. And Israel was like, 'Yo, bro, can we slide through your turf and get to our destination?'"
Judges,11,20,"But Sihon didn't trust Israel to pass through his territory. Instead, Sihon gathered all his crew and set up camp in Jahaz, ready to throw down with Israel."
Judges,11,21,"And then the LORD God of Israel totally handed over Sihon and all his peeps to Israel, and they totally crushed them: so Israel totally took over all the land of the Amorites, the cool dudes who were living there, ya know."
Judges,11,22,"And they totally took over all the territories of the Amorites, from Arnon all the way to Jabbok, and from the deserted areas right up to the Jordan River."
Judges,11,23,"So, like, the LORD God of Israel just totally kicked the Amorites out of the way for His people Israel, and now you're gonna take possession of it or what?"
Judges,11,24,"Like, aren't you gonna claim the stuff that Chemosh, your god, gives you to claim? If the LORD our God kicks anyone out in front of us, we'll totally claim 'em."
Judges,11,25,"And hey, are you seriously thinking you're cooler than Balak, Zippor's son and the Moabite king? Like, did he ever even try to go against Israel or fight them?"
Judges,11,26,"So like, Israel was living in Heshbon and its towns, and also in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities along the coast of Arnon for a long three hundred years. But hey, why didn't you guys get your act together and take back those towns during all that time?"
Judges,11,27,"Dude, listen up. I haven't done anything wrong to you, but it's totally not cool that you're coming at me with this war. May the LORD, the ultimate Judge, make the final call today between the peeps of Israel and Ammon."
Judges,11,28,"But, like, the king of the Ammonites didn't even listen to what Jephthah said when he sent him, y'know."
Judges,11,29,"And then, the Spirit of the LORD was like totally on Jephthah, and he like cruised through Gilead and Manasseh, making his way to Mizpeh of Gilead. And from Mizpeh of Gilead, he went all the way to the children of Ammon."
Judges,11,30,"So, Jephthah made a promise to the LORD and said, like, If You really come through and help me defeat the Ammonites,"
Judges,11,31,"So, like, here's the deal: If anything comes out of my house to greet me when I come back safely from dealing with the children of Ammon, then it's gonna belong to the LORD and I'll totally offer it up as a burnt offering. No joke."
Judges,11,32,So Jephthah went to battle against the people of Ammon; and God helped him win the fight.
Judges,11,33,"And he totally wrecked them from Aroer all the way to Minnith, like, obliterating twenty cities and the vineyard area, with, like, a crazy intense massacre. So, basically, the Ammonites got completely owned by the Israelites. It was epic. #NoMercy"
Judges,11,34,"So Jephthah went back home to Mizpeh, and guess what? His daughter came out to greet him with timbrels and dancing. And get this, she was his only child - he didn't have any other sons or daughters. Like, it was just the two of them, you know?"
Judges,11,35,"And when he saw her, he like totally ripped his clothes and was like, OMG, my daughter! You've like totally brought me down and you're one of those people who stress me out: 'cause I made this big promise to the LORD, and like there's no going back on that now."
Judges,11,36,"And she was like, 'Dad, if you actually made a promise to the LORD, then you gotta stick to it. Do whatever you said you would, because the LORD has already gotten revenge on your enemies, the Ammonites.'"
Judges,11,37,"And she was like, yo dad, let me do this thing: give me some solo time for two months, so I can wander around the mountains and be all sad about not losing my virginity, me and my crew. {wander around...: Or, go and wander on the mountains}"
Judges,11,38,"And he was like, 'Just go, I guess.' So he told her to leave and she bounced for two whole months. She went up to the mountains with her besties and was all like, 'OMG, I can't believe I'm still a virgin! This sucks!'}"
Judges,11,39,"After two months, she went back to her father who fulfilled the promise he made to God. She remained pure and didn't have any relationships. This was a tradition observed in Israel."
Judges,11,40,"Every year, the girls of Israel would gather to honor and remember the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite for four days. They would come together to talk and share their sorrow."
Judges,12,1,"So, like, the guys from Ephraim, they all got together and headed up north. They went up to Jephthah and were like, 'Dude, why did you go and fight against the Ammonites without asking us to come along? If you pulled that move, we'll totally wreck your house with fire.' (And just so you know, gatheredd themselves together' is like, another way of saying 'got together'.)"
Judges,12,2,"So, like, I was all, 'Yo guys, me and my squad were straight up beefing with the Ammonites, ya know? And when I hit you up for backup, you totally ghosted me and bailed. Not cool, dudes."
Judges,12,3,"So, when I peeped that you all didn't come through for me, I took a huge risk and went head-to-head with the Ammonites. And guess what? The big man upstairs, AKA the LORD, totally had my back and helped me defeat them. So tell me, what's the dealio? Why are you all trying to pick a fight with me now?"
Judges,12,4,"So Jephthah brought all the guys from Gilead together and went up against Ephraim. The guys from Gilead totally owned Ephraim because they were dissing them, saying that the Gileadites were just losers hanging out with Ephraim and Manassites."
Judges,12,5,"And the Gileadites totally owned the Jordan crossings before the Ephraimites: and it was like, when those Ephraimites who survived were like, 'Let me pass'; the Gileadite guys were all like, 'Are you, like, totally an Ephraimite? If he said, 'No,';"
Judges,12,6,"Then they were like, yo say 'Shibboleth' and he was like 'Sibboleth' because he couldn't pronounce it right. So they grabbed him and killed him at the Jordan riverside. And at that time, a whopping forty-two thousand Ephraimites bit the dust."
Judges,12,7,"So like, Jephthah was in charge of Israel for, like, six years. But then, you know, he passed away and they buried him in one of those cities in Gilead."
Judges,12,8,Then there was this cool dude named Ibzan from Bethlehem who totally ruled as a judge over Israel.
Judges,12,9,"So this guy had, like, 30 sons and 30 daughters. He decided to let them venture out into the world, meeting new people and stuff. Then, he brought back 30 daughters from different places for his sons to marry. And he ruled over Israel for a solid seven years."
Judges,12,10,"And Ibzan passed away, and he was laid to rest in Bethlehem."
Judges,12,11,"Then there was Elon, from Zebulon, holding it down as judge over Israel for a solid decade. Respect!"
Judges,12,12,"And Elon, who was from Zebulun, passed away and was laid to rest in Aijalon, which is in the land of Zebulun."
Judges,12,13,"Then there was this dude named Abdon, son of Hillel, from Pirathon, who was in charge of keeping the Israelites in check."
Judges,12,14,"He had a total of forty sons and thirty nephews, all riding on a whopping seventy young donkeys. And this cool dude ruled over Israel for a solid eight years. (FYI, nephews here means sons' sons, in case you were wondering.)"
Judges,12,15,"And Abdon, Hillel's son from Pirathon, passed away and was laid to rest in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, on the mount of the Amalekites."
Judges,13,1,"So, the Israelites messed up big time once again and it ticked off the LORD. As a consequence, the LORD allowed the Philistines to totally wreck them for a whopping forty years. Yep, things were definitely not looking great."
Judges,13,2,"So, there was this dude from Zorah, representing the Danites squad. His name was Manoah and his wife couldn't have kids, like she was straight up barren."
Judges,13,3,"So this angel from the LORD showed up to the woman and was like, 'Yo, listen up! Right now, you're not able to have kids and stuff. BUT in the future, you're gonna get pregnant and have a son.'"
Judges,13,4,"Yo, like, listen up! I gotta warn ya, don't be playin' with that wine or strong drink, and stay away from any unclean food, okay?"
Judges,13,5,"Yo, listen up! So, like, you're gonna get pregnant and give birth to a son, right? And here's the deal: no shaving his head, okay? 'Cause this kiddo is gonna be super devoted to God from day one, like a Nazarite! And get this, he's gonna start freeing Israel from the Philistines' control. How awesome is that?"
Judges,13,6,"So this lady went up to her man and was like, 'Babe, listen up. I had this encounter with this total God-sent dude. Lemme tell ya, his vibe was straight up angelic, but also kinda intimidating, ya know? Anyways, he didn't spill where he was from or his name or anything, like mysterious much? Just had to share, fam."
Judges,13,7,"But he's like, 'Yo, listen up! You're gonna get pregnant and have a son, but here's the deal: no alcohol, no party drinks, and no eating anything unclean. This kid is gonna be a cool Nazarite for God from birth till death, no joke.'"
Judges,13,8,"So Manoah was like, yo LORD, please bring back that man of God you sent and show us what we should do when the baby comes."
Judges,13,9,"God listened to what Manoah said, and then the angel of God returned to the woman who was chilling in the field. But her husband, Manoah, wasn't there."
Judges,13,10,"So, the woman was like super pumped and started running to find her husband. She was like, 'Yo, dude! Listen up! The same guy who showed up at our place the other day? Well, guess what? He just showed up again! Can you believe it? Seriously!'"
Judges,13,11,"So Manoah got up and followed his wife to meet the guy and asked him, 'Are you the dude who was talking to my woman?' And he replied, 'Yeah, it's me.'"
Judges,13,12,"Manoah was like, 'Okay, cool, let your words come true. But how are we supposed to raise this kid? What do we do with him?'"
Judges,13,13,"And the angel of the LORD was like, 'Yo, Manoah, listen up. Whatever I told your wife, she better be careful and pay attention.'"
Judges,13,14,"She can't eat anything that comes from grapes, and she can't have wine, or other alcoholic drinks, or eat anything that's considered unclean. She needs to follow all the rules I gave her."
Judges,13,15,"Manoah was like, 'Yo, angel of the LORD, can you hang with us for a bit while we prepare a dope meal for you? Like, a lit roasted kid. Yeah, that's what's up. For real.'"
Judges,13,16,"The angel of the LORD told Manoah, like, even if you try to feed me, I won't eat your food. And if you want to make a burnt offering, make sure you offer it to the LORD. 'Cause Manoah had no idea the angel was from the LORD, you know?"
Judges,13,17,"Manoah was like, 'Hey, angel of the LORD, what's your name? So we can show you some respect when your predictions come true?"
Judges,13,18,"And the angel vibe was like, 'Yo, why you trippin' and all up in my business, tryna know my name? Like, it's lowkey classified info, you know? (or actually, it's like super dope)"
Judges,13,19,"So Manoah brought a goat with a tasty offering and offered it on a rock to the LORD. And the angel did some amazing stuff, while Manoah and his wife watched."
Judges,13,20,"When the fire went up from the altar towards the sky, something amazing happened: the angel of the LORD went up in the fire. Manoah and his wife saw this and couldn't help but drop down to the ground in awe."
Judges,13,21,But the angel of the LORD ghosted Manoah and his wife. That's when Manoah realized that the angel was legit.
Judges,13,22,"Manoah was like, 'Babe, we're totally doomed! We just caught a glimpse of God and that's a big no-no!'"
Judges,13,23,"But his wife was like, 'Yo, if the LORD really wanted to wipe us out, I don't think He would've accepted our burnt offering and meat offering, or shown us all these crazy signs and spills the tea on these current happenings.'"
Judges,13,24,"So like, the woman had a baby boy and named him Samson. And as he grew up, the LORD blessed him, you know."
Judges,13,25,"And the LORD's vibe started hitting him from time to time in the Dan camp, located between Zorah and Eshtaol. {the camp...: Hebrew text: Mahanehdan}"
Judges,14,1,So Samson went to Timnath and spotted this girl from the Philistines while he was there.
Judges,14,2,"So, like, he went to his parents and was all like, 'Guys, you won't believe it! I saw this amazing girl from Timnath, and she's, like, a total catch! Can you, like, arrange for me to marry her?'"
Judges,14,3,"So Samson's parents asked him, 'Why don't you find a wife from our own people or among your relatives? Why do you want to marry a Philistine, who isn't circumcised?' But Samson insisted, 'I really like her, Dad. Get her for me.'"
Judges,14,4,But his parents had no clue that God was orchestrating this whole thing for an epic showdown with the Philistines - they were totally calling the shots at that time in Israel.
Judges,14,5,"So Samson, with his parents, went to Timnath and arrived at the vineyards. Suddenly, this wild young lion comes out of nowhere and starts roaring at him! Like, can you believe it?!"
Judges,14,6,"Then the LORD's Spirit totally took over him, and he tore that dude apart like it was no biggie, with nothing in his hand. But, he kept it on the DL and didn't tell his parents what went down."
Judges,14,7,"So he went over to talk to the lady, and she totally clicked with Samson."
Judges,14,8,"After a while, he came back to claim her, and he took a detour to check out the dead lion's body. And guess what? He found a legit swarm of bees and honey in that lion's carcass."
Judges,14,9,"Then he grabbed some in his hands, kept munching, and headed over to his folks. He handed them some, they chowed down, but he didn't spill the beans that he scooped out the honey from a lion's dead body."
Judges,14,10,"So his dad went to hang out with the woman, and Samson threw a lit party because that's how the homies rolled back then."
Judges,14,11,"And like, when they spotted him, they totally brought along thirty homies to hang with him."
Judges,14,12,"So, like, Samson was all like, 'Hey guys, I have a super cool riddle for you! If you can totally solve it during the whole seven-day feast thingy, I'll hook you up with thirty sheets and thirty sets of clothes, you feel me?'"
Judges,14,13,"But if you can't figure it out, then you'll have to give me thirty cool outfits and thirty fresh kicks. And they said to him, Spill the tea with your riddle, so we can hear it. (outfits: or, shirts)"
Judges,14,14,"And he was like, yo, out of this big creature came some bomb food, and out of this super tough dude came some fire sweetness. But like, for real, those peeps couldn't figure out the riddle for three whole days."
Judges,14,15,"So, on the seventh day, they went up to Samson's wife and said, 'Yo, convince your husband to spill the beans on the riddle, or else we'll totally light you and your fam on fire. Did you invite us here just to jack our stuff? Like, seriously, is it not obvious? Are you planning to rob us or something?'}"
Judges,14,16,"Samson's wife was totally crying and she was like, 'OMG, you just straight up hate me! You gave the homies a riddle but you didn't even tell me about it! Like, seriously?' And Samson was like, 'Hold up! I didn't even tell my own parents about it. Why would I spill the tea to you?'"
Judges,14,17,"And she was like crying in front of him for a whole week, while their party was going on. Then, on the seventh day, he couldn't take it anymore and spilled the beans because she was pressuring him so much. And she went on to share the riddle with her own crew."
Judges,14,18,"And the guys from the city were like, yo dude on the seventh day, right before sunset, they were like, what's sweeter than honey? and what's more power than a lion? And he was like, yo listen up, if y'all didn't mess with my girl, you wouldn't have figured out my riddle."
Judges,14,19,"Then the LORD's spirit totally empowered him, and he went down to Ashkelon and totally slayed thirty dudes, snagged their stuff, and gave cool clothes to those who solved the riddle. He was super ticked off, so he went back to his dad's crib. {stuff: or, clothes}"
Judges,14,20,"But Samson's wife was, like, taken away and given to his buddy, who he had been chillin' with."
Judges,15,1,"So, like, a little bit later during wheat harvest time, Samson went to visit his wife with a young goat. And he was all like, 'Yo, I'm gonna go chill with my wife in the bedroom.' But her dad was like, 'Nah fam, you can't come in.'"
Judges,15,2,"And her dad was like, I honestly thought you totally despised her, so I hooked her up with your homie. But yo, isn't her younger sis way hotter? Can you please just take her instead? Let her be yours, ya know?"
Judges,15,3,"And Samson was like, listen, I may not be perfect, but compared to those Philistines, I'm way more blameless, even if I piss them off. #JustSayin"
Judges,15,4,"So Samson went and caught 300 foxes, then he grabbed some fire gadgets and tied their tails together. And he put a fire gadget in the middle, right between their tails."
Judges,15,5,"And when he lit up the brands, he released them into the Philistines' field, and burned down both the stacks and the crops, including the vineyards and olive trees."
Judges,15,6,"The Philistines were like, 'Yo, who did this?' And the answer was Samson, the dude who married the Timnite girl and then gave her to his bro. So, the Philistines rolled up and straight up burned both her and her father with fire."
Judges,15,7,"And Samson was like, yo, even though you did me dirty, I'm still gonna get payback on you, but then I'm done with this whole situation."
Judges,15,8,And he totally wrecked them with a massive beatdown: then he dipped out and set up camp on the highest peak of rock Etam.
Judges,15,9,"So the Philistines came and set up camp in Judah, spreading out in Lehi."
Judges,15,10,"The dudes from Judah were like, why you tryna mess with us? And they were like, we here to capture Samson, payback for all the stuff he did to us."
Judges,15,11,"So, like, 3000 dudes from Judah mobbed up to the rock Etam and were like, 'Yo, Samson, don't you know we're living under the Philistines' rule? What the heck did you just do to us?' And Samson was all like, 'Bro, they did the same to me, so I just gave it back to them.'"
Judges,15,12,"And they were like, 'Yo, bro, we came here to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines.' And Samson was like, 'Look, swear on your lives that you won't attack me yourselves.'"
Judges,15,13,"They're like, 'Nah, we won't kill you, but we're gonna tie you up real tight and hand you over to 'em.' So, they tied him up with these fresh new cords and carried him up from the rock."
Judges,15,14,"And when he arrived at Lehi, the Philistines started making a lot of noise to try and intimidate him. But then, the Spirit of the LORD came upon him with great power, and the ropes that were tied around his arms became as weak as burnt flax, and his hands were set free from the restraints."
Judges,15,15,"Then he came across a fresh donkey jawbone, so he reached out, grabbed it, and used it to defeat a thousand dudes. By the way, 'new' in Hebrew means 'moist.'"
Judges,15,16,"And Samson was like, check it, I straight up wrecked a thousand dudes using just an ass's jawbone. It was insane, you know, heaps upon heaps, like two big stacks of defeated enemies. That's how I rolled."
Judges,15,17,"So, like, when he finished talking, he totally chucked the jawbone out of his hand and named that spot Ramathlehi. (BTW, that means lifting up the jawbone or, you know, casting it away.)"
Judges,15,18,"And he was really thirsty, so he reached out to the LORD and said, 'You've totally helped me out by giving me this awesome victory! But seriously, am I gonna die of thirst now and end up in the hands of the uncircumcised?'"
Judges,15,19,"So, like, God opened up this hole in the dude's jaw and water came out, and after he drank it, he felt all refreshed and revived. That's why he named the place Enhakkore, which is still called that in Lehi. Enhakkore means, like, the well of the guy who cried out or something. Oh, and by the way, Lehi is the name used in this chapter for the jaw, just FYI."
Judges,15,20,And he ran the show in Israel while the Philistines were running the game for a solid twenty years.
Judges,16,1,So Samson traveled to Gaza and came across a prostitute. He decided to spend some time with her.
Judges,16,2,"So like, word got out to the Gazites that Samson came into town. They totally surrounded him and set up an ambush at the city gate, keeping quiet all night. They were like, 'Yeah, we'll wait till morning and then take him out.' (PSA: 'quiet' here means 'silence')"
Judges,16,3,"So Samson stayed up until midnight, then he got up and took the city gate doors, including the two posts, and carried them away with the metal bar. He put them on his shoulders and brought them up to the top of a hill near Hebron."
Judges,16,4,"So, like, after that, there was this guy who totally fell for this girl in the valley of Sorek, and her name was Delilah. You know, like, by the brook and stuff."
Judges,16,5,"So the big shots from the Philistines went to her and said, 'Get him to fall for you and find out where his unbeatable power comes from, and how we can overcome him, so we can tie him up and make him suffer. And if you help us, we'll each give you 1100 silver coins.'"
Judges,16,6,"So, like, Delilah was all like, 'Hey Samson, spill the tea, dude! Where's the secret source of your power, and what can we use to tie you up and bring you down?'"
Judges,16,7,"And Samson was like, yo girl, if they tie me up with some fresh green cords that have never been dried, I'm gonna lose my strength and be as weak as an average dude. #NotFeelingIt"
Judges,16,8,So the Philistine bosses grabbed seven fresh green ropes and used them to tie him up. (These ropes were not dry yet.)
Judges,16,9,"So, like, there were these dudes hiding in her room, you know? And she was like, 'Yo, Samson, the Philistines are totally trying to get you!' And then he just snapped those ropes, like how a thin piece of cloth breaks when it touches fire. And nobody knew about his insane strength, man. (By the way, 'toucheth' means 'smelleth' in Hebrew, just FYI)"
Judges,16,10,"So, like, Delilah was all like, 'Dude, you totally made fun of me and lied to me. Now spill, I beg you, how can I tie you up?'"
Judges,16,11,"And he was like, 'Yo, if they tie me up real tight with brand new ropes that no one has ever used before, then I'll lose my strength and be as weak as any other dude. Like, those ropes better not have been used for any work or anything.'"
Judges,16,12,"So Delilah grabbed some fresh ropes and tied him up with them. She whispered, 'Hey Samson, the Philistines are coming for you.' Meanwhile, sneaky folks were hiding in the room, ready to ambush. But Samson ripped the ropes off his arms as easily as tearing a flimsy thread."
Judges,16,13,"Delilah was like, 'Samson, you've been playing with me and lying to me. Tell me how to tie you up.' And Samson was all, 'If you braid the seven locks of my hair with a web-like rope.'"
Judges,16,14,"Then she secured it with the pin and said to him, 'The Philistines are coming, Samson!' And he woke up from his sleep and escaped with the pin and the piece of fabric."
Judges,16,15,"She was like, 'Seriously, how can you say you love me when you're not even committed? You've played me three times and still haven't spilled the beans on where your strength comes from.'"
Judges,16,16,"And this happened, when she kept nagging him every day with her words, and pressuring him so much that he felt incredibly stressed out to the point of feeling like he couldn't take it anymore; so stressed that it felt like his life was being cut short."
Judges,16,17,"So, like, he opened up to her completely and was all like, 'Yo, I've never used a razor on my head, bro! I've been devoted to God as a Nazarite since I was born, you know? If I shave my head, my strength will be gone and I'll become weak, just an ordinary dude.'"
Judges,16,18,"And when Delilah peeped that he spilled all his deep secrets, she hit up the Philistine bosses like, 'Yo, come through this one time, 'cause he straight up spilled all his secrets to me.' So the Philistine bosses rolled up to her, holding that cash in their hands."
Judges,16,19,"And she made him crash on her legs, and she called a dude to give him a fresh buzz cut, taking off all seven locks of his epic hairdo. Then she straight up started messing with him, and he lost all of his strength."
Judges,16,20,"Yo, she straight up said, 'Yo Samson, the Philistines are coming for you!' And Samson woke up from his beauty sleep like, 'No worries fam, I got this. I'll do my usual routine and flex real hard.' Little did he know, he had no idea that the Lord had actually left him."
Judges,16,21,"The Philistines snagged him, blinded him, and dragged him to Gaza, where they shackled him with brass chains. He was stuck grinding in the slammer."
Judges,16,22,"But, like, his hair totally started growing again after it got shaved. You know, right after that happened."
Judges,16,23,"So, like, all the big shots of the Philistines got together to, you know, throw this huge party to honor their boss god, Dagon. They were all stoked because they were like, 'Dude, our god totally handed Samson, our archenemy, over to us!'"
Judges,16,24,"When the people caught sight of him, they totally hyped up their deity, 'cause they were like, 'Yo, our god totally came through! He handed over our enemy, the one who wrecked our land and took out so many of us. Like, seriously, our deaths were multiplying!'"
Judges,16,25,"And like, when they were feeling all hyped and stuff, they were like, 'Yo, let's call Samson to entertain us!' So they legit called Samson out of the prison, and he started entertaining them, you know. And they like placed him between the pillars. (BTW, 'them' here means like right in front of them, just clarifying for ya)"
Judges,16,26,"Samson was like, 'Yo dude, let me check out those pillars that keep this place standing. I wanna chillax and lean on 'em.'"
Judges,16,27,"So, like, the whole house was packed with guys and girls, and, dude, all the Philistine big shots were there, you know? And on the rooftop, there were about three thousand dudes and dudettes, just chilling and watching Samson do his thing, man."
Judges,16,28,"Then Samson reached out to the LORD and said, 'Yo, Lord GOD, hook me up with some strength just this one time, O God. I need to get back at those Philistines for taking my eyes.'"
Judges,16,29,"So, Samson grabbed onto the two pillars in the middle of the house, the ones that were holding it up. He took hold of one with his right hand and the other with his left. (By the way, he was leaning on them.)"
Judges,16,30,"Samson's like, yo, let me go out with a bang! He put all his strength into it and the whole house came crashing down on the rulers and everyone inside. Turns out, he actually took out more people in his final act than he did during his whole life. Talk about intense!"
Judges,16,31,"So, like, his bros and fam all came, ya know, and they took him and gave him a proper send-off, burying him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the place where Manoah, his dad, was laid to rest. And get this, he ruled over Israel for a solid 20 years, no cap!"
Judges,17,1,"So, there was this dude from mount Ephraim, and his name was Micah. Like, legit!"
Judges,17,2,"So, like, he told his mom, 'Yo, remember that 1,100 silver shekels that got swiped from you? The ones you got all mad about and talked to me about? Well, guess what, I got 'em. I took 'em.' And his mom was like, 'Wow, thanks to the Lord, you're totally blessed, my son.'"
Judges,17,3,"So, like, once he gave back the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mom, she was like, 'OMG, I totally set aside that silver for the Lord, to like, make a statue or something. So, here, I'm giving it back to you.'"
Judges,17,4,"But he gave the money back to his mom, and she took two hundred silver coins and gave them to the craftsman. The craftsman then used them to make a carved statue and a metal statue, which ended up in Micah's house."
Judges,17,5,So there was this dude named Micah who had a wicked cool crib filled with idols and stuff. He even made his own fancy robe called an ephod and these little statues called teraphim. He even appointed one of his sons to be his chief priest. #familybusiness
Judges,17,6,"Back in the day, there was no big boss ruling over Israel, so everyone just did whatever they believed was right for themselves."
Judges,17,7,"There was this dude from Bethlehemjudah, part of the fam of Judah, who was a total Levite and crashed there for a while."
Judges,17,8,"And the guy left the city of Bethlehem in Judah to stay wherever he could crash, and he ended up heading to Mount Ephraim to Micah's crib along the way."
Judges,17,9,"And Micah was like, 'Yo, where you comin' from?' And the dude was like, 'I'm a Levite from Bethlehemjudah, and I'm just wanderin' around lookin' for a place to crash.'"
Judges,17,10,"And Micah was like, yo dude, come chill with me and be like a dad and a priest to me. I'll hook you up with ten silver coins every year, a dope outfit, and all your meals covered. So the Levite was down and went with him. Micah even got him a whole new wardrobe, like a fresh 'fit."
Judges,17,11,"And the Levite was like, totally cool with staying with the dude; and the young man was like, his homie and stuff, just like one of his own sons."
Judges,17,12,"So Micah made the Levite legit, and the young dude became his priest, chillin' in Micah's crib."
Judges,17,13,"Micah was like, 'Yo, now I know for real that the LORD is gonna bless me, 'cause I got a Levite as my priest!"
Judges,18,1,"Back in the day, Israel had no king. The Danites were on a quest to find their own land to settle in, because up until that time, they hadn't received any inheritance among the other tribes of Israel."
Judges,18,2,"So the Danites, who were pretty brave, chose five guys from their crew who lived in Zorah and Eshtaol. They gave them the mission to check out the land and explore it. They were like, 'Go ahead, scope out the scene.' When these five dudes arrived at Mount Ephraim, they crashed at Micah's crib for the night."
Judges,18,3,"So, like, when they were near Micah's crib, they recognized the voice of the young Levite dude. They rolled up and asked him, 'Yo, who brought you here? What's your deal in this spot? And what's up with all your stuff?'"
Judges,18,4,"And he was like, yo, Micah is treating me like this, he straight up hired me to be his priest."
Judges,18,5,"And they were like, 'Hey, dude, you should totally seek advice from God, you know, just to find out if our plans will be a success or not.'"
Judges,18,6,"And the priest was like, 'You guys chill and peace out: because God's got your back and will guide you on your journey.'"
Judges,18,7,"So the five guys went to Laish and saw the people there living carefree, just like the Zidonians. They were chill and felt safe, without any authority figures to keep them in check. They were far from the Zidonians and didn't have any dealings with anyone. (Laish was also known as Leshem btw and when I say authority figures, I mean those who could put them to shame or tell them what to do)"
Judges,18,8,"So they arrived at Zorah and Eshtaol to meet up with their friends. And their friends asked them, 'Yo, what's up? What's the scoop?'}"
Judges,18,9,"So they were like, 'Yo, let's go up against them because we checked out the land and it's legit amazing. And seriously, are you still just chilling? Don't be lazy, get up and go take control of the land.'"
Judges,18,10,"When you go, you'll be heading to a chill place with a ton of space—God totally handed it to you! It's a spot where you won't be lacking anything the earth has to offer."
Judges,18,11,"So, like, six hundred totally badass dudes from the Danite fam, straight up bounced from Zorah and Eshtaol. And let me tell you, they were armed and ready for some serious combat. Talk about ready to slay!"
Judges,18,12,"So they rolled up and settled in Kirjathjearim, in Judah, so they named that spot Mahanehdan up until now. Look, it's just behind Kirjathjearim."
Judges,18,13,"And they went to mount Ephraim, and arrived at Micah's crib."
Judges,18,14,"So, like, those five dudes who scoped out the land of Laish, they spill the tea to their homies and they're like, 'Yo, did you know that these houses have, like, this ephod thingy, and some teraphim, and, hold up, even a carved and melted statue? Like, seriously, think about what we gotta do now.'"
Judges,18,15,"So they went there and arrived at the crib of this cool Levite guy, like, right at Micah's place, and they said what's up to him. Like, they asked if everything was chill, you know, peace and all that."
Judges,18,16,"So, like, there were these six hundred dudes from the tribe of Dan who were totally armed and ready for battle, and they were hanging out at the entrance of the gate."
Judges,18,17,"So, like, these five dudes went to check out the land, right? They went up, and then they went in there, and they straight up took this carved statue thing, this fancy robe thing, and these weird idol things. Oh, and meanwhile, the priest was just chilling by the entrance of the gate with these six hundred dudes who were armed for battle."
Judges,18,18,"So these guys went into Micah's crib and grabbed the statue, the merch, and the decorative figures, and the metal statue. Then the priest was like, 'What's your dealio?'"
Judges,18,19,"And they were like, dude, just chill, keep quiet and listen. Come with us and be like a rad combination of a father and a priest. Would you rather be a priest for just one guy, or be a priest for a whole tribe and family in Israel?"
Judges,18,20,"The priest was stoked and grabbed the dope accessories like the ephod, teraphim, and graven image, then went chillin' with the homies."
Judges,18,21,"And then, they bounced outta there, making sure to put the young ones, the animals, and the fancy ride up front."
Judges,18,22,"And when they were pretty far from Micah's crib, the guys that were chilling near Micah's crib came together and caught up with the Dan squad."
Judges,18,23,"So the people of Dan were like, 'Hey Micah, what's up with all these people you've gathered?' They called out to him, wondering why he brought such a big crew with him."
Judges,18,24,"And he was like, bro, you totally snatched my gods and the priest, and just dipped. And now you're asking me, what's wrong? Like, seriously, what's your deal?"
Judges,18,25,"Yo, Dan's crew was like, 'Bruh, keep it low-key, don't be all loud around us. 'Cause if some angry peeps catch wind of you, you and your fam might end up losing your lives. Straight up, angry folks be bitter in their souls, ya know.'"
Judges,18,26,"So, like the squad of Dan peaced out and when Micah realized he couldn't handle their power moves, he just bounced and went back home."
Judges,18,27,"So, like, they totally snagged all the cool stuff that Micah made, including the priest he had, and went to this chill town called Laish where the people were just minding their own business and feeling safe. And, yeah, they straight up attacked them with swords and set the whole city on fire."
Judges,18,28,"And like, there wasn't anyone to save them, 'cause it was like so far away from Zidon, and they had no connection with anyone, you know? And it was in this valley near Bethrehob. So they decided to build a city and settle there, ya feel?"
Judges,18,29,"So, they were like, 'Let's name the city Dan, 'cause that's their dad's name and he's, like, part of Israel. But, just so you know, the city's original name was Laish."
Judges,18,30,"So, the Danites decided to put up a fancy statue while Jonathan, son of Gershom, grandson of Manasseh, and his kids, became the super cool priests for the Dan tribe until the land got captured."
Judges,18,31,"And they put up Micah's carved statue, which he made, while the house of God was in Shiloh."
Judges,19,1,"So back in the day, when there was no king in Israel, there was this Levite dude chillin' on the side of Mount Ephraim. He got himself a side chick from Bethlehemjudah, if you catch my drift."
Judges,19,2,"And his side chick completely betrayed him, and bounced from him to her old man's crib in Bethlehemjudah, and stayed there for a solid four months. {four whole months: or, a year and four months: Heb. days, four months}"
Judges,19,3,"And her husband got up and went after her, to talk nicely to her and bring her back, with his servant and a couple of donkeys. She brought him to her father's house and when the girl's father saw him, he was really happy to see him."
Judges,19,4,"And the girl's dad, his father-in-law, let him stay; and he hung out with him for three days: so they grubbed and chilled, and crashed there."
Judges,19,5,"So, on the fourth day, as soon as they woke up in the morning, he got up to leave. Then the girl's father told his soon-to-be son-in-law, like, grab a piece of bread to boost your spirits before you head out."
Judges,19,6,"And they were just chilling, eating and drinking together, because the girl's dad was like, yo, dude, stay the night and have a good time, don't stress."
Judges,19,7,"And like, when the guy was about to bounce, his father-in-law was all like, 'Nah man, you should crash here again.'"
Judges,19,8,"So, like, on the fifth day, he woke up super early to leave, and the girl's dad was all like, 'Chill out, dude. Relax.' And they hung out until the afternoon and had some grub together. Oh yeah, they stayed there until the sun started going down. Cool, right?"
Judges,19,9,"And when the guy was about to leave, he, his side chick, his servant, his father-in-law (the girl's dad) said to him, 'Hey, it's getting late in the day, why don't you stay the night? It's almost bedtime, so crash here and have a good time. Then, tomorrow morning, hit the road and head back to your crib.'"
Judges,19,10,"But the guy didn't stay the night, instead he got up and left. He went towards Jebus, which is Jerusalem. He had two saddled donkeys with him, and his concubine was with him too."
Judges,19,11,"So, like, when they were near Jebus, it was getting late in the day, and the servant was all like, 'Hey boss, let's go chill in this city of the Jebusites and crash for the night.'"
Judges,19,12,"And the boss was like, 'Nah fam, we ain't gonna detour into some random city that's not even ours. Let's just head straight to Gibeah, you know?'}"
Judges,19,13,"So he's like, 'Yo, servant! Let's go find a place to crash for the night, whether it's in Gibeah or Ramah.'"
Judges,19,14,"And they like, moved on and like, went on their way; and the sun, like, went down on them when they were near Gibeah, which is part of Benjamin's turf."
Judges,19,15,"So, they went there to crash in Gibeah, but when they arrived, they couldn't find a place to crash. Nobody offered them a spot in their crib."
Judges,19,16,"So, check it out, there was this old man who finished his work in the field and came back in the evening. He was from Mount Ephraim and decided to stay in Gibeah. But just FYI, the people living there were all Benjamites."
Judges,19,17,"So, like, this dude looked up and saw this random person wandering in the street of the city, ya know? And the old man was like, 'Where ya headed, bro? And where ya coming from?'"
Judges,19,18,"And he was like, yo, we're just traveling from Bethlehemjudah towards the side of mount Ephraim, like I'm heading there. So I went to Bethlehemjudah, but now I'm going to the house of the LORD, you know? And like, there's no one who's willing to host me, you feel me?"
Judges,19,19,"We've got straw and food for our donkeys, and there's also bread and wine for me, you, and the guy hangin' with your crew. We've got everything we need, no shortages here."
Judges,19,20,"And the boomer dude was like, Yo, chillax, may peace be with you. If you need anything, just hit me up, man. Just don't crash in the street, that ain't cool."
Judges,19,21,"Then he took him to his crib, and hooked them up with some grub for the donkeys: and they freshened up, chowed down, and quenched their thirst."
Judges,19,22,"So, like, while they were having a good time and all, these shady dudes from the town came and surrounded the house. They were totally up to no good, banging on the door and telling the owner, this older guy, to hand over the dude who entered his house, so they could, like, mess with him or something."
Judges,19,23,"And the dude, the boss of the crib, stepped out and said to them, 'Nah, my bros, seriously, don't do this evil stuff; this guy came into my house, so let's not do something stupid like this.'"
Judges,19,24,"Yo, check out my daughter and his concubine here. I'ma bring them out and y'all can do whatever you want with them, but don't do anything messed up to this man. That's just too far, man."
Judges,19,25,"But the guys didn't listen to him, so the dude took his side chick and brought her out to them. They did some messed up stuff to her all night until morning. And when daylight started to break, they let her go."
Judges,19,26,"Early in the morning, the woman arrived and collapsed at the man's doorstep, waiting until it got daylight."
Judges,19,27,"The guy woke up in the morning, opened the doors, and went outside like usual. And guess what? His side chick was passed out at the doorstep with her hands touching the ground."
Judges,19,28,"And he was like, 'Yo, let's bounce.' But nobody said anything back. So this dude picked her up and put her on a donkey, and they headed to where he lived."
Judges,19,29,"And when he got home, he grabbed a knife and took hold of his side chick, and cut her into twelve pieces, along with her bones, and sent a piece to each part of Israel."
Judges,19,30,"And it was like, everyone who saw it was like, OMG, there has never been such an epic thing that went down since the day the children of Israel left Egypt and like, till now. So, like, think about it, take some advice, and speak your minds, yo."
Judges,20,1,"Then all the Israelite squad rolled out, and the crew got together like one tight fam, from Dan to Beersheba, repping the Gilead territory, all the way to the LORD in Mizpeh."
Judges,20,2,"And the big boss of all the cool peeps, like from every crew in Israel, came together in this epic gathering of God's squad. There were like four hundred thousand soldiers ready to throw down with their swords."
Judges,20,3,"(So, like, the Benjaminites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpeh.) And the Israelites were all like, 'Yo, spill the tea! Like, what's the deal with this wickedness?'}"
Judges,20,4,"The guy, who was married to the woman that got killed, replied and said, 'I went to Gibeah, which is a place in Benjamin, with my side chick, to stay for the night. Just so you know, I'm a Levite.'"
Judges,20,5,"So, like, the dudes from Gibeah totally came at me, surrounded my house in the dead of night, like they wanted to straight up murder me. And they straight up violated my concubine, she's dead now. It was messed up, man."
Judges,20,6,"So, like, I totally took my concubine and split her into pieces, and sent those pieces all over the place in the land of Israel, ya know? 'Cause they were all doing some real nasty and stupid stuff over there, man."
Judges,20,7,"Listen up, fam! We're all part of the Israel squad. Drop your thoughts and opinions right here. Let's share some knowledge and wisdom."
Judges,20,8,"And all the people stood up together, like, 'No way we're going to anyone's crib, or like, chill in their pad.'"
Judges,20,9,"Yo, here's the plan for dealing with Gibeah: we'll roll the dice and take it on, no hesitation."
Judges,20,10,"So we'll gather ten guys from every hundred in the tribes of Israel, and a hundred from every thousand, and a thousand out of every ten thousand, to go grab some food for the people. They're gonna do something crazy in Gibeah of Benjamin to make up for all the dumb stuff they've done in Israel."
Judges,20,11,"Like, all the dudes in Israel came together and formed this tight squad against the city. They were totally united and connected, just like one group. #squadgoals 🙌"
Judges,20,12,"So, like, the tribes of Israel were totally sending their peeps to check out what was happening in the tribe of Benjamin, and they were like, 'Dude, what's up with all this wickedness going on here? It's totally not cool!'"
Judges,20,13,"Yo, like, pass those dudes, the wicked ones from Gibeah, to us so we can totally get rid of them and remove all the bad vibes from Israel. But the peeps from Benjamin didn't wanna listen to their homies, the Israelites:"
Judges,20,14,"But like, the squad of Benjamin got their act together and rolled out of their hometowns to Gibeah, ready to go head-to-head with the Israel crew in battle."
Judges,20,15,"So, like, at that time, there were about 26k sword-wielding dudes from the cities in Benjamin's crew, ya know? And that's not even counting the 700 badass chosen guys from Gibeah."
Judges,20,16,"So, like, out of all these people, there were like seven hundred mega talented dudes who were left-handed. And get this, they were like expert slingers, capable of launching stones with incredible precision, not even missing by a hair's breadth. Like, so impressive, right?"
Judges,20,17,"And the guys from Israel, except Benjamin, were like 400K sword-wielding dudes: all of 'em were warriors."
Judges,20,18,"So the Israelite squad got all pumped up and headed to God's crib. They were seeking some divine advice and asked, 'Yo, who's gonna be the leader for our epic battle face-off against the Benjamin crew?' God himself responded, 'It's gonna be Judah leading the charge, fam.'"
Judges,20,19,"So, like, the Israelites woke up bright and early, ready to take on Gibeah with their camping skills."
Judges,20,20,"So, like, the dudes from Israel totally rolled out to battle against Benjamin. And they were all like, ready and positioned at Gibeah, all geared up for a fight."
Judges,20,21,"So, like, the guys from Benjamin left Gibeah and totally wiped out, like, twenty-two thousand dudes from Israel that day. It was pretty intense."
Judges,20,22,"And the dudes of Israel pumped themselves up and got ready for round two, positioning themselves in the same spot as they did on day one."
Judges,20,23,"So, like, the people of Israel were all sad and stuff, and they cried to the LORD until it got dark. They were like, yo, LORD, should we fight the people of Benjamin, who are our own bros? And the LORD was all like, yeah, go and fight against them, man."
Judges,20,24,So the Israelites and the Benjaminites faced off again on the second day.
Judges,20,25,So Benjamin came out of Gibeah the next day and totally wrecked another 18K dudes from the Israelites. They all came ready with their swords and stuff.
Judges,20,26,"So all the Israelite squad, and basically everyone, went up and rolled into the house of God. They were crying and just chilling there in front of the LORD. They decided to go on a fast the whole day till evening, and hooked up some burnt offerings and peace offerings to offer before the LORD."
Judges,20,27,"So, the Israelites were like, 'yo, LORD, we gotta ask you something— the ark of the covenant of God, it's chillin' over there, right?"
Judges,20,28,"So Phinehas, the son of Eleazar and Aaron, stepped forward and questioned, 'Should I go into battle once more against the children of Benjamin, my own kin? Or should I quit fighting?' And the LORD replied, 'Go ahead, tomorrow I will ensure your victory.'"
Judges,20,29,And Israel strategically positioned people to ambush around Gibeah.
Judges,20,30,"So the Israelites, like, totally confronted the Benjaminites on the third day and got ready to fight in Gibeah, just like they do every other time."
Judges,20,31,"So the squad from Benjamin flexed on their enemies and dipped out of the city. They straight up started attacking and taking down peeps on the regular like they always do, on the roads that lead to the house of God and to Gibeah in the field. They took out about thirty dudes from Israel. No cap, these battles were getting intense!"
Judges,20,32,"So, like, the Benjamin kids were all like, 'We totally crushed them, just like we did before!' But the Israelite squad was like, 'Nah fam, let's dip and lead them away from the city to the main roads.'"
Judges,20,33,"So, all the guys in Israel were like, Timee to step up!' They gathered themselves at Baaltamar, while the sneaky dudes of Israel sneaked out of their hiding spots, you know, chilling in the fields of Gibeah."
Judges,20,34,"So, like, this big army of ten thousand carefully chosen dudes from all over Israel attacked Gibeah. The battle was, like, intense and stuff, but little did they know that trouble was creepin' up on 'em."
Judges,20,35,And God totally wrecked Benjamin in front of all Israel: The Israelite kids straight up annihilated 25k+ Benjamin dudes with their swords in a single day. It was intense.
Judges,20,36,"Then the Benjamites realized they were being attacked, because the Israelite guys backed off and relied on their sneaky ambush near Gibeah."
Judges,20,37,And the sneaky group moved quickly and suddenly attacked Gibeah; they moved tactically and struck the entire city with their swords. They made a signal with the trumpet.
Judges,20,38,"So basically, here's the deal: there was this secret signal planned between the dudes from Israel and the sneaky dudes hiding out, and the plan was to create this massive smoke-filled flame that would shoot up from the city. It was like their special way of communicating."
Judges,20,39,"And when the guys from Israel backed off during the fight, Benjamin started attacking and killing around thirty guys from Israel. They thought they had us beat, just like in the first battle. 🤨"
Judges,20,40,"But yo, when the fire started blazing outta the city with a massive cloud of smoke, the Benjamites turned around and peeped that the whole place was straight up on fire, blazing all the way up to the sky. {the whole consumption of: meaning the whole darn thing was burnin'}"
Judges,20,41,"And when the guys from Israel turned around, the dudes from Benjamin were shooketh because they realized bad stuff was happening to them. #majorbummer"
Judges,20,42,"So they ran away from the men of Israel and went into the desert. But the fight caught up to them, and they destroyed everyone who came out of the cities right in the middle of them."
Judges,20,43,"So, they totally surrounded the Benjamites and went after them, trampling them down without breaking a sweat near Gibeah, heading east. It was a total victory!"
Judges,20,44,"And like, so basically, there were like 18,000 awesome Benjamin dudes who got totally defeated in battle. They were all super brave and stuff."
Judges,20,45,"And they quickly ran towards the wilderness to the epic hangout spot of Rimmon. They totally nabbed about five thousand dudes on the road and chased them down nonstop to Gidom, straight up taking out two thousand dudes from their crew."
Judges,20,46,"On that day, a total of 25K dudes from Benjamin got wrecked in battle. And let me tell you, these guys were no joke, they were absolute badasses."
Judges,20,47,"But like, six hundred dudes straight up bolted to the wilderness, man, and camped out at this place called Rimmon for four whole months, bro."
Judges,20,48,"So the Israelite guys went back and attacked the guys from the tribe of Benjamin. They totally wrecked them with their swords, not only the guys in every city, but also the animals and anything they could get their hands on. And if that wasn't enough, they even set all the cities they came across on fire. (Just so you know, 'came to hand' means they found them, and 'they came' means they were found.)"
Judges,21,1,"So, like, the dudes in Israel made this serious oath in Mizpeh. They were like, 'No way, bro! None of us are gonna let our daughters marry dudes from Benjamin.'"
Judges,21,2,"So, like, the peeps went to God's crib, and stayed there all day, straight up chilling with God. They started shouting and crying so hard, man, it was intense."
Judges,21,3,"And they were like, yo Lord God of Israel, why is this happening in Israel? Like, why is there one tribe missing today?"
Judges,21,4,"The next day, the squad woke up super early and decided to go all out. They built this sick altar and made some epic burnt offerings and peace offerings, fam."
Judges,21,5,"So, the Israelite squad was like, yo, which one of our peeps from all the tribes didn't show up to worship the Lord with the crew? They had made a serious promise that anyone who ditched the gathering and didn't come to Mizpeh to worship the Lord would get straight up executed."
Judges,21,6,"So, like, the peeps of Israel felt hella sorry for Benjamin, their bro, and they were like, yo, it's whack that one tribe got totally cut off from Israel today!"
Judges,21,7,"Yo, how are we gonna find wives for the bros left, when we swore to the LORD that we wouldn't let 'em marry our daughters?"
Judges,21,8,"So they were like, yo, did any of the Israelite tribes not show up to Mizpeh to meet with the LORD? And, guess what, none of the peeps from Jabeshgilead came to join the crew at the camp."
Judges,21,9,"So, like, they counted all the people and, like, guess what? None of the peeps from Jabeshgilead were there! Crazy, right?"
Judges,21,10,"So, like, the whole group sent a bunch of seriously tough dudes, like 12k of them, and they were told to go and, you know, attack those peeps living in Jabeshgilead. They were supposed to, like, use their swords and stuff and go after everyone, even the ladies and kiddos."
Judges,21,11,So here's what you gotta do: completely wipe out all the guys and any women who've been with a man.
Judges,21,12,"So they came across four hundred young girls in Jabeshgilead who were still virgins, and had never been intimate with anyone. They brought them to the camp in Shiloh, which is in Canaan."
Judges,21,13,"Then the entire squad hit up the kids from Benjamin chilling in rock Rimmon, slide into their DMs, and calmly reach out to vibe with them. (but like, in a chill way)"
Judges,21,14,"So Benjamin showed up once more, and they hooked him up with some wives from the women of Jabeshgilead that they had spared. But even then, there weren't enough ladies to go around."
Judges,21,15,"And the peeps were like, oops, our bad for Benjamin, 'cause the big man upstairs caused a major divide among the Israelite squads."
Judges,21,16,"So, like, the elders of the crew were all like, yo, how do we find wives for the dudes who are still single, 'cause all the girls from Benjamin got wiped out, you know?"
Judges,21,17,"And they were like, 'Yo, we gotta hook up our Benjamin squad with some land so their tribe doesn't get wiped out in Israel.'"
Judges,21,18,"But yo, we can't be hooking up our daughters with those Benjamin dudes because the Israelites swore up and down that anyone who gives a wife to a Benjamin bro is straight up cursed."
Judges,21,19,"Yo, check it out, there's this lit party hosted by the LORD every year in Shiloh. It's located up north of Bethel, near the highway that goes from Bethel to Shechem, and just south of Lebonah. It goes down from year to year, and it's a prime spot east of the highway, facing the sunrising."
Judges,21,20,"So they told the peeps from Benjamin, like yo, go and hide in the vineyards, ya know?"
Judges,21,21,"Yo, listen up! Check it out, if the girls from Shiloh decide to come out and bust a move on the dance floor, then leave your vines behind and each of you find yourself a wife from the girls of Shiloh, and head over to the land of Benjamin."
Judges,21,22,"So, like, if their dads or bros come to us complaining, we'll be cool and say, 'Cut 'em some slack for our sake, okay? We didn't keep any wives for ourselves in the war. So it's not their fault, you know? Don't blame them.'"
Judges,21,23,"So, the people from Benjamin did just that. They got themselves some spouses from those who were busting moves on the dance floor, the ones they managed to catch. Then they made their way back to their ancestral land, fixed up the cities, and settled down in them."
Judges,21,24,"So the Israelites left from there, each person going back to their own tribe and family, and they all went to claim their own land."
Judges,21,25,"Back in the day, there was no king in Israel, so everyone just did whatever they thought was cool."
Ruth,1,1,"So, back in the old days when the judges were in charge, there was a major food shortage in the land. And there was this guy from Bethlehemjudah who decided to pack up and go to Moab with his wife and two sons to live for a while. Just so you know, when it says 'ruled,' it actually means 'judged' in Hebrew."
Ruth,1,2,"So this guy named Elimelech, his wife's name was Naomi, and they had two sons named Mahlon and Chilion. They were from Bethlehemjudah, and they decided to go to Moab and stay there for a while."
Ruth,1,3,"So, like, Elimelech, who was totally Naomi's husband, passed away, leaving her alone with their two sons."
Ruth,1,4,"So, they ended up marrying some Moabite wives, one named Orpah and the other named Ruth, and they lived there for like ten whole years."
Ruth,1,5,"So like, Mahlon and Chilion passed away, like totally both of them! And now the woman was left all alone without her two sons and her husband."
Ruth,1,6,"So, like, Naomi and her daughters-in-law left Moab to go back to their hometown because they heard that the Lord had like, totally shown kindness to his people by providing them with food and stuff."
Ruth,1,7,So she and her two daughters-in-law left the place they were staying and started heading back to Judah.
Ruth,1,8,"So Naomi was like, 'Hey girls, it's time to go back to your mom's crib. May the LORD bless you both for being so cool to the deceased and to me.'"
Ruth,1,9,"May the LORD give you all the vibes of chillness, so that each one of you can find some downtime with your significant other. After that, she gave them a hug and they couldn't help but cry their hearts out."
Ruth,1,10,"And they were like, for sure we gonna come with you to your squad."
Ruth,1,11,"Naomi was like, 'Listen up, my girls. Why you wanna roll with me? You think I got more sons in my belly waiting to be your baes?'"
Ruth,1,12,"You know what, babes? Y'all should go on your own path, 'cause I'm way too old to find myself a man. Even if I wanted to, it's not like I'm gonna magically get married tonight and pop out some kids, ya feel me?"
Ruth,1,13,"Wait around for these dudes until they're adults? Delay your chances of getting husbands? Nah, my girls, I'm so bummed because it seems like the Lord is totally against me."
Ruth,1,14,"And they started crying again, and Orpah gave her mother-in-law a kiss; but Ruth stuck by her side."
Ruth,1,15,"So, like, check it out, your sister-in-law, she like totally went back to her peeps and to her gods. You should def go after her, fam."
Ruth,1,16,"And Ruth was like, dude, don't even think about telling me to bounce and go back. Like, wherever you go, I'll go. And wherever you crash, I'll crash too. Your crew will be my crew, and your God will be my God, no cap. Don't even try to be against me, fam."
Ruth,1,17,"I'm totally down to die where you die and get buried there too. Like, seriously, if anything separates us except death, may God punish me big time."
Ruth,1,18,"When she realized that her friend was determined to go with her, she stopped trying to convince her."
Ruth,1,19,"So, like, the two of them went all the way to Bethlehem. And when they arrived, the whole city was like, shooketh by their presence. They were all like, 'Wait, is that Naomi?'"
Ruth,1,20,"And she was like, don't even call me Naomi, call me Mara, 'cause God has been hella harsh with me. {Naomi, which means Pleasant} {Mara, yo, that means Bitter}"
Ruth,1,21,"I started off with everything, but now I'm back with nothing, and you guys are still calling me Naomi? Don't you see that the Lord has spoken against me and I've been hit hard by the Almighty?"
Ruth,1,22,"So Naomi went back to Bethlehem with her daughter-in-law Ruth, who came from Moab. They arrived at Bethlehem just as the barley harvest was starting."
Ruth,2,1,"Naomi had this guy who was related to her late husband, and he was like, super rich and powerful. His fam was from the Elimelech crew, and his name was Boaz. (Boaz, also known as Booz in Greek slang)"
Ruth,2,2,"So Ruth, this cool chick from Moab, told Naomi, 'Hey, I wanna go to the field and pick some corn in front of someone who will totally dig me.' And Naomi was like, 'Sure thing, my girl, go ahead.'"
Ruth,2,3,"So she went and started picking up leftover crops in the field after the workers. Luckily, she ended up in a section of the field owned by Boaz, who was related to Elimelech."
Ruth,2,4,"Yo, check it out, Boaz just rolled up from Bethlehem and was like, 'Sup, my fellow reapers? May the LORD be with y'all.' And the reapers were like, 'Back at ya, man! May the LORD bless you!'"
Ruth,2,5,"Boaz asked his servant in charge of the reapers, like yo, who's that girl over there?"
Ruth,2,6,"And the person in charge of the workers replied, like, 'Oh, it's that Moab chick who rolled back with Naomi from Moab, you know?'"
Ruth,2,7,"So she's like, 'Hey, can I join in and collect some leftover grain after the workers?'. And she's been at it since morning, chillin' with the crew, except for a quick break in the house."
Ruth,2,8,"Boaz was like, yo Ruth, you hear me? Don't even think about going to some other field to collect grain - stick around here with my girls, no need to bounce:"
Ruth,2,9,"Just keep an eye on the field where they're harvesting and follow after them. Haven't I told the guys not to bother you? And if you're thirsty, feel free to grab a drink from the containers that the guys have filled up."
Ruth,2,10,"And she like, totally fell down on her face and bowed down, and was like, 'Why are you being so nice to me? I mean, I'm just a random stranger, like, why are you even bothering to notice me?'}"
Ruth,2,11,"Boaz was like, 'Yo, I heard about all the awesome stuff you did for your mother-in-law ever since your hubby passed away. Leaving your parents and your hometown to come to this place with a bunch of strangers, respect!'"
Ruth,2,12,"May the LORD bless and reward all your hard work, and may you receive a generous blessing from the LORD God of Israel, in whom you have found refuge."
Ruth,2,13,"Then she was like, 'Yo, can I get some love in your eyes, my dude? You've totally been there for me, and you've been mad chill with your words to your girl, even though I'm not like your other girls. {Can I get some...: or, Can I find} {chill: Hebrew literal translation: to the heart}"
Ruth,2,14,"Boaz was like, 'Hey, come over here during lunch and grab some bread. Dip it in the vinegar if you want. Sit with the reapers.' So she joined the crew, and Boaz hooked her up with some roasted corn. She ate her fill and still had some leftovers."
Ruth,2,15,"So, like, when she got up to gather what was left behind, Boaz told his crew, like, 'Yo, let her pick from the good stuff, even among the piles, and don't give her any crap or anything, ya know?'"
Ruth,2,16,"And, like, drop a few of those good vibes for her, and let her pick them up, without hating on her or anything."
Ruth,2,17,"So, like, she was gathering in the field until it got dark, and she separated all the stuff she gathered, and it was, like, a crazy amount of barley."
Ruth,2,18,"Then she picked it up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gathered. So she brought it out and gave her what she had saved after she had eaten enough."
Ruth,2,19,"So her mother-in-law asks her, 'Where did you get all those goodies today? And where did you work? Major props to the person who noticed you.' And she spills the tea to her mother-in-law, saying, 'I worked with this guy named Boaz today.'"
Ruth,2,20,"Naomi told her daughter-in-law, Praisee the Lord for the guy who hasn't stopped being kind to the living and the dead!' Naomi continued, 'He's actually a close relative of ours, one of our fam. He has the right to take care of us and make things right.'"
Ruth,2,21,"So Ruth, this cool girl from Moab, was like, 'Yo, he straight up told me to stick with his crew until they finish all our harvest.'"
Ruth,2,22,"And Naomi told Ruth, her daughter-in-law, 'Hey, girl, it's safe for you to hang out with the other ladies who work for him. This way, you won't randomly bump into them in some other field.'"
Ruth,2,23,"So, she stuck around with her squad of Boaz's peeps and kept hustling until the barley and wheat harvest were over. She chilled with her mother-in-law during that time."
Ruth,3,1,"Yo, Naomi (her mother-in-law) was like, 'Hey girl, shouldn't I try to find you some peace and happiness so that things work out for you?'"
Ruth,3,2,"And BTW, isn't Boaz, like, one of our fam? You know, the dude you used to hang out with his squad? Well, guess what? He's gonna be doing some serious barley separating tonight at the threshing floor."
Ruth,3,3,"So, like, freshen up and look fly, put on your best outfit, and head down to the party. Just, you know, hide your identity until the dude is done grubbing and sipping."
Ruth,3,4,"When he's about to sleep, you gotta remember where he's gonna lie down. Then, you gotta slide in there, uncover his feet, and get comfy. Trust me, he's gonna spill all the info you need."
Ruth,3,5,"And she was like, 'Girl, I'm totally down! I'll do everything you tell me to do.'"
Ruth,3,6,So she went to the floor and did everything her mother-in-law told her to do.
Ruth,3,7,"And after Boaz finished eating and drinking, and he was feeling pretty good, he went to crash at the end of the pile of crops. Then she came over quietly, uncovered his feet, and laid down next to him."
Ruth,3,8,"So, like, in the middle of the night, this dude got super scared and turned around. And guess what? There was a woman lying right at his feet. Like, he grabbed hold of her or something, you know?"
Ruth,3,9,"And he was like, 'Yo, who are you?' And she was like, 'Sup, I'm Ruth, your girl. Can you like, cover me with your skirt, because you're like fam and have the hookup to redeem me or something?'"
Ruth,3,10,"And he was like, yo, you're so blessed by the big man upstairs, my girl. Like, you've shown way more love and kindness recently than before. I mean, you didn't go after all those young dudes, whether they were broke or loaded."
Ruth,3,11,"Hey girl, don't worry! I've got your back and I'll totally hook you up with whatever you need. 'Cause everyone knows you're a solid and righteous chick. The whole crew in our community knows it, you know?"
Ruth,3,12,"So, like, it's actually true that I'm, you know, your close relative and all. But, um, there's actually someone who's an even closer relative than me."
Ruth,3,13,"Stay here tonight and in the morning, if he's down to be a bro and do what's right, let him do his bro duties. But if he's not gonna step up as a bro for you, then I'll step up and be a bro for you, swear on everything, chill out until morning."
Ruth,3,14,"And she stayed by his side till morning: and she got up before anyone could recognize each other. And he said, Let's keep it a secret that a girl came to the place."
Ruth,3,15,"Then he was like, yo, bring that thing you got on, and hold it. So she held it, and he gave her, like, six measures of barley, and put it on her. And she went into the city with it."
Ruth,3,16,"And when she finally reached her mother-in-law, she was like, 'Yo, who dis?', and she spilled all the tea about what the dude did to her."
Ruth,3,17,"So, like, she told me, he gave me these six portions of barley, because he was like, 'Don't go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed, okay?'"
Ruth,3,18,"She was like, 'Chillax, my girl, don't stress until you see how it all plays out. This dude won't rest until he's done with what he's gotta do today.'"
Ruth,4,1,"So Boaz went to the spot by the gate and chilled there. And guess what, the relative that Boaz talked about showed up; so Boaz was like, 'Yo, dude! Come over here, take a seat.' And sure enough, the guy turned aside and sat down."
Ruth,4,2,"Then he grabbed ten of the OGs from the town and was like, 'Take a seat, fam.' And they were like, 'Bet,' and chilled out."
Ruth,4,3,"So basically, this guy comes up to Naomi, who just came back from Moab, and tells her that she's selling a piece of land that belonged to our brother, Elimelech."
Ruth,4,4,"So I had this idea to let everyone know, like, you should totally buy it in front of all the people and the important ones from my crew. If you wanna be the one to buy it, go ahead and buy it. But if you're not interested, just let me know, you know? 'Cause no one else can buy it except for you, and I'm next in line. And then he was like, 'Yeah, I'll buy it.'"
Ruth,4,5,"Yo, Boaz was like, 'Listen up! When you're buying that field from Naomi, you gotta scoop up Ruth the Moabitess too. She's the wife of the deceased, and you gotta make sure his name lives on through his inheritance.'"
Ruth,4,6,"The relative was like, nah, I can't buy it back for myself 'cause it'll mess up my own inheritance. So, you go ahead and buy it back for yourself, 'cause I can't do it."
Ruth,4,7,"So back in the day in Israel, when someone wanted to make a deal or make things official, they had this cool tradition. They would take off their shoe and give it to their friend as a way of saying, 'Hey, this deal is legit!' It was like a special symbol of trust and testimony among the people of Israel."
Ruth,4,8,"So like, the relative told Boaz, 'Hey dude, go ahead and buy it.' And Boaz was like, 'Sure, man!' And then he took off his shoe."
Ruth,4,9,"So Boaz was like, yo elders and everyone, listen up! I just wanna make it clear today that I've totally scored all of Elimelech's stuff, and also Chilion and Mahlon's stuff, directly from Naomi herself."
Ruth,4,10,"So like, I totally bought Ruth, the Moabitess babe and wife of Mahlon, to be my wifey. My intention is to keep the name of the deceased alive on his property, so his name won't be forgotten by his peeps and won't disappear from the fam or the community. Y'all are totally witnesses to this, ya know!"
Ruth,4,11,"And everyone at the entrance, including the older folks, said, 'We swear!' May the Lord bless the lady who came into your house, just like Rachel and Leah, who contributed to the growth of Israel. May you do great things in Ephratah and gain popularity in Bethlehem. May you become successful and well-known, spreading your name far and wide."
Ruth,4,12,"May your crib be as lit as Pharez's crib, whom Tamar slayed as a mom for Judah, representing the dope offspring that the LORD will bless you with from this baddie."
Ruth,4,13,"So Boaz and Ruth became a thing, and they got married. When they did the thing, the LORD blessed them with a baby boy."
Ruth,4,14,"And the women were like, OMG Naomi, you are so blessed! The Lord has totally hooked you up today with a kinsman, like, seriously awesome. He's gonna be, like, famous in Israel and all. Woohoo! 🙌"
Ruth,4,15,"He's gonna be like your life-saver, the one who takes care of you in your old age. Your daughter-in-law, who loves you even more than seven sons could, has given birth to him. He's gonna be the one who nourishes you when you're old and gray."
Ruth,4,16,"So Naomi picked up the baby and cradled them against her chest, taking care of them like a loving aunt."
Ruth,4,17,"So, like, all the ladies in the hood were like, 'OMG, Naomi had a baby boy!' and they named him Obed. He's, like, the OG father of Jesse, who's, like, the OG father of David."
Ruth,4,18,"So like, here's the story of Pharez and his descendants: Pharez had a son named Hezron,"
Ruth,4,19,"And Hezron had a kid named Ram, who later had a son named Amminadab,"
Ruth,4,20,"And Amminadab had a son named Nahshon, and Nahshon had a son named Salmon, {Salmon: or, Salmah}"
Ruth,4,21,"And Salmon had a kid named Boaz, and Boaz had a kid named Obed,"
Ruth,4,22,"And Obed had a kid named Jesse, and Jesse had a kid named David."
1 Samuel,1,1,"So, there was this dude from Ramathaimzophim, up on mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah. He was the son of Jeroham, who was the son of Elihu, who was the son of Tohu, who was the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite."
1 Samuel,1,2,"So this guy had two wifey material girls - one named Hannah and the other named Peninnah. Turns out, Peninnah was popping out kids left and right, but poor Hannah couldn't have any children."
1 Samuel,1,3,"So this guy would bounce from his city every year to worship and make offerings to the big man upstairs, the LORD of hosts, in Shiloh. And Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, who were the LORD's priests, were also there. (Yearly means from year to year, in case you were wondering!)"
1 Samuel,1,4,"And when Elkanah was about to offer, he shared some of the goodies with Peninnah, his wifey, and all her kiddos:"
1 Samuel,1,5,"But Hannah got an extra special blessing because she had earned it—God really loved her! But unfortunately, God closed up her womb and she couldn't have any kids. {extra special: or, twice as much}"
1 Samuel,1,6,"And the other girl kept on teasing her and making her upset, just to bother her, because God had not allowed her to have children."
1 Samuel,1,7,"And every year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, her rival would get under her skin so much that she would start crying and refuse to eat."
1 Samuel,1,8,"Elkanah, Hannah's husband, asked her, 'Why are you crying and not eating? Why is your heart heavy? Aren't I worth more to you than ten sons?'"
1 Samuel,1,9,"So Hannah got up after they had finished eating in Shiloh, and after they had clinked their drinks. Now Eli the priest was chilling on a seat next to a post in the LORD's temple."
1 Samuel,1,10,"And she was feeling really down and prayed to the LORD with all her heart, crying a lot."
1 Samuel,1,11,"And she made a promise, saying, O powerful God, if you really pay attention to the difficult situation I'm in, and remember me, and don't forget about me, but grant me a baby boy, then I'll dedicate him to you for his entire life, and he won't cut his hair."
1 Samuel,1,12,"And it happened, as she kept on praying before the LORD, that Eli noticed her speaking fervently. {continued...: Heb. kept multiplying her prayers}"
1 Samuel,1,13,"So Hannah, like, she was praying in her head - her lips were moving but no sound came out. So Eli thought she was wasted or something."
1 Samuel,1,14,"Eli was like, 'Yo, how much longer you gonna keep sippin' on that booze? Put that wine down already.'"
1 Samuel,1,15,"Hannah replied, like, nah, my dude, I'm, like, totally down in the dumps. I haven't even had a sip of wine or any other strong drink. Instead, I've been pouring out my heart to the LORD. It's been tough, you know?"
1 Samuel,1,16,"Don't label me, your girl, as some child of evil vibes. 'Cause everything I've been expressing so far is just a overflow of my ventings and sadness, yeah. {complaint: or, deep thoughts}"
1 Samuel,1,17,"And then Eli was like, 'You good, bro? May the God of Israel totally hook you up with that thing you asked for.'"
1 Samuel,1,18,"She was like, 'Yo, please be cool with me and show me some love.' After that, she bounced, had a good meal, and suddenly she wasn't feeling down anymore."
1 Samuel,1,19,"The next morning, they woke up early and gave reverence to the LORD, then went back to their crib in Ramah. Elkanah and Hannah, his wifey, slayed the intimacy game, and the LORD had their back and showed Hannah some love."
1 Samuel,1,20,"So, after some time, when Hannah got pregnant, she gave birth to a son and named him Samuel. She said, 'I asked the Lord for him.'"
1 Samuel,1,21,"So Elkanah and his whole fam decided to head up to the LORD's place and offer the yearly sacrifice, like they promised."
1 Samuel,1,22,"But Hannah didn't go up; she told her husband, 'I'm not gonna go up until the baby is weaned, and then I'll bring him to appear before the LORD and stay there forever.'"
1 Samuel,1,23,"Elkanah, her hubby, was like, 'Yo, do whatever you think is right. Just chill until you stop breastfeeding him. But for real, may the Lord fulfill what He promised.' So the woman stayed put and breastfed her son until he was weaned."
1 Samuel,1,24,"After she was done breastfeeding him, she brought him along with three big dudes, a ton of flour, a bottle of wine, and took him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh. And this kid was still just a youngin'."
1 Samuel,1,25,"So they had a cow, and took the kid to Eli."
1 Samuel,1,26,"And she was like, OMG my dude, I swear on your life, my dude, I'm the girl who was right here with you, totally praying to the LORD."
1 Samuel,1,27,"I totally prayed for this kid, and the LORD hooked me up with exactly what I asked for, no cap:"
1 Samuel,1,28,"So, basically, I've given him to God, like loaning him out. As long as he's alive, he'll be dedicated to God. And he worshipped God there. {loaned him: or, gave him back, after getting him through prayer} {he shall...: or, the one I got through prayer shall be given back}"
1 Samuel,2,1,"So Hannah prayed and she was like, 'OMG, my heart is so happy because of the LORD! Like, I feel so powerful and confident because of Him. I can't even! My words are full of victory and I totally slay my enemies, because I'm all about celebrating Your saving grace.'"
1 Samuel,2,2,"No one can match the holiness of the LORD, 'cause there's nobody else like Him. No one's as solid and awesome as our God."
1 Samuel,2,3,"Don't talk so arrogantly anymore, seriously. Like, no need to be all full of yourself, okay? 'Cause the LORD is, like, super knowledgeable and everything we do gets weighed by Him, you know? So, let's keep it humble, fam. #Blessed"
1 Samuel,2,4,"The super strong warriors' bows got wrecked, and the clumsy ones are now rockin' some serious strength."
1 Samuel,2,5,"Those who were well-fed have started working for food, and those who were hungry have stopped starving. As a result, the infertile woman has miraculously given birth to seven children, while the woman with many kids has become weak and tired."
1 Samuel,2,6,God can take lives and restore them; He can humble and exalt.
1 Samuel,2,7,"God can make someone broke or ballin', He can humble ya or raise ya up."
1 Samuel,2,8,"He brings the underprivileged out of their struggles, lift them from the lowest points, to elevate them among the influential, and grant them a fulfilling legacy. The foundation of the world belongs to the LORD, as He establishes it upon His authority."
1 Samuel,2,9,"He's got his saints' backs, and the wicked will be hella quiet in the dark; 'cause nobody can win by flexing alone."
1 Samuel,2,10,"The haters of the LORD are gonna get wrecked; He's gonna let loose some heavenly thunder on them: The LORD is gonna judge the whole earth, and give his king mad strength, and raise up the power of his chosen one."
1 Samuel,2,11,So Elkanah went home to Ramah. And the kid started serving the LORD under Priest Eli.
1 Samuel,2,12,"So, like, Eli's sons were totally sons of Belial, you know? They had no clue about the LORD."
1 Samuel,2,13,"So, like, the priests had this thing going on with the people where, when a dude wanted to offer a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come over while the meat was cooking, holding this three-pronged meat hook, you know?"
1 Samuel,2,14,"And he like, put it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; and whatever the cool fleshhook pulled out, the priest straight up snagged it for himself. So they totally did that in Shiloh for all the Israelites who rolled up there."
1 Samuel,2,15,"Yo, before they burned that fat, the priest's servant pulled up and said to the guy sacrificing, 'Yo, hook it up with some meat to roast for the priest. He ain't tryna eat no cooked meat, fam, he wants it raw.'"
1 Samuel,2,16,"And if someone tells him, 'Don't forget to roast the fat right away and take as much as you want,' he would reply, 'Actually, I want it now. And if you don't give it to me, I'll take it forcefully.'"
1 Samuel,2,17,"Yo, the young dudes were hella sinning in front of the LORD, 'cause people straight up despised the offerings made to the LORD."
1 Samuel,2,18,"Samuel was like, straight up serving the LORD, and get this—he was just a kid, rockin' a cool linen ephod!"
1 Samuel,2,19,"And like, his mom would totally make him this cool little outfit, and she'd bring it to him every year when they all went up together for the big sacrifice thing."
1 Samuel,2,20,"Eli gave his blessings to Elkanah and his wife, saying, may the LORD grant you a child from this woman, just like she requested. Then they went back to their crib."
1 Samuel,2,21,"So, like, God totally came through for Hannah and she got preggers and had three sons and two daughters. And this kid Samuel, he grew up all holy and stuff right in front of God's eyes."
1 Samuel,2,22,"So, like, Eli was, like, super old and he totally knew everything his sons were doing to all the people of Israel. And, uh, they were, like, hooking up with the women who were hanging out by the entrance of the meeting place. You know, that place where everyone gathered and stuff. Uh, it says 'assembled by troops' in the original Hebrew, whatever that means."
1 Samuel,2,23,"He was like, 'Why are you doing all this messed up stuff? I'm hearing about all your shady business from everyone.'"
1 Samuel,2,24,"Nah, bros, not gonna lie, I'm getting some seriously bad vibes here. Word on the street is that you're making the LORD's crew go off track. Like, it's not cool, you feel me?"
1 Samuel,2,25,"If someone wrongs another person, the judge will make a ruling, but if someone disrespects the LORD, who can plead their case? Even so, they ignored their father's advice because the LORD intended to punish them."
1 Samuel,2,26,"And Samuel, the kid, kept on leveling up and he was well-liked by both the LORD and everyone around him."
1 Samuel,2,27,"So, this guy who's totally connected with God, came up to Eli and straight up said, 'Listen up, bro. The Almighty is telling you, like did He not make it crystal clear back in the day to your family back in Egypt, when they were chilling in Pharaoh's crib?"
1 Samuel,2,28,"Like, did I specifically pick him from, like, all the tribes of Israel to be my priest and do all these lit things like offering sacrifices on my altar, burning incense, and rocking that ephod in front of me? And didn't I also give the offerings the Israelites brought to the house of your dad?"
1 Samuel,2,29,"Why are you dissing my sacrifice and offering that I specifically told you to do in my house? And why are you honoring your sons more than me, trying to get all the best stuff from the offerings of my people, Israel?"
1 Samuel,2,30,"So, like, the LORD God of Israel is saying, I totally said that your family, including your dad's fam, were gonna be all righteous and stuff forever. But now the LORD is like, uh-uh, not happening. 'Cause those who show respect for me will be respected, but those who diss me will be totally put down."
1 Samuel,2,31,"Yo, listen up! The future's lookin' rough for ya - I'm about to take away your arm and the arms of everyone in your family, leavin' no old dudes left in your crib."
1 Samuel,2,32,"And you're gonna have some serious trouble in your crib, with all the blessings that God's gonna give Israel. Plus, there won't be any OGs chillin' in your house for good."
1 Samuel,2,33,"And anyone from your family who remains at my altar will cause you distress and sadness. Moreover, your descendants will die young, before their time."
1 Samuel,2,34,"Yo, listen up! Here's a sign for you, specifically for your boys Hophni and Phinehas. On the same day, they're gonna kick the bucket - both of 'em."
1 Samuel,2,35,"And I'm gonna bring up this really loyal priest, who's gonna do everything that I have in mind and in my heart. I'm gonna make sure he has a solid foundation, and he'll serve my chosen one forever."
1 Samuel,2,36,"And it will happen that whoever is still in your house will come and bow down to him, asking for a bit of cash and a bite to eat, saying, please let me join the priests' squad so I can grab a snack."
1 Samuel,3,1,"So like, Samuel was totally serving the LORD under Eli. And let me tell you, the word of the LORD was like super valuable back then, 'cause there weren't any visions happening."
1 Samuel,3,2,"So, like, this happened when Eli was lying down in his spot and his vision started getting blurry, like, he couldn't see anything anymore."
1 Samuel,3,3,"And before the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was getting some rest;"
1 Samuel,3,4,"So, like, God totally called out to Samuel and he was like, 'Yo, here I am, what's up?'"
1 Samuel,3,5,"So he went up to Eli and was like, 'Yo, you called me?' And Eli was like, 'Nah bro, I didn't call you. Go back to bed.' And the dude went back and crashed."
1 Samuel,3,6,"Yo, the LORD hit up Samuel once again. So Samuel got up and went to Eli, saying, 'Here I am, you called me?' But Eli was like, 'Nah, my dude, I didn't call you. Go back to bed.'"
1 Samuel,3,7,"At that time, Samuel didn't actually know God yet, and God hadn't revealed His message to him either. (Just so you know, this all happened before Samuel had a personal relationship with God or received His divine instructions.)"
1 Samuel,3,8,"Then, like, the LORD called Samuel again, you know, for the third time, and Samuel was all like, 'Okay, okay, I'm coming!' So he got up and went to Eli, and was like, 'Yo, you called me?' And Eli realized that it was actually the LORD who had called the kid."
1 Samuel,3,9,"So Eli was like yo, Samuel, go chillax and lay down. If you hear someone calling you, say 'What's up, LORD? I'm all ears.' So Samuel did as Eli said and went to crash in his spot."
1 Samuel,3,10,"Then God showed up and was like, 'Samuel, Samuel!' And Samuel was like, 'Yo, what's up? I'm listening, talk to me.'"
1 Samuel,3,11,"So, like, God was all like, 'Yo, Samuel! Check it out, I'm about to make something happen in Israel that'll totally blow everyone's mind, like their ears will be ringing and stuff.'"
1 Samuel,3,12,"On that day, I'm gonna do everything I said I would against Eli and his family. Once I start, I won't stop until it's finished. It's gonna be epic, fam! #BeginningAndEnding"
1 Samuel,3,13,"So I'm like, telling him straight up that I'm gonna judge his whole fam forever, 'cause they're totally doing messed up stuff that they know is wrong. His sons are acting all disgusting and he's not even doing anything about it, not even giving them a disappointed look or anything."
1 Samuel,3,14,"So, I've, like, totally made this oath to Eli's family, that, like, their wickedness can't just be wiped away with sacrifices or offerings, you know? Like, it's gonna stick with them forever."
1 Samuel,3,15,"So Samuel crashed at the crib all night, then woke up in the morning and unlocked the doors to God's house. But he was low-key stressed about sharing the vision with Eli."
1 Samuel,3,16,"So Eli called out to Samuel and was like, 'Yo, Samuel, my dude.' And Samuel was all like, 'What's up? I'm right here.'"
1 Samuel,3,17,"And he was like, dude, what did the LORD tell you? Seriously, don't keep it a secret from me, bro. I swear, if you hide anything from me, may God totally punish you and stuff. And I mean it, whatever He said to you, spill the tea. Like, seriously: don't hold anything back, ya know? {more also: Hebrew for, like, 'extra'} {thing: or, word}"
1 Samuel,3,18,"Samuel spilled all the tea, didn't hold back a thing. He was like, 'Yo, it's all God's plan, let Him do what He thinks is best.'"
1 Samuel,3,19,"Samuel was like, totally thriving, and God was like, always by his side, making sure none of his words went unnoticed."
1 Samuel,3,20,"And, like, everyone in Israel, from like Dan to Beersheba, totally knew that Samuel was, like, confirmed as a prophet of the LORD. #legit #faithful"
1 Samuel,3,21,"So, the LORD showed up again in Shiloh, 'cause that's where the LORD decided to reveal himself to Samuel. And guess how? Yeah, it was through the word of the LORD."
1 Samuel,4,1,"So, like, Samuel's message spread to all of Israel. And then, Israel decided to face off against the Philistines in, like, a fierce battle. They set up camp near Ebenezer, while the Philistines camped out in Aphek. It all went down, you know?"
1 Samuel,4,2,"So, like, the Philistines and Israel were totally facing off, and when they finally clashed, Israel got totally wrecked by the Philistines. They managed to take out about four thousand dudes in the field. Such a bummer, man!"
1 Samuel,4,3,"So, like, when the people finally reached the camp, the older peeps of Israel were like, 'Why did the LORD let us get beat by the Philistines today? Maybe we should bring the LORD's ark of the covenant from Shiloh, and like, when it's with us, it might rescue us from our enemies. {fetch: By the way, 'fetch' means 'take unto us'}"
1 Samuel,4,4,"So the people were like, 'Yo, let's go to Shiloh and bring the lit AF ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, you know, the one chillin' between them cherubims?' And Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were straight up there with the ark of the covenant of God."
1 Samuel,4,5,"And when the LORD's sacred ark rolled into the camp, all of Israel let out a massive shout that echoed through the earth."
1 Samuel,4,6,"And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they were like, 'Yo, what's up with this loud AF noise in the Hebrews' camp?' And they figured out that the ark of the LORD had arrived in the camp."
1 Samuel,4,7,"The Philistines were totally shook, 'cause they were like, dude, God just rolled up in our camp. And they were like, OMG, we're so screwed! This has never happened before, like seriously."
1 Samuel,4,8,"OMG, we're so screwed! Who's gonna save us from these mega powerful Gods? Like, these are the Gods who totally wrecked the Egyptians with all those insane plagues in the desert!"
1 Samuel,4,9,"Yo, Philistines, show some strength and dignity. Don't let yourselves be slaves to the Hebrews like they were to you. Step up, be courageous, and bring on the fight. Let's show some true manliness here!"
1 Samuel,4,10,"So like, the Philistines were all up in a fight with Israel, and Israel got totally wrecked, man. They ran for their lives, each one heading back to their own tent. It was a total bloodbath, like thirty thousand warriors from Israel bit the dust, dude."
1 Samuel,4,11,"So, like, the sacred ark of God got snatched, and Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, got wrecked. Yeah, they straight-up died. #NoMercy"
1 Samuel,4,12,"So this guy from the Benjamin squad straight up booked it out of there and showed up in Shiloh the same day, all disheveled with his ripped clothes and dirt all over his head."
1 Samuel,4,13,"And when he arrived, like, Eli was chilling on a seat by the side of the road, keeping an eye out, 'cause he was mad worried about the ark of God. So when the guy came into the city and spilled the tea, everyone in the city straight up freaked out."
1 Samuel,4,14,"And when Eli heard all that noise and commotion, he was like, 'Yo, what's up with this chaos?' And this guy rushed in and spilled the tea to Eli."
1 Samuel,4,15,"So Eli was, like, almost a hundred years old and his eyesight was, like, really bad. He couldn't see anything."
1 Samuel,4,16,"The guy told Eli, I'm the dude who bolted from the army today. And Eli asked, What happened, my dude? What's the deal?"
1 Samuel,4,17,"Yo, the messenger responded like, 'Dude, Israel totally got wrecked by the Philistines! It was a serious bloodbath out there. Oh, and by the way, your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas? Yeah, they're gone. And guess what? The ark of God got snatched too.'"
1 Samuel,4,18,"So, this one time, when he was talking about the ark of God, he accidentally fell off his seat, backwards, right by the gate. His neck snapped and he died because, well, he was old and pretty hefty. By the way, he had been the judge of Israel for a solid forty years."
1 Samuel,4,19,"And Phinehas' wife, who was gonna have a baby soon, heard the news that the ark of God was captured and that her father-in-law and husband had passed away. She got all emotional and started having contractions, 'cause the pain hit her hard."
1 Samuel,4,20,"And when she was about to pass away, the women standing by her said, 'Don't be afraid, for you have given birth to a son.' But she did not respond, nor did she pay any attention to it."
1 Samuel,4,21,"And she gave the child the name Ichabod, saying, 'The vibes have left Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband. {Ichabod: which means, Where is the glow-up? or, There is no glow-up}'"
1 Samuel,4,22,"Yo, she was like, 'OMG, the swag is totally gone from Israel! The legit ark of God got snatched away!'"
1 Samuel,5,1,"So, like, the Philistines, they totally grabbed the ark of God and, like, transferred it all the way from Ebenezer to Ashdod."
1 Samuel,5,2,"So like, when the Philistines grabbed the sacred box of God, they totally brought it into the house of Dagon and just plopped it down next to Dagon."
1 Samuel,5,3,"So, like, the next morning, when the people of Ashdod woke up, guess what? Dagon totally faceplanted on the ground in front of the LORD's ark. They had to pick up Dagon and put him back in his spot."
1 Samuel,5,4,"And like, the next morning when they woke up, they saw that Dagon had totally fallen flat on his face in front of the LORD's ark. His head and hands were completely cut off on the threshold, man. Only a tiny stump of Dagon was left. You know, like, the fishy part."
1 Samuel,5,5,"So like, none of those priests that worship Dagon, or anyone who enters Dagon's crib in Ashdod, dare to step on Dagon's front porch up until now."
1 Samuel,5,6,"But God's power hit hard against the people of Ashdod, and he brought destruction upon them. They were struck with a severe affliction called emerods, affecting not only Ashdod, but the surrounding areas as well."
1 Samuel,5,7,"So, when the dudes from Ashdod peeped that it went like that, they were like, 'No way can we keep this Israel God's ark with us. It's totally wrecking us and our god Dagon.'"
1 Samuel,5,8,"So they hit up all the top Philistine bosses and were like, 'Yo, what should we do with this ark of the God of Israel?' And the bosses were like, 'Just take that God of Israel's ark over to Gath and move it around there.' So, that's exactly what they did, they moved that ark of the God of Israel over there."
1 Samuel,5,9,"So, like, after they carried it around, the LORD was totally not happy with the city and caused some serious destruction. He totally wrecked the dudes in the city, no matter if they were young or old, and they ended up with some unpleasant physical issues."
1 Samuel,5,10,"So they sent the God's ark to Ekron. And when the God's ark arrived in Ekron, the people there freaked out, saying, 'OMG, they brought the God of Israel's ark here to kill us and our peeps. Like seriously, they wanna slay me and my squad!'"
1 Samuel,5,11,"So they rounded up all the big shots of the Philistines and were like, 'Yo, let's bounce the ark of the God of Israel back to where it came from before it wrecks us and our peeps. The city is getting wrecked left and right - no doubt, the hand of God is coming down hard here.'"
1 Samuel,5,12,"And those who didn't die were struck with a terrible disease, and the whole city was in agony and shocked."
1 Samuel,6,1,"So, like, the Lord's ark stayed with the Philistines for, like, a solid seven months."
1 Samuel,6,2,"So the Philistines were like, 'Yo, we need some priests and diviners to help us out here. What should we do with this ark of the LORD? Tell us how to send it back to where it belongs.'"
1 Samuel,6,3,"And they were like, listen up, if you're gonna ditch the ark of the God of Israel, don't just send it away with nothing. You better make sure to send a trespass offering back with it. Only then will you be healed and understand why God's like not chillin' with you anymore."
1 Samuel,6,4,"So they were like, 'What should we give as a way to make up for our wrongs?' And they were like, 'Let's give five gold statues of tumors and five gold statues of mice, to represent the number of Philistine rulers. That's because all of you and your rulers have been affected by the same plague.'"
1 Samuel,6,5,"So, like, you should create, uh, pictures or something of your diseases and the rodents that are causin' trouble in your land. And, you know, give props to the God of Israel. Maybe then He'll back off with His punishment and take it easy on you, your gods, and your land."
1 Samuel,6,6,"So, why are you being so stubborn, like the Egyptians and Pharaoh who were also stubborn? Didn't they finally let the people go after seeing all the amazing things that happened? And then the people left?"
1 Samuel,6,7,"So, like, go ahead and get a fresh new cart and grab two cows that haven't been used for any work, and tie those cows to the cart. After that, bring their baby cows back to your place."
1 Samuel,6,8,"Yo, grab the LORD's ark and put it on the cart. Don't forget to place the gold jewels, like the ones you're returning for the trespass offering, in a box next to it. Then, send it off on its way."
1 Samuel,6,9,"So, like, if that thing goes in the direction of his own place, towards Bethshemesh, then it's like he's totally responsible for bringing us this huge disaster. But if it doesn't, then we'll know for sure that it wasn't him who attacked us. It was just some random coincidence that messed us up. Like, seriously, he had nothing to do with it."
1 Samuel,6,10,"So the guys did it; they grabbed two lit cows, tied them to the cart, and left their cute calves at home:"
1 Samuel,6,11,"So they put the LORD's ark on the cart, along with the chest filled with gold mice and their statues of tumors."
1 Samuel,6,12,"And the cows went straight towards Bethshemesh, walking along the road, mooing as they went, without turning to the right or left. The leaders of the Philistines followed them all the way to the border of Bethshemesh."
1 Samuel,6,13,"So, the people of Bethshemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley, you know? And suddenly, they looked up and spotted the ark, and man, they were stoked to see that thing!"
1 Samuel,6,14,"So, like, the cart rolled up into Joshua's field in Bethshemesh and just stopped, right next to this huge stone. And then they, like, broke apart the wood from the cart and made a burnt offering out of the cows for the LORD."
1 Samuel,6,15,"Then the Levites brought down the ark of the LORD, along with the container that had all the awesome gold stuff in it, and placed them on this massive rock. And the people of Bethshemesh made burnt offerings and sacrifice to the LORD on that very day."
1 Samuel,6,16,"And when the five big shots of the Philistines peeped {that}, they bounced back to Ekron ASAP."
1 Samuel,6,17,"And yo, these are the shiny lumps that the Philistines brought back as an offering to apologize to the LORD; one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Askelon, one for Gath, and one for Ekron."
1 Samuel,6,18,"And there were golden mice, like, a bunch of them for all the cities of the Philistines under the control of the five bosses. They had these mice in their fancy cities and also in the smaller towns, all the way up to this huge rock called Abel where they left the ark of the LORD. That rock is still there in Joshua's field today, in the town of Bethshemite. It's pretty gnarly, right?!"
1 Samuel,6,19,"And like, God totally wrecked the guys from Bethshemesh 'cause they peeked into the LORD's ark. He smacked down like fifty thousand and seventy dudes, and everyone was bummed 'cause God smoked a bunch of people in a major beatdown."
1 Samuel,6,20,"The dudes from Bethshemesh were like, yo who can even handle being in the presence of this all-powerful LORD God? Like, who can measure up to Him and meet Him face-to-face?"
1 Samuel,6,21,"So these people hit up the folks in Kirjathjearim and were like, 'Yo, the Philistines brought back the LORD's ark. Come through and bring it over here.'"
1 Samuel,7,1,"So, like, the dudes from Kirjathjearim showed up, totally grabbed the ark of the LORD, and took it to Abinadab's crib up on the hill. They totally set apart Eleazar, his son, to be in charge of looking after the ark of the LORD."
1 Samuel,7,2,"So, the ark was chillin' in Kirjathjearim for a long time, like, twenty years, and all the people of Israel were feeling super bummed out, like, really missing the LORD."
1 Samuel,7,3,"So Samuel was talking to all the peeps in Israel, and he was like, yo, if you want to get right with the LORD, you gotta get rid of those weird gods and idols you're into, and focus your hearts on God, and like, only serve Him. If you do that, He'll totally save you from the Philistines, no joke."
1 Samuel,7,4,"So the Israelites totally ditched Baalim and Ashtaroth, and started vibing with the LORD only."
1 Samuel,7,5,"So Samuel was like, yo, call all of Israel to Mizpeh, and I'll hit up the LORD with my prayers for you, fam."
1 Samuel,7,6,"So they all met up in Mizpeh, grabbed some water, and poured it out as an offering to the LORD. They decided to fast that day and admitted, 'We messed up big time by disobeying the LORD.' And Samuel took charge of leading and guiding the people of Israel in Mizpeh."
1 Samuel,7,7,"So, like, when the Philistines found out that the Israelites were all meeting up at Mizpeh, the Philistine bosses rolled up on Israel. And, bro, when the Israelites heard about it, they got scared of the Philistines and stuff."
1 Samuel,7,8,"The Israelites were like, yo Samuel, keep praying to the LORD our God for us, ask Him to rescue us from those Philistines. Don't stop praying 'cause we need Him to come through. #TeamIsrael"
1 Samuel,7,9,"So Samuel grabbed a cute little lamb and gave it as a sacrifice to the Lord. He prayed to the Lord on behalf of Israel, and guess what? The Lord totally listened to him!"
1 Samuel,7,10,"So, like, Samuel was doing his whole burnt offering thing, right? And then, outta nowhere, the Philistines were all like, 'Yo, let's battle Israel!' But then, the LORD, like, totally unleashed this mega thunderstorm on the Philistines that really messed them up. They totally got wrecked and were defeated by Israel."
1 Samuel,7,11,"So, like, the dudes from Israel left Mizpeh and totally chased after the Philistines and like, totally destroyed them, until they were all the way under Bethcar."
1 Samuel,7,12,"So Samuel grabbed a rock and placed it between Mizpeh and Shen, and named it Ebenezer, saying, 'Until now, God has been there for us.'"
1 Samuel,7,13,"So, like, the Philistines were totally defeated and they didn't bother the Israelites anymore: and you know what? God was totally against the Philistines for the whole time Samuel was around."
1 Samuel,7,14,"Yo, listen up! So, the cities that the Philistines had taken from Israel, they were totally given back to Israel. Like, from Ekron all the way to Gath - Israel got 'em back! And guess what? Israel totally kicked the Philistines' hands off their coastal areas. Boom! So, after all that, Israel and the Amorites were cool and there was mad peace between them. No drama, y'all!"
1 Samuel,7,15,And Samuel was the OG judge of Israel his whole life.
1 Samuel,7,16,"And he traveled from year to year, going around to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpeh, where he served as a judge over Israel in all those towns. {circuited: like, he totally traveled through}"
1 Samuel,7,17,"And he went back to Ramah, cuz that's where his crib was, and that's where he was the boss of Israel, and that's where he set up an altar for the LORD."
1 Samuel,8,1,"So, like, Samuel was getting up there in age, right? And he decided to appoint his sons as judges to rule over all of Israel, ya know?"
1 Samuel,8,2,"So this dude named his first kid Joel, and his second one Abiah. And get this, they were both like, big shots as judges in Beersheba."
1 Samuel,8,3,"But his sons didn't follow his example, they got caught up in the pursuit of money, accepting bribes, and distorting justice."
1 Samuel,8,4,So all the OGs of Israel gathered up and pulled up to Samuel in Ramah.
1 Samuel,8,5,"And they were like, dude, listen up, you're like ancient and your kids are not following in your path. So, we want you to hook us up with a king, just like all the other cool countries have, to lead and judge us."
1 Samuel,8,6,"But Samuel was not cool with it when they were like, 'We want a king to rule over us.' So Samuel hit up the Lord with a prayer."
1 Samuel,8,7,"So, the LORD was like, 'Yo, Samuel, listen up and pay attention to what the people are saying to you. It's not about you though, they're actually rejecting me and refusing to let me be their ruler.'"
1 Samuel,8,8,"Like, for real, since the day I rescued them from Egypt, they've been doing all kinds of stuff that straight up goes against me. They've totally ditched me and started worshiping these other gods, and they're totally gonna do the same thing to you, dude."
1 Samuel,8,9,"So listen up to what they're saying, but make sure you firmly express your thoughts to them and explain how the king will rule over them."
1 Samuel,8,10,"So, Samuel straight up spilled all the words of the LORD to the people who were like asking him for a king, you know?"
1 Samuel,8,11,"And he was like, yo, this is how the king's gonna roll when he's in charge: He's gonna scoop up your boys and put 'em on his team, ridin' in his dope chariots and bein' his horsemen. And there's even gonna be some homies runnin' ahead of his chariots. So that's how it's gonna go down, fam."
1 Samuel,8,12,"Then he'll choose leaders for thousands and leaders for fifties. They'll be in charge of farming his land, harvesting his crops, and constructing weapons and chariots."
1 Samuel,8,13,"And he's gonna hire your daughters as badass pastry chefs, master chefs, and expert bakers."
1 Samuel,8,14,"And he'll totally swipe your fields, vineyards, and oliveyards, picking out the juiciest ones, and handing them over to his crew."
1 Samuel,8,15,"And he's gonna take like 10% of all your crops and wine and give it to his squad, and like his crew, you know? 💸✨"
1 Samuel,8,16,"And he'll be like, taking all your servants, even, like, the coolest ones and the younger guys, and even your donkeys, and making them do his stuff."
1 Samuel,8,17,"He's gonna take a cut of your sheep - like, a solid tenth. And get this, you'll totally be his servants, like, doing his bidding and all. Crazy, right?"
1 Samuel,8,18,"And you're gonna be like, ugh, totally freaking out that day because of the king you all picked for yourselves, and seriously, God's not gonna listen to you on that day, just saying."
1 Samuel,8,19,"But the people were like, nah, not gonna listen to Samuel. They were all like, we want a king to rule over us, y'know?"
1 Samuel,8,20,"Bruh, let's just be like everybody else, ya know? We need a king to lead us, fight our battles, and be our hype man, always leading the charge on the front lines."
1 Samuel,8,21,So Samuel heard everything the people were saying and then told the Lord all about it.
1 Samuel,8,22,"Yo, Samuel, listen up! The Lord wants you to pay attention to what the peeps are saying and make 'em a king. So Samuel tells the squad from Israel to head back to their cities, yo!"
1 Samuel,9,1,"So, like, there was this dude from the tribe of Benjamin whose name was Kish. He was the son of Abiel, who was the son of Zeror, who was the son of Bechorath, who was the son of Aphiah. This Kish guy was, like, a total powerhouse, man. He had mad skills and was really influential, ya know?"
1 Samuel,9,2,"So this guy named Saul was really cool and good-looking. Like, seriously, there was no one better-looking than him among the people of Israel. He stood head and shoulders above everyone else!"
1 Samuel,9,3,"So, like, Kish, Saul's dad, lost his donkeys. And Kish was all like, 'Yo, Saul, grab one of our servants and, like, go find those donkeys.'"
1 Samuel,9,4,"So he went through mount Ephraim, and then through the land of Shalisha, but they couldn't find them. Then they went through the land of Shalim, and still couldn't find them. And he went through the land of the Benjamites, but they couldn't find them either."
1 Samuel,9,5,"So, like, once they arrived in Zuph, Saul was all like, hey servant dude, let's go back home. I mean, if we don't, my dad might stop worrying about the donkeys and start getting concerned about us."
1 Samuel,9,6,"Yo, listen up! There's this dope dude in the city, a man of God, you know? He's totally legit and everything he says comes true. So, we should definitely hit him up and see if he can guide us on the right path, ya feel me?"
1 Samuel,9,7,"So Saul asked his servant, like, dude, if we go, what are we gonna bring to the dude? 'Cause, like, we don't have any more bread, and we don't have a gift to give to the man of God. What do we have, bro? Like, seriously?"
1 Samuel,9,8,"Yo, so the servant replied to Saul like, check it, I got this small chunk of silver worth like a quarter of a shekel. I'm willing to give it to the man of God so he can guide us on our journey. It's right here in my hand, man."
1 Samuel,9,9,"Back in the day in Israel, when a dude wanted to ask God for some insights, he would say, 'Yo, let's go see the seer, because back then, a Prophet used to be known as a Seer.'"
1 Samuel,9,10,"Saul was like, 'Yo, good point, dude! Let's bounce.' So they rolled into the city where the man of God was at. 'Good thinking, bro,' Saul said. (That's like saying your words are on point.)"
1 Samuel,9,11,"As they were heading up the hill towards the city, they spotted some cool girls going out to get water and asked them, 'Is the seer here?'"
1 Samuel,9,12,"And they were like, yeah, he's totally here in front of you, like, hurry up, he just arrived in the city today. There's, like, a huge party happening today at the high place, you know, like a feast or sacrifice or something."
1 Samuel,9,13,"Once you enter the city, you'll find him right away before he goes up to the fancy restaurant. The people won't eat until he arrives because he's the one who gives thanks for the food. Then they can all dig in. So, go ahead and head up there, because at this point, you'll definitely find him. Today, to be specific."
1 Samuel,9,14,"And they entered the city, and as soon as they arrived, guess who showed up? Samuel came out to meet them, ready to go up to the high place."
1 Samuel,9,15,"So, like, the LORD whispered to Samuel the day before Saul showed up, and I mean, He straight up said..."
1 Samuel,9,16,"Yo, tomorrow at about this time, I'm gonna hook you up with a dude from Benjamin. You're gonna anoint him as the boss over my peeps in Israel, so he can save them from those Philistines. I've been peepin' my people, 'cause they've been cryin' out to me."
1 Samuel,9,17,"When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said to him, 'Look, this is the guy I told you about! He's gonna be in charge of my people, like, ruling and stuff.'"
1 Samuel,9,18,"So Saul goes up to Samuel at the gate and says, 'Yo, tell me, fam, where's the seer's crib at?'"
1 Samuel,9,19,"Samuel was like, 'Yo Saul, I'm the seer. Take the lead and go up to the high place. We'll chill and grub together today, and tomorrow I'll give you all the deets about what's on your mind.'"
1 Samuel,9,20,"Yo, don't stress about those missing donkeys from three days ago anymore, 'cause they've been found! And guess who everyone in Israel is stoked about? Yup, it's you and your whole fam, dude!"
1 Samuel,9,21,"Saul be like, yo, ain't I from Benjamin, the tiniest tribe of Israel? And my fam is the least of all the families in the tribe of Benjamin. So why you talkin' to me like that?"
1 Samuel,9,22,"So Samuel took Saul and his homie, brought them into the chill zone, and hooked them up with the top spot, surrounded by about 30 cool peeps."
1 Samuel,9,23,"Yo, cook! Bring me that food I gave you and put it right next to you like I told you."
1 Samuel,9,24,"Then the chef picked up the shoulder and everything on it and placed it in front of Saul. Samuel said, 'Look, there's still some left! Eat it, it's been saved for you ever since I told the people there would be a feast.' So Saul ate with Samuel that day."
1 Samuel,9,25,"And when they came down from the high place into the city, {Samuel} talked with Saul on the rooftop."
1 Samuel,9,26,"So, like, they woke up super early. And it was, like, still morning time when Samuel called Saul to go up on the roof, being all like, 'Yo, get up, I gotta send you off.' And Saul got up and they both left, like, outside and stuff."
1 Samuel,9,27,"So as they were heading towards the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, tell your buddy to go ahead of us (and he did), but you chill here for a bit, I gotta tell you what God's got to say."
1 Samuel,10,1,"So Samuel grabbed a bottle of oil and poured it on his head, then gave him a hug and said, 'Isn't it because the LORD chose you to lead his people?'"
1 Samuel,10,2,"Once you leave me today, head towards Rachel's tomb in the Benjamin region at Zelzah and you'll come across two dudes there. They'll tell you that the donkeys you were looking for have been found. And get this, your dad isn't even concerned about the donkeys anymore, he's worried sick about you! He's all like, 'What am I gonna do for my kid?'"
1 Samuel,10,3,"After that, keep moving and you'll reach the chill spot of Tabor. There, you'll run into three dudes heading up to Bethel to worship, one with three baby goats, another with three loaves of bread, and another with a bottle of wine."
1 Samuel,10,4,"And they'll be like, 'Hey, what's up?' and offer you two loaves of bread, which you'll totally accept from them. It's kinda like a friendly gesture, ya know?"
1 Samuel,10,5,"So, like, after you hit up the hill of God, you'll find the Philistine crew posted there. And when you roll into the city, you'll come across this group of prophets coming down from the high spot with their musical swag - they've got a psaltery, a tabret, a pipe, and a harp - and they're gonna drop some serious prophetic vibes, you know?"
1 Samuel,10,6,"And the LORD's spirit will totally come upon you, and you'll start prophesying with them, and you'll totally transform into a whole new person."
1 Samuel,10,7,"Yo, when you see all these signs go down, just do whatever you feel like doing, 'cause God's got your back. (And remember, these signs are gonna happen and you can do whatever feels right to you.)"
1 Samuel,10,8,"So, like, you gotta go to Gilgal first, and guess what? I'll join you later to make some lit burnt offerings and peace sacrifices. You gotta chill there for a week until I arrive and tell you what's up."
1 Samuel,10,9,"So, like, after he left Samuel, God totally transformed his heart, and all those crazy signs happened that day. The dude's back was like, shoulder or something, and God just flipped the switch and gave him a brand new heart, you know?"
1 Samuel,10,10,"So, like, when they got to the hill, guess what? There was this sick group of prophets waiting for him. And, BAM! The Spirit of God totally descended on him, and he started dropping some mad prophecies among them."
1 Samuel,10,11,"So, like, when people who knew Saul saw that he was suddenly prophesying along with the other prophets, they were like, 'Wait, hold up! Is Saul, the son of Kish, now one of the prophets too?'"
1 Samuel,10,12,"Then this person from there responded and was like, wait, who's their dad though? And that's how the saying started, like, is Saul like, a prophet too or what? #deepthoughts"
1 Samuel,10,13,"And once he was done with his prophecy, he headed over to the lit spot."
1 Samuel,10,14,"Saul's uncle asked him and his servant, 'Where y'all goin'?' And he was like, 'Lookin' for the donkeys. When we realized they were nowhere to be found, we went to Samuel.'"
1 Samuel,10,15,"Yo, Saul's uncle be like, spill the tea and tell me what Samuel told ya."
1 Samuel,10,16,"So Saul was like, dude, he straight up told us that the donkeys were found. But when it came to what Samuel said about being king, he didn't mention a word of it."
1 Samuel,10,17,"So Samuel gathered all the people and said, 'Yo, let's meet up with the big man upstairs in Mizpeh.'"
1 Samuel,10,18,"And God was like, 'Yo, Israelites, listen up. Here's what the LORD God of Israel has to say: I totally rescued you from Egypt, saved you from the Egyptians, and freed you from the grip of all those mean kingdoms that were oppressing you."
1 Samuel,10,19,"And like, listen up, you guys messed up big time. You straight up rejected your God, who legit saved you from all the tough stuff you went through. And guess what? You straight up told Him, 'Nah, we want a king instead.' So, here's what you need to do: gather up all your squads, your tribes, and your squads within those tribes, and be ready to face the LORD."
1 Samuel,10,20,"So, like, Samuel gathered all the peeps from the tribes of Israel, and, bam, it was the tribe of Benjamin that got chosen."
1 Samuel,10,21,"So, when the peeps in charge gathered up the tribe of Benjamin, they figured out that Matri's crew was the one. And guess who they found? Saul, Kish's son! But hold up, when they went searching for him, dude was nowhere to be found."
1 Samuel,10,22,"So, like, they were like asking the LORD, you know, if the dude was gonna show up there. And the LORD, like, straight up answered, like, 'Yo, check it, he's hiding among the stuff.'"
1 Samuel,10,23,"So they quickly went and brought him over, and when he stood there in the midst of everyone, he was towering above everyone else from his shoulders and up."
1 Samuel,10,24,"Samuel was like, yo guys, check out the one the LORD has chosen. No one else is as awesome as him! Everyone went wild and shouted, 'Long live the king!'}"
1 Samuel,10,25,"And Samuel was like, 'Yo guys, here's the deal with the kingdom,' and he wrote it all down in a book and put it in front of the LORD. Then Samuel was like, Peacee out, everyone! Go back to your own cribs.'"
1 Samuel,10,26,"And Saul was like, 'I'm heading back to Gibeah, yo!' And he had these homies with him, you know, a crew of dudes whose hearts God had totally touched."
1 Samuel,10,27,"But those wicked people said, 'How can this guy rescue us?' And they looked down on him and didn't bring him any gifts. But he stayed quiet, as if he couldn't hear them."
1 Samuel,11,1,"So there was this guy called Nahash the Ammonite, and he rolls up to Jabeshgilead with his crew, ready to take 'em down. But the people of Jabesh are like, 'Hold up! Let's make a deal, Nahash. We'll serve you if you make a pact with us.'"
1 Samuel,11,2,"And Nahash, the Ammonite, was like, 'Yo! Here's the deal - I'll make a pact with you, but first, you gotta let me gouge out all your right eyes. Then, I'll use it to shame all of Israel, straight up.'"
1 Samuel,11,3,"So, like, the oldies from Jabesh were like, 'Yo, hold up for seven days, okay? We need to send out messages to everyone in Israel and see if anyone can help us out. If no one comes to rescue us, then we'll come join you.'"
1 Samuel,11,4,"So, these messengers pulled up to Gibeah of Saul and spilled the tea to the people. And let me tell you, everyone just lost it and started bawling their eyes out."
1 Samuel,11,5,"Yo, check it out, Saul came back from the fields with the livestock and he's like, 'Yo, why are the people crying?' And they filled him in on what went down with the folks from Jabesh."
1 Samuel,11,6,"When Saul found out what happened, he felt the Spirit of God rushing through him and he got super triggered."
1 Samuel,11,7,"So, like, he got a couple of oxen and totally cut them into pieces. Then he had messengers send the pieces all over Israel. And he was like, 'Yo, whoever doesn't come join Saul and Samuel, their oxen are gonna get the same treatment.' That's when everyone got super scared of the Lord and they all came out together, totally united."
1 Samuel,11,8,"So, like, when the dude counted all the peeps in Bezek, there were, like, 300k Israelites and, ya know, 30k dudes from Judah."
1 Samuel,11,9,"And they told the messengers, like yo, go tell the dudes in Jabeshgilead, tomorrow when the sun's blazing, you gonna get some backup, yo. So the messengers went and shared the message with the guys in Jabesh, and they were stoked, man. (help: or, deliverance)"
1 Samuel,11,10,"So the guys from Jabesh were like, 'Tomorrow we'll come out and you can do whatever you think is cool with us.'"
1 Samuel,11,11,"So the next day, Saul divided his people into three groups. They sneaked into the enemy's camp early in the morning and fought the Ammonites until it got super hot. By the end, the Ammonites were totally scattered, and only two of them were left standing."
1 Samuel,11,12,"Then the people were like, 'Yo, Samuel, who's the one saying Saul should be our king? Get those dudes here so we can straight up execute them.'"
1 Samuel,11,13,"And Saul was like, no one's getting executed today because the Lord totally came through for Israel and saved us!"
1 Samuel,11,14,"So Samuel said to the squad, Yo, let's bounce to Gilgal and straight-up revamp the kingdom over there."
1 Samuel,11,15,"Then everyone gathered at Gilgal, and they crowned Saul as king before the LORD. They offered sacrifices of peace offerings to the LORD, and Saul and all the dudes of Israel were super stoked about it."
1 Samuel,12,1,"Yo, listen up! Samuel was like, 'Guys, I totally heard you out and did exactly what you asked. I went ahead and crowned a king for y'all!'"
1 Samuel,12,2,"Yo, check it out, the king is totally in your sight: and hey, I'm older and got that gray hair thing going on; and guess what, my sons are here too along with you: and I've been doing my thing in front of you ever since I was a kid up until now."
1 Samuel,12,3,"Yo, listen up! I swear before God and His chosen leader: Have I stolen anyone's stuff? Have I scammed anyone or treated them unfairly? Have I taken bribes to look the other way? If I have, I promise to make things right. No shady business here, I got you!"
1 Samuel,12,4,"And they were like, 'Yo, you didn't scam us or treat us unfairly, nor did you take anything from anyone's stash.'"
1 Samuel,12,5,"And he was like, yo, the LORD totally knows it, and his chosen one is also aware, that you can't find anything sketchy on me. And they were like, for real, he's totally got the receipts."
1 Samuel,12,6,"Samuel was like, 'Hey fam, it was the LORD who totally raised up Moses and Aaron and led your ancestors out of Egypt.'"
1 Samuel,12,7,"So like, pause for a sec and let me have a chat with you about all the awesome things the LORD has done for you and your ancestors, in a totally righteous way, before the LORD himself. #blessed"
1 Samuel,12,8,"When Jacob arrived in Egypt and your parents cried out to the LORD, the LORD sent Moses and Aaron to rescue your parents from Egypt and settle them in this spot."
1 Samuel,12,9,"But when they totally spaced out on their dude upstairs, he let them get wrecked by Sisera, the big boss of Hazor's crew, and by the Philistines, and the king of Moab - these guys all came at them with everything they had."
1 Samuel,12,10,"So they called out to the LORD and said, 'We messed up, man, 'cause we totally ditched the LORD and started worshipping Baalim and Ashtaroth. But now, please save us from our enemies, and we promise to be loyal to you.'"
1 Samuel,12,11,"So, God was like, 'Yo, Jerubbaal, Bedan, Jephthah, and Samuel - go kick some enemy butt and save my peeps on all fronts.' And you know what? You all ended up chillin' in a safe zone, free from your enemies' clutches."
1 Samuel,12,12,"So, when you peeps noticed that Nahash, the king of the Ammonites, was coming at you, you were like, 'Nuh-uh, we want a king to rule over us, 'cause back in the day, when the Lord your God was the one in charge."
1 Samuel,12,13,"So, check it out, guys! The king you've been so hyped about and totally wanted? Well, guess what? The Lord went ahead and made him your king."
1 Samuel,12,14,"If y'all show mad respect to the Big Man upstairs, serve Him, and do what He says without rebelling, then both y'all and the boss in charge will keep rocking with the LORD your God: commandmentt: like, what He says) (continue...: basically like, sticking with)"
1 Samuel,12,15,"But if you refuse to listen to the LORD and rebel against His commandments, then the LORD will oppose you, just like He did to your ancestors."
1 Samuel,12,16,"So, like, stand up and witness this epic thing that the LORD is gonna do right in front of you."
1 Samuel,12,17,"Isn't it the time for wheat harvest today? I'm gonna hit up the big man upstairs, and he's gonna send some sick thunder and rain. Just so y'all can realize and see how messed up your wickedness is, all the sketchy stuff you pulled asking for a king."
1 Samuel,12,18,"So Samuel hit up the Big Guy; and the Big Guy sent some sick thunder and rain that day: and everyone was like, super shook by the Big Guy and Samuel."
1 Samuel,12,19,"So, like, everyone was telling Samuel, 'Dude, could you like, pray to the LORD your God for us, man? We don't wanna die, you know? We messed up big time by asking for a king, like, that was totally not cool.'"
1 Samuel,12,20,"And Samuel was like, yo people, chillax: you guys messed up big time, but don't bounce from following the LORD, instead stay loyal to the LORD with all your heart;"
1 Samuel,12,21,"And don't get distracted by useless stuff, because you'll end up chasing after things that don't bring any benefit or deliverance. They're just empty and pointless."
1 Samuel,12,22,"Yo, the Lord ain't ever gonna ditch His peeps 'cause He's all about that reputation, ya know? He straight up stoked to have you as His chosen crew!"
1 Samuel,12,23,"But like, seriously, I would never even think about disrespecting the Lord by not praying for you. But don't worry, I got you covered. I'll help you out and show you the right path, you know?"
1 Samuel,12,24,"Just have mad respect for the LORD and straight up serve Him with all your heart, for real. Think about all the dope stuff He's done for you, like seriously, it's crazy impressive."
1 Samuel,12,25,"But if y'all keep on doing wrong stuff, all y'all and your king gonna face some serious consequences."
1 Samuel,13,1,"So like, Saul was king for a year, and then he ruled over Israel for two more years. It's like, he was totally in charge and stuff, you know?"
1 Samuel,13,2,"Saul was like, yo, I'm picking three thousand of Israel's finest. Two thousand went with Saul to Michmash and mount Bethel, while Jonathan led a squad of a thousand in Gibeah of Benjamin. Then Saul sent the rest of the people to chill at their own tents."
1 Samuel,13,3,"So Jonathan totally destroyed the Philistines who were hanging out in Geba, and when the word got out, Saul announced it to everyone by blowing a sick trumpet. He was like, 'Yo, all you Hebrews better listen up!'"
1 Samuel,13,4,"So, like, everyone in Israel heard that Saul totally wrecked a bunch of Philistines and that the Philistines were like super mad at Israel too. And then all the people gathered at Gilgal to support Saul. It was, like, a big deal, you know?"
1 Samuel,13,5,"So, like, the Philistines, they all got together to like, totally fight against Israel. They had, get this, thirty thousand chariots, six thousand horsemen, and a ton of people, like seriously, as many as the sand on the beach. And they set up camp in Michmash, to the east of Bethaven, you know?"
1 Samuel,13,6,"When the guys from Israel peeped their situation and realized it was tight (cuz everyone was freaked out), the people straight up dipped and hid themselves in caves, thick bushes, rocky spots, high-up places, and even pits."
1 Samuel,13,7,"So, like, some of the Hebrews crossed over this place called Jordan to get to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was still in Gilgal and his whole squad was straight up shook and following him. (And by 'following', I mean they were trembling, ya know?)"
1 Samuel,13,8,"So he waited for a whole week, just like Samuel said, but Samuel didn't show up in Gilgal. And everybody started to go their own way, leaving him alone."
1 Samuel,13,9,"So Saul was like, 'Yo, bring me a burnt offering and peace offerings.' And he went ahead and offered the burnt offering."
1 Samuel,13,10,"So, like, right after he finished offering the burnt offering, guess what? Samuel showed up and Saul went out to meet him, you know, to say what's up and show some respect. (Salute, by the way, means bless in Hebrew)"
1 Samuel,13,11,"Samuel was like, 'Dude, what did you do?' And Saul was all like, 'Well, I noticed that everyone was ditching me and you didn't show up on time, plus the Philistines were joining forces at Michmash."
1 Samuel,13,12,"So basically, I realized that the Philistines were heading towards Gilgal and I hadn't even prayed to the LORD yet. I felt like I had to do something, so I pushed myself and decided to make a burnt offering. You know, like ask for help from the big guy upstairs. It's all about seeking His face or His favor, you know what I mean?"
1 Samuel,13,13,"Yo, Samuel straight up telling Saul, bro, you messed up big time. You totally didn't follow the command from the LORD your God, man. If you had, God would've totally hooked you up with an everlasting kingdom for Israel. That's a major bummer, dude."
1 Samuel,13,14,"But, like, your kingdom is about to end, dude. The big man upstairs, like, found himself a dude who totally vibes with Him, know what I mean? He's giving this dude the title of captain over His people because you haven't been doing what the big man told you to do."
1 Samuel,13,15,"So Samuel got up and left Gilgal to go to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul counted the number of guys who were hanging out with him, about 600 bros."
1 Samuel,13,16,"So Saul, Jonathan, and their squad stayed in Gibeah of Benjamin, while the Philistines set up camp in Michmash."
1 Samuel,13,17,"Then the haters came out from the camp of the Philistines in three groups: one group went towards Ophrah, to the land of Shual:"
1 Samuel,13,18,"Then some other group went towards Bethhoron, and another group went towards the border that overlooks the valley of Zeboim, facing the wilderness."
1 Samuel,13,19,"So, like, there were no blacksmiths in the whole land of Israel, 'cause the Philistines were all like, 'Nah, we can't let the Hebrews create any weapons like swords or spears, you know?'"
1 Samuel,13,20,"But yo, all the Israelites rolled up to the Philistines to flex their tools, sharpenin' their own share, coulter, axe, and mattock."
1 Samuel,13,21,"But they had a whole collection of tools for their work: mattocks, coulters, forks, axes, and even goads that they sharpened. The goads were like a file with multiple sharp edges or a pim, equivalent to a third of a shekel."
1 Samuel,13,22,"So, when the epic battle went down, no one, I mean NO ONE, had a sword or spear, except for Saul and his son Jonathan. They were the only ones who came prepared."
1 Samuel,13,23,So the Philistine squad decided to head towards the Michmash area. (garrison: also known as the standing camp)
1 Samuel,14,1,"So one day, Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to his armor bearer, 'Hey, let's sneak over to the Philistines' hideout on the other side.' But he didn't tell his dad about it."
1 Samuel,14,2,So Saul hung out in the farthest part of Gibeah under this cool pomegranate tree in Migron. And he had around six hundred homies rollin' with him.
1 Samuel,14,3,"And Ahiah, who is Ahitub's son, Ichabod's bro, Phinehas' grandson, and Eli's great-grandson, was the priest of the LORD in Shiloh, flexing his ephod. And peeps didn't even realize that Jonathan had dipped. {Ahiah, also known as Ahimelech}"
1 Samuel,14,4,"So like, there were these totally tough rocks on either side of the passage that Jonathan was trying to sneak through to get to the Philistines' place. One rock was called Bozez, and the other was named Seneh."
1 Samuel,14,5,"One was positioned to the north near Michmash, while the other was to the south near Gibeah. (Note: In the original Hebrew, the word 'forefront' can also mean 'tooth'.)"
1 Samuel,14,6,"So Jonathan turned to the dude holding his swag armor and was like, 'Yo, let's roll up to those uncircumcised dudes at the garrison. Maybe the big man upstairs will work his magic for us, no cap. The Lord doesn't need a massive squad to save us, he can handle it with just a few of us.'"
1 Samuel,14,7,"And his sidekick was like, 'Do whatever you want, man. I got your back. I'm here for you, just like you want.'"
1 Samuel,14,8,"So Jonathan said, yo, check it out, we gonna roll up to those dudes and let 'em see who we really are."
1 Samuel,14,9,"If they're like, 'Yo, just chill here and we'll come to you,' then we're gonna stay right where we are and not go up to them."
1 Samuel,14,10,"But like, if they're like, 'Come at us, bro,' then we'll be like, 'Let's do this!' 'Cause, you know, the Lord totally handed them over to us. And that's gonna be, like, our sign, ya know?"
1 Samuel,14,11,"So, like, the two of them were spotted by the Philistines' crew, and the Philistines were all like, 'Yo, check it out, those Hebrew peeps are coming out of their hiding spots and stuff!'"
1 Samuel,14,12,"So, like, Jonathan and his buddy with the sick armor were talking to the guys from the enemy camp, and they're all like, 'Yo, come up here and we're gonna show you something cool!' And Jonathan was like, 'Bro, come with me. God totally handed them over to us, dude!'"
1 Samuel,14,13,"So, Jonathan straight up Spider-Manned his way, crawling on his hands and feet, with his trusty sidekick armorbearer right behind him. They totally owned the enemy, with Jonathan taking them down first, and then his armorbearer finishing them off."
1 Samuel,14,14,"So, like, Jonathan and his bro went ahead and straight up owned about 20 dudes in this tiny piece of land, yo! It's like, you could fit half a freaking football field in there. Just imagine, it's the area where a couple of oxen could break some ground. Pretty gnarly, right?!"
1 Samuel,14,15,"And everyone was shook - the soldiers, the scouts, and the people. They all trembled in fear as the ground quaked with an intense shudder. It was like, super intense, y'know. A real divine level trembling, straight from God."
1 Samuel,14,16,"So, the guards of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin were, like, watching, right? And, oh my gosh, they saw that the whole crowd was like disappearing, and they, like, just started attacking each other!"
1 Samuel,14,17,"So, Saul was like, 'Yo, people! Count and see who's missing.' And after they counted, they found out that Jonathan and his homie with the armor weren't there, man."
1 Samuel,14,18,"Saul was like, 'Yo Ahiah, bring that God's ark over here. It's with the Israel fam right now.'"
1 Samuel,14,19,"While Saul was chatting with the priest, the chaotic commotion in the Philistine camp kept going and getting louder. Saul told the priest, 'Hold up, stop what you're doing.'"
1 Samuel,14,20,"So Saul and all his homies gathered up and rolled into battle. And yo, everyone ended up turning on each other, like bruh, it was straight chaos up in there. It was a major L, no cap."
1 Samuel,14,21,"Also, the Hebrews who were chilling with the Philistines before, they decided to join the Israelites under Saul and Jonathan. They were like, 'Nah, we're team Israel now!'"
1 Samuel,14,22,"And just like all the dudes from Israel who were hiding out in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines bounced, they straight up chased after them in the fight."
1 Samuel,14,23,"And like, the LORD totally came through for Israel that day, ya know? And the battle like, totally shifted over to Bethaven."
1 Samuel,14,24,"And the dudes of Israel were so bummed out that day: 'cause Saul, he swore to the peeps, like, 'Dude, if any of you eat anything until evening, you're totally cursed. I gotta get revenge on my enemies!' So, like, no one even had a bite to eat, man."
1 Samuel,14,25,And all the people in the land went to a grove; and there was honey on the ground.
1 Samuel,14,26,"So when the squad entered the forest, yo, they saw honey just drippin', but none of them dared to taste it, 'cause they were spooked by that solemn promise they made."
1 Samuel,14,27,"But Jonathan totally missed it when his dad made everyone swear an oath. So he took the rod in his hand and dipped it into a honeycomb. Then he put his hand to his mouth, and suddenly he felt so awake and alert."
1 Samuel,14,28,"Then this person from the crew spoke up and said, 'Dude, your dad was dead serious when he made everyone swear not to eat anything today. Any guy who dares to munch on some grub is in deep trouble.' And let me tell you, the people were totally exhausted and starving."
1 Samuel,14,29,"So Jonathan was like, 'Yo, my dad totally messed up the land, but check it out, my eyes are lit now cuz I had a sweet taste of this honey.'"
1 Samuel,14,30,"Bruh, imagine if the squad just went all out and feasted on the loot they took from their enemies today. Like, seriously, there would've been way more havoc unleashed on the Philistines, no cap."
1 Samuel,14,31,"So, like, they totally beat up the Philistines that day, from Michmash to Aijalon, and the people were, like, super exhausted."
1 Samuel,14,32,"So the people totally went for the loot and grabbed some sheep, oxen, and calves, and straight up killed 'em on the ground. And then they just went ahead and ate 'em, like, with the blood and all."
1 Samuel,14,33,"So, they came to Saul and were like, 'Dude, the people are totally sinning against the LORD by eating meat with blood in it.' And Saul was like, 'Wow, you guys really messed up. Bring me a big ol' stone right now.'"
1 Samuel,14,34,"So Saul was like, guys, go and spread out among the people, and tell them to grab their own cows and sheep and slaughter them here and have a feast. But yo, don't mess up and go against the LORD by eating the meat with blood. And all the people brought their own cows that night and killed them right then and there."
1 Samuel,14,35,"So Saul was like, yo, I gotta show some love to the LORD, and he straight up built an altar. This was the very first time he did that to honor the LORD, you know what I'm sayin'? Like, that was the start of it all, ya feel me?"
1 Samuel,14,36,"So, Saul was like, 'Hey, let's sneak up on the Philistines tonight and raid them until morning. We can't let any of them escape!' And everyone was like, 'Sure, do whatever you think is best.' Then the priest was like, 'Let's come closer to God and seek His guidance.'"
1 Samuel,14,37,"So Saul was like, yo God, should I chase after the Philistines? Can we get the victory, fam? But God didn't answer him that day. Dang."
1 Samuel,14,38,"Yo, listen up y'all, Saul called all the big shots over here! Let's find out what went down and where this sin went down today, you feel me? {chief: Hebrew for corners}"
1 Samuel,14,39,"Swear on God, the one who saves Israel, that even if it's Jonathan my son, he's gonna die for sure. But no one from the whole crowd had the guts to respond."
1 Samuel,14,40,"So Saul told all the peeps of Israel, 'Y'all stand over there, while me and my son Jonathan chill on this side.' And the people were like, Saull, whatever you think is lit, we got your back.'"
1 Samuel,14,41,"So Saul was like, 'Yo, God of Israel, can you give us a sign to find out who's innocent?' And Saul and Jonathan were chosen, but the rest of the people were like, 'Nah, we out.'"
1 Samuel,14,42,"So Saul was like, let's flip a coin to decide between me and my son Jonathan. And guess what? Jonathan was the chosen one!"
1 Samuel,14,43,"So Saul was like, 'Yo Jonathan, spill the beans. What did you do?' And Jonathan was like, 'Well, I just had a tiny bit of honey with the rod I was holding, and now it's like I'm toast, fam.'"
1 Samuel,14,44,"Saul was like, OMG, you're gonna die, Jonathan! May God seriously punish you even harder! 😱"
1 Samuel,14,45,"And the people were like, bro, are you seriously gonna let Jonathan die? He literally saved our whole nation! No way, man! I swear to the Almighty, not a single strand of his hair will touch the ground! He totally had God on his side today. So the people stepped in and made sure Jonathan didn't bite the dust."
1 Samuel,14,46,"So Saul dipped from chasing the Philistines, and the Philistines dipped back to their spot."
1 Samuel,14,47,"So Saul totally took over the kingdom of Israel and like, straight up battled against all his enemies from every direction. He went head to head with Moab, the kids from Ammon, and Edom, as well as the kings of Zobah and the Philistines. I'm telling you, wherever he went, he really gave them a hard time."
1 Samuel,14,48,"So, he got all his squad together and totally wrecked the Amalekites, saving Israel from those jerks who were trying to mess them up. #teamwork #victory"
1 Samuel,14,49,"Saul had three sons: Jonathan, Ishui, and Melchishua. He also had two daughters named Merab (the oldest) and Michal (the youngest)."
1 Samuel,14,50,"Saul's wifey's name was Ahinoam, daughter of Ahimaaz. The boss of his squad was Abner, Ner's son, who happened to be Saul's uncle. (Abner, you know: Hebrew name Abiner)"
1 Samuel,14,51,"So, Kish was the OG dad of Saul, and Abner's pops was Ner, who happened to be Abiel's son."
1 Samuel,14,52,"There was, like, a total war going on against the Philistines during Saul's reign. And whenever Saul spotted a rad dude with mad strength or awesome combat skills, he'd totally bring him into his crew."
1 Samuel,15,1,"So, like, Samuel told Saul, 'Yo, the LORD was all like, 'I want you to be king over his people in Israel.' So, you better listen up and pay attention to what the LORD is saying, ya know?'"
1 Samuel,15,2,"Yo, listen up! The big guy upstairs, the LORD of all, he's like, totally remembering what Amalek did to Israel. You know, how he like, totally ambushed them on their way back from Egypt? Yeah, that's what's up."
1 Samuel,15,3,"Go out and totally wreck Amalek, like, completely obliterate everything they own. Don't hold back, seriously, wipe out every living thing - men, women, babies, even their farm animals. Everything gotta go, no mercy!"
1 Samuel,15,4,So Saul called everyone to gather in Telaim and counted them - we had 200K foot soldiers and 10K dudes repping Judah.
1 Samuel,15,5,So Saul arrived at this city called Amalek and set up camp in the valley.
1 Samuel,15,6,"Saul was like, 'Hey Kenites, y'all gotta bounce from the Amalekites ASAP, unless you wanna get wiped out with them. I mean, you were actually pretty cool to all the Israelites back when they left Egypt. So yeah, the Kenites were like Peacee out' and dipped from the Amalekites."
1 Samuel,15,7,"So Saul totally wrecked the Amalekites from Havilah all the way to Shur, which is like right across from Egypt."
1 Samuel,15,8,"So, like, this dude captured Agag, the Amalekite king, and totally wiped out everyone with his sword, no survivors."
1 Samuel,15,9,"So, like, Saul and the people were like, 'Nah, let's not totally wipe out Agag and all the good stuff - the sheep, the oxen, the fatlings, and the lambs.' They only destroyed the gross and worthless stuff. You know, the second sort."
1 Samuel,15,10,"So, like, God started talking to Samuel and was all like,"
1 Samuel,15,11,I'm lowkey bummed I made Saul king because he straight up changed his mind and stopped following me. He didn't even do what I told him to do. Samuel was super upset about it and cried out to the LORD all night.
1 Samuel,15,12,"So, like, when Samuel woke up super early to meet Saul in the morning, word came to Samuel that Saul went to Carmel and, yo, he like found a spot and then just like journeyed around and went down to Gilgal."
1 Samuel,15,13,"So Samuel went to Saul and Saul said to him, 'Dude, you're totally blessed by the LORD. I totally nailed carrying out the LORD's command.'"
1 Samuel,15,14,"Samuel was like, 'Yo, why am I hearing all this sheep noise and cows mooing? What's the dealio with that?'"
1 Samuel,15,15,"Saul was like, 'Yo, they brought back the sheep and oxen taken from the Amalekites. They wanted to sacrifice the best ones to honor the LORD your God, but we totally wiped out the rest."
1 Samuel,15,16,"So, Samuel was like, 'Yo, Saul, hold up for a sec. I gotta spill what the LORD told me tonight.' And Saul's just like, 'Alright, go on, spill it.'"
1 Samuel,15,17,"And Samuel was like, yo, remember when you used to think you were small and insignificant? But like, look at you now - leading the tribes of Israel and being anointed as king by the LORD. Crazy, right?"
1 Samuel,15,18,"So, like, the LORD was all like, 'Yo, I'm sending you on a mission. Go and totally wipe out those Amalekite sinners. Fight against them until there's nothing left of 'em.'"
1 Samuel,15,19,"Why didn't you listen to the LORD, but just went after the loot and did something bad in the LORD's eyes?"
1 Samuel,15,20,"So Saul told Samuel like, 'Yeah bro, I totally followed what the LORD said. I did everything He told me to do. I went exactly where He sent me and brought back Agag, the king of Amalek. And you know what? I totally wiped out the whole Amalekite crew.'"
1 Samuel,15,21,"But the people snagged some stuff, like sheep and oxen, the top-tier loot that was supposed to be totally wrecked, to offer as sacrifices to the LORD your God in Gilgal."
1 Samuel,15,22,"Samuel was like, does God really care about burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as He cares about us just obeying Him? Seriously, being obedient is way more important to God than any fancy sacrifices or offerings."
1 Samuel,15,23,"Being rebellious is basically like doing witchcraft, and being stubborn is like committing sin and idolatry. Since you've straight-up rejected the word of the LORD, He's rejected you from being king as well. (divination: Hebrew for witchcraft)"
1 Samuel,15,24,"Saul was like, 'Yo, Samuel, I messed up big time! I totally went against what the LORD and you told me to do, all because I was scared of what other people would think. I caved in and followed their demands.'"
1 Samuel,15,25,"So like, please forgive me, and come back with me so we can worship the LORD."
1 Samuel,15,26,"So, Samuel's like, 'Nah, man, I'm not rollin' with you anymore. Cuz let me tell ya, you totally dissed the LORD's word, and now the big man upstairs is done with you being the king of Israel.'"
1 Samuel,15,27,"And as Samuel was about to leave, he grabbed the edge of his cloak and it tore."
1 Samuel,15,28,"Samuel was like, yo, God just snatched the kingdom of Israel away from you and gave it to someone else who's way cooler than you, dude."
1 Samuel,15,29,"And the Strength of Israel won't ever back out or change his mind: because he's not like us, he's not some dude who regrets. {Strength: or, Eternity, or, Victory}"
1 Samuel,15,30,"And he's like, I messed up, bro. Can you, like, do me a solid and show me some respect in front of the older peeps and the whole nation of Israel? Also, join me in going back so I can worship your God, man."
1 Samuel,15,31,"So Samuel went back to Saul, and Saul showed reverence to the LORD."
1 Samuel,15,32,"Samuel was like, 'Yo, bring Agag, the king of the Amalekites, to me.' So Agag came all fancy-like. And Agag was like, 'Bruh, I'm so over the whole fear of death thing.'"
1 Samuel,15,33,"So, like, Samuel was all like, 'Dude, since you made women lose their kids with your sword, your own mom won't have any kids either.' And then Samuel straight up cut Agag into pieces in front of the LORD in Gilgal."
1 Samuel,15,34,"So Samuel bounced to Ramah, and Saul headed home to Gibeah of Saul."
1 Samuel,15,35,"And Samuel never saw Saul again until the day he died. But Samuel felt really sad for Saul, and God regretted making Saul the king of Israel."
1 Samuel,16,1,"And God was like, 'Samuel, why are you still moping around because of Saul? I already said he's not gonna be king anymore. Get yourself together, grab some oil, and go to Jesse from Bethlehem. I've picked one of his sons to be the next king, so go check them out.'"
1 Samuel,16,2,"Samuel was like, how can I even go? If Saul finds out, he'll straight up end me. But then the LORD was like, just take a cow with you and say you're going to make a sacrifice to Him. Easy peasy."
1 Samuel,16,3,"And hit up Jesse to the sesh, and I'll show you what's up: you gotta bless the one I choose with that anointing."
1 Samuel,16,4,"So, Samuel did exactly what the LORD said and went to Bethlehem. When the town elders saw him, they got all jittery and asked, 'Yo, you here for peace or what?' (Btw, 'coming' actually means 'meeting' in Hebrew.)"
1 Samuel,16,5,"And he was like, 'Yo, chillax. I'm here to make a sacrifice to the LORD, so you all better get yourselves ready and roll with me to the sacrifice.' So he made Jesse and his sons all holy and brought them along to the sacrifice."
1 Samuel,16,6,"So, when they showed up, he checked out Eliab and was like, for sure, this is the one that the LORD has chosen. (Eliab is also called Elihu, just FYI.)"
1 Samuel,16,7,"But God was like, 'Yo, Samuel, don't judge by his looks or how tall he is, 'cause I've already rejected him. People may only care about what's on the outside, but I see what's in the heart, and that's what matters to me.'"
1 Samuel,16,8,"So Jesse called Abinadab over and had him go in front of Samuel. And he was like, 'Nah, the LORD didn't pick this dude.'"
1 Samuel,16,9,"So Jesse had Shammah come forward, but the LORD didn't choose him. (Shammah was also known as Shimeah or Shimma.)"
1 Samuel,16,10,"So, Jesse lined up all seven of his sons for Samuel to see. Then Samuel was like, 'Yo, the LORD ain't picking any of these dudes.'"
1 Samuel,16,11,"Samuel was like, 'Yo, Jesse, you got any more kids?' Jesse was like, 'Yeah, the youngest one out there, he's just chillin' with the sheep.' Samuel was like, 'Go get him real quick, we ain't about to start the party until he shows up.'"
1 Samuel,16,12,"So he sent for him and brought him in. And let me tell you, this guy had that great combo of being good-looking and having a nice face. The LORD was like, 'Yo, get up and anoint him, because this is the one.'"
1 Samuel,16,13,"So Samuel grabbed a bottle of oil and poured it on David in front of his bros, and from that moment on, the Spirit of the LORD became all up in David. Then Samuel bounced and headed to Ramah."
1 Samuel,16,14,"Then, like, the LORD's Spirit totally ditched Saul, and this, like, super wicked spirit from the LORD started messing with him. It was, like, hella terrifying, you know?"
1 Samuel,16,15,"Yo, Saul's homies were like, 'Yo, man! Check it out, there's like this wicked spirit bugging you, straight from the Big Guy upstairs!'"
1 Samuel,16,16,"Yo, dude, our lord should totally tell his peeps to find a sick musician who can rock the harp. Trust, when you start feeling that bad vibe from the Big Guy, this musician will start jamming and you'll feel hella better."
1 Samuel,16,17,"So Saul was like, yo, servants, find me a talented dude who can play some sick tunes and bring him to me."
1 Samuel,16,18,"Yo, one of the servants spoke up and was like, 'Check it, I saw this guy Jesse's son from Bethlehem. He's a total pro at playing music, a brave warrior, strategic in battles, smart with his words, good-looking, and you know what? The Lord's got his back, man.'"
1 Samuel,16,19,"So Saul DM'd Jesse like, 'Hey, send me your son David, he's still doing his sheep gig.'"
1 Samuel,16,20,"So Jesse packed up a donkey loaded with bread, a bottle of wine, and a young goat and sent them with David, his son, to Saul."
1 Samuel,16,21,"So David went up to Saul, and stood before him. And they totally clicked, like, Saul was super into David. And David ended up becoming Saul's personal armor dude."
1 Samuel,16,22,"Saul hit up Jesse like, yo, tell David to come through and chill with me 'cause I'm vibin' with him heavy."
1 Samuel,16,23,"So, like, there was this time when Saul was all troubled because of this spirit from God, right? And then David, being the genius that he is, whipped out his harp and started playing with mad skills. It totally worked, bro! Saul instantly felt better, the evil spirit bounced and left him alone. Talk about a power move!"
1 Samuel,17,1,"So, like, the Philistines got all their squads together to go into battle and they met up at Shochoh, which is part of Judah. They set up camp between Shochoh and Azekah, near Ephesdammim. (Ephesdammim is like this place by the coast called Dammim, also known as Pasdammim. Seriously!)"
1 Samuel,17,2,"So Saul and the gang of Israel got together, and set up camp near the cool valley of Elah, ready to face off against the Philistines. #BattleModeOn #DavidvsGoliath"
1 Samuel,17,3,"So, like, the Philistines were chilling on this mountain, right? And Israel was on the other mountain, no cap. And there was this valley in between them, you know what I mean?"
1 Samuel,17,4,"Yo, there was this straight-up legend coming out of the Philistines' camp, goes by the name Goliath from Gath. This dude was tall AF, standing at six cubits and a span."
1 Samuel,17,5,"He had a sick brass helmet on his head and he was totally decked out in a sick chainmail suit. The suit weighed a ton, like five thousand shekels of brass! Yeet!"
1 Samuel,17,6,"He rocked some sick brass leg armor and had a dope brass shield on his back. (or, gorget)"
1 Samuel,17,7,"His spear was massive, like a giant knitting needle, and the tip of it weighed six hundred shekels of iron. And he had someone with a shield leading the way for him."
1 Samuel,17,8,"And he straight up yells at the Israelite crew, like, 'Why you all up in arms and ready for a showdown? Ain't I a Philistine? And y'all just followers of Saul? Pick one of your own dudes and send him my way, I dare you.'"
1 Samuel,17,9,"If he can actually take me in a fight and beat me, then we'll be your servants. But if I come out on top and kick his butt, then you'll be our servants, and you better serve us well."
1 Samuel,17,10,"So, the Philistine was like, 'Yo, I dare the Israelite armies to send someone out here to fight me, one-on-one.'"
1 Samuel,17,11,"When Saul and all of Israel heard what the Philistine said, it totally freaked them out and made them hella scared."
1 Samuel,17,12,"So, there was this guy named David, who was Jesse's son from Bethlehemjudah, which is pretty cool. David had eight brothers, and he was known around town as an old man during Saul's reign."
1 Samuel,17,13,"So, like, Jesse's three oldest sons, you know, they went and joined Saul in the battle. The sons' names? The firstborn was Eliab, then it was Abinadab, and the third one was Shammah."
1 Samuel,17,14,"And David was like the baby of the group, and the three oldest dudes hung out with Saul."
1 Samuel,17,15,But David dipped and yeeted from Saul to flex on feeding his dad's sheep at Bethlehem.
1 Samuel,17,16,"So, like, this Philistine guy kept showing up every morning and evening for a whole 40 days, you know?"
1 Samuel,17,17,"So, Jesse was like, 'Yo David, grab an ephah of this fire roasted corn and ten loaves for your homies, then bounce to the camp and hook 'em up.'"
1 Samuel,17,18,"And bring these ten bomb cheeses to the squad leader of their crew, and see how your homies are doing, and get their signed promise. [cheeses: like, super fresh milk cheeses] [of...: like, the leader of a thousand]"
1 Samuel,17,19,"So, like, Saul and his crew, and all the dudes from Israel, were chilling in the valley of Elah, battling it out with the Philistines."
1 Samuel,17,20,"So, David woke up super early in the morning and entrusted his sheep to a caretaker. He did exactly as Jesse had told him, heading towards the battlefield where the army was getting ready for action. And let me tell you, he was beyond pumped for the fight!"
1 Samuel,17,21,"So Israel and the Philistines were all geared up for a serious showdown, with armies lining up to face each other."
1 Samuel,17,22,"So David ditched his ride with the keeper and ditched into the army, then went and gave daps to his bros. {his ride: referring to his belongings} {gave daps: meaning greeted warmly}"
1 Samuel,17,23,"So, like, they were all chatting, and then this super strong dude from the Philistine army, this guy called Goliath from Gath, showed up and started saying the same stuff. And then David, like, heard everything he was saying."
1 Samuel,17,24,"When the guys in Israel peeped the dude, they were shook and dipped real quick. I mean, they were terrified AF. (Like, his presence could literally make you wet your pants.)"
1 Samuel,17,25,"Yo, did y'all peep this dude who just rolled up? He's straight up tryna diss Israel! Word is, whoever takes him down, the king gonna hook 'em up big time. Talkin' mad cash, his daughter's hand in marriage, and freedom for his whole fam in Israel."
1 Samuel,17,26,"And David was like, guys, listen up! What's the game plan for the dude who takes down this Philistine and totally saves Israel's reputation? I mean, who does this uncircumcised Philistine think he is, trying to mess with the armies of our all-powerful God?"
1 Samuel,17,27,"And the peeps were like, 'That's totally what's gonna happen to anyone who takes him out!'"
1 Samuel,17,28,"So, like, Eliab, the oldest bro, totally overheard David talking to the guys. And let me tell you, Eliab was SO mad at David. He's all like, 'Why'd you even come here? Who's taking care of those lame sheep in the wilderness? I'm onto you, man. I know you're just here to check out the battle and show off your arrogance and bad attitude.'"
1 Samuel,17,29,"And David was like, yo, what did I do this time? Like, isn't there a legit reason for all this?"
1 Samuel,17,30,"Then he left and approached someone else, speaking in the same way. And the people responded to him just like before."
1 Samuel,17,31,"And when people heard what David said, they repeated it to Saul, and he called for David to come to him."
1 Samuel,17,32,"Yo, Saul, don't stress out about this Philistine, I got you! Your boy David's stepping up to the plate, ready to throw down in a fight."
1 Samuel,17,33,"So, like, Saul said to David, bro, you legit can't take on this Philistine and fight him 'cause, let's be real, you're just a youngin', and he's been a total warrior since forever."
1 Samuel,17,34,"So David was like, Yo Saul, listen up, your boy was just minding his own business, takin' care of his dad's sheep, when outta nowhere, a freakin' lion and a bear showed up and snatched one of the lambs from the flock. A lamb is like a baby sheep, BTW. Just sayin'. Oh, and in case you were wonderin', 'kid' can also mean a young goat. Just keepin' you in the loop, fam."
1 Samuel,17,35,"So, I chased after him, gave him a good whack, and rescued what he had snatched. And when he tried to attack me again, I grabbed his beard and whacked him once more, and bam, he was no more."
1 Samuel,17,36,"I totally took down the lion and the bear, and this Philistine dude who hasn't even been circumcised is gonna be just like them. He's been disrespecting the armies of the Almighty God."
1 Samuel,17,37,"David was like, yo, the LORD who saved me from a freakin' lion and bear is gonna save me from this Philistine dude too. And Saul was like, alright David, go do your thing, may the LORD be with you."
1 Samuel,17,38,"So, Saul hooked David up with his dope gear – he slapped a sick brass helmet on his head and decked him out with a fresh coat of mail. #Swaggy"
1 Samuel,17,39,"So David put on his sword and armor, and he wanted to go. But he couldn't do it because he hadn't tried them out yet. David told Saul, 'No way, this won't work for me. I need to test them out first.' And then David took them off."
1 Samuel,17,40,"So, like, he grabbed his staff and picked out five totally rad smooth stones from the brook and stashed them in his shepherd's bag, you know, like a bag for shepherds; and he had his sling in his other hand too. Then, he approached the Philistine, ready to take him down. (Brook means like a valley and bag means, like, a vessel in Hebrew.)"
1 Samuel,17,41,And the Philistine moved forward and came closer to David; and the guy with the shield was in front of him.
1 Samuel,17,42,"And when the Philistine peeped, and spotted David, he straight up dissed him: 'cause he was just a young dude, kinda reddish, with a good-looking face."
1 Samuel,17,43,"And the Philistine was like, 'Bro, am I some lowly dog, that you gotta come at me with sticks? Man, the Philistine straight up started cursing David with his gods.'"
1 Samuel,17,44,"The Philistine was all like, 'Yo David, come at me bro! I'm gonna let the birds and wild animals feast on your flesh!'"
1 Samuel,17,45,"So David was like, 'Bro, you roll up on me with a sword, a spear, and a shield? Respect. But lemme tell ya, I roll up on you reppin' the Almighty, the God of Israel's armies, whom you straight up disrespected.'"
1 Samuel,17,46,"Today, the LORD will hand you over to me. I'll defeat you and take your head. And I'll let the corpses of the Philistine army be devoured by birds in the sky and wild animals on the ground. This way, everyone will know that there's a God in Israel. (Note: 'deliver' means 'shut you up' in Hebrew.)"
1 Samuel,17,47,"And like, listen up everyone, just so you know, the LORD doesn't save using some old school sword and spear, okay? 'Cause the battle totally belongs to the LORD and he's totally gonna deliver you into our hands."
1 Samuel,17,48,"So, like, when the Philistine got up and started approaching David, David was all like, 'Oh snap!' and totally sprinted towards the enemy's army to confront the Philistine."
1 Samuel,17,49,"And David reached into his bag, grabbed a stone, and threw it at the Philistine. He hit him right in the forehead, and the stone sank into his forehead. The Philistine fell face-first onto the ground."
1 Samuel,17,50,"David totally owned the Philistine by using a sling and a stone, he hit the Philistine and killed him. But, no swords were in David's hand."
1 Samuel,17,51,"So David sprinted up to the Philistine, grabbed his sword, pulled it out of its cover, and defeated him by cutting off his head. When the Philistines witnessed their brave warrior's demise, they got scared and ran away."
1 Samuel,17,52,"So, like, the dudes from Israel and Judah got up and totally started screaming and chasing after the Philistines, all the way to the valley and the gates of Ekron. And, like, the injured Philistines were just dropping like flies along the way to Shaaraim, even all the way to Gath and Ekron, man."
1 Samuel,17,53,"So, the Israelites came back from chasing the Philistines, and they totally raided their tents, yo!"
1 Samuel,17,54,"So David grabbed the head of the Philistine dude and brought it back to Jerusalem, but he stashed his armor in his tent."
1 Samuel,17,55,"And Saul was like, totally amazed when he saw David stepping up to take on the Philistine. He was like, 'Yo, Abner, the captain of the squad, who's this kid?' And Abner was like, 'I swear, my king, I have no idea.'"
1 Samuel,17,56,"And the king was like, yo, find out whose son that young dude is."
1 Samuel,17,57,"So, picture this: David comes back from totally owning the Philistine dude, right? And then Abner, this total boss, grabs him and brings him to Saul while he's holding the Philistine's head like, 'Check this out!'"
1 Samuel,17,58,"Saul was like, yo dude, whose spawn are you, bro? And David was all like, I'm the son of Jesse, your homie from Bethlehem, man."
1 Samuel,18,1,"And, like, after Saul finished speaking, Jonathan's soul was totally connected with David's soul and he loved him, like, as much as his own soul."
1 Samuel,18,2,"And Saul grabbed him that day, and wouldn't let him leave his father's house anymore."
1 Samuel,18,3,"So, Jonathan and David were tight and they made a pact, 'cause they loved each other like soulmates and shiz."
1 Samuel,18,4,"So Jonathan took off his robe, and he gave it to David along with his clothes, his sword, his bow, and his belt."
1 Samuel,18,5,"So, David basically did whatever Saul told him to do and he was actually pretty smart about it. Saul was impressed by David's skills and made him the leader of his army. Not only that, but David gained respect from everyone, including Saul's own servants."
1 Samuel,18,6,"So, like, when David came back after totally slaying the Philistine, all the ladies from different cities in Israel came out to welcome King Saul. They were singing, dancing, jamming on their tabrets, spreading joy, and playing those three-stringed instruments and stuff. How awesome is that?"
1 Samuel,18,7,"While they were jamming, the ladies started spinnin' and said, Saull be takin' down thousands, but David be slayin' tens of thousands.'"
1 Samuel,18,8,"Saul got super mad when he heard what people were saying. He was like, 'They're giving David way more credit than me! They're saying he's got tens of thousands, and I've only got thousands. What else could he want besides the kingdom?'"
1 Samuel,18,9,And Saul was lowkey checking out David from that day on.
1 Samuel,18,10,"The next day, Saul was hanging out in the house when an evil spirit from God showed up and made him start prophesying. Meanwhile, David was jamming on his instrument like he usually did. Little did he know, Saul had a javelin in his hand."
1 Samuel,18,11,"Then Saul yeeted the javelin 'cause he was like, I'm gonna totally hit David all the way to the wall! But David skillfully dodged it not once, but twice. #ninja"
1 Samuel,18,12,"Saul was shook of David, 'cause the LORD was on his side while ghosting Saul."
1 Samuel,18,13,"So Saul was like, 'You're outta here!' and then he was like, 'But you can be in charge of a thousand people now.' And then that dude went out and did his thing, leading the people."
1 Samuel,18,14,"David was low-key smart in everything he did, and God was totally vibing with him. #Blessed"
1 Samuel,18,15,"So when Saul realized that this guy was actually pretty smart, he got scared of him."
1 Samuel,18,16,"But, like, all of Israel and Judah were totally vibing with David, 'cause he was, like, always there for them, doing his thing and being all cool."
1 Samuel,18,17,"So Saul said to David, check it out, I've got this older daughter Merab, and I'll give her to you to marry. Just show some guts for me and fight the battles for the LORD. Saul was like, I don't wanna be the one to try and hurt you, let the Philistines handle that"
1 Samuel,18,18,"And David was like, bro, who even am I? And seriously, why should I, or my family, be like connected with the king as son-in-law? Like, why me, man?"
1 Samuel,18,19,"So, like, when it was time for Merab, Saul's daughter, to marry David, she ended up marrying Adriel the Meholathite instead."
1 Samuel,18,20,"So, like, Michal, Saul's daughter, totally had a major crush on David. And, you know, people went ahead and spilled the tea to Saul, and he was totally cool with it. Like, he thought it was all good and stuff. #approved"
1 Samuel,18,21,"So Saul was like, 'Yo, I'll hook him up with her, to make sure she messes him up and gets him in trouble with the Philistines.' Then Saul tells David, 'Bro, you gonna be my son-in-law, no doubt.'"
1 Samuel,18,22,"So Saul told his homies, like, talk to David in private and be like, yo, the king is so stoked on you and all his crew vouch for you, bro. So, like, you should totally become the king's son-in-law, ya feel?"
1 Samuel,18,23,"So Saul's crew went and told David what was up. And David was like, 'You really think it's cool for me to become a king's son-in-law? I mean, I'm just a nobody, not exactly living the high life.'"
1 Samuel,18,24,"So Saul's squad was like, 'Yo, David said this, bro'. {On...: In other words, it went down exactly like David said}"
1 Samuel,18,25,"And Saul was like, yo, tell David the king's not after no money or anything, but he wants a sweet revenge on those Philistines. He's like, bring me a hundred Philistine foreskins to show he means business. But low-key, Saul was schemin', tryna get David messed up by the Philistines."
1 Samuel,18,26,"And when David's homies told him what went down, he was stoked to become the king's son-in-law, and it wasn't even time yet. (Expired means fulfilled, btw)"
1 Samuel,18,27,"So, David got up and went with his squad, and they took out around two hundred Philistine dudes. And David brought their foreskins and counted them all out for the king, as proof that he was worthy of becoming the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him his daughter Michal to be his wife."
1 Samuel,18,28,"Saul peeped the scene and realized that the LORD was vibing with David, and that Michal, Saul's daughter, was totally into him."
1 Samuel,18,29,"Saul was totally shook by David, like, majorly afraid! And Saul's hatred for David just kept growing, like an endless vendetta."
1 Samuel,18,30,"So, the top dudes from the Philistines rolled out, and you won't believe it, but after they dipped, David totally outsmarted all of Saul's crew. He became such a legend that everyone thought he was straight-up precious."
1 Samuel,19,1,"So, like, Saul, he talked to Jonathan, his son, and all his peeps who served him, and he was like, 'Yo, let's take out David, man."
1 Samuel,19,2,"But Jonathan, Saul's son, was really stoked about David. He let David know that Saul, my dad, wants to kill you. So, like, be super careful and stay hidden until morning in a secret spot."
1 Samuel,19,3,"And I'll pull up next to my dad in the field where you're at, and we'll have a chat about you; and whatever I see, I'll spill the deets to you."
1 Samuel,19,4,"So Jonathan was like, yo Saul, David is a good dude, don't do him dirty. He hasn't done anything wrong to you and he's been hella good to you."
1 Samuel,19,5,"Dude went all-in, risking his life to take down that Philistine warrior. And let me tell you, the Lord totally saved Israel big time! You were there, witnessing the epic victory and probably felt super stoked! So why would you even think about committing such a terrible sin by unjustly trying to kill David?"
1 Samuel,19,6,"And Saul, like, totally listened to Jonathan, and Saul swore, swearing by the Lord, that he, like, won't kill him. Pinky promise, you know?"
1 Samuel,19,7,"So Jonathan hit up David and showed him all the tea. Then Jonathan brought David to Saul, and they chilled together like old times. #nostalgic"
1 Samuel,19,8,"So there was another epic battle: and David went out and totally wrecked the Philistines, slaying them left and right. They couldn't handle his unstoppable power and ran away scared."
1 Samuel,19,9,"So Saul was chilling in his crib, holding a javelin, when an evil spirit from the LORD came upon him. Meanwhile, David was like flexing his musical skills."
1 Samuel,19,10,"So Saul was like, totally trying to throw a javelin at David, hoping to hit him against the wall and stuff. But David managed to slip away and, epic move, he launched that javelin right into the wall. Then David made a speedy getaway and escaped in the cover of night."
1 Samuel,19,11,"Saul totally sent some peeps to David's crib to keep an eye on him and straight up kill him in the AM. And Michal, David's wifey, spilled the tea and warned him like, 'If you don't get yourself outta here tonight, you're gonna get smoked tomorrow.'"
1 Samuel,19,12,"So, like, Michal totally helped David escape through, like, a window and stuff. And, he, like, ran away and managed to escape the situation."
1 Samuel,19,13,"So, Michal grabbed a picture and placed it on the bed. She also used a pillow made of goat hair as a cushion and covered it with a cloth. (teraphim means image in Hebrew)"
1 Samuel,19,14,"When Saul sent some DMs to capture David, she was like, 'Nah, he's just not feeling well.'"
1 Samuel,19,15,"So Saul sent the messengers once more to find David, and he said, 'Bring him to me in bed, so I can get rid of him.'"
1 Samuel,19,16,"And when the messengers arrived, yo, check it out, there was an image chillin' on the bed, all cozy with a pillow made of goats' hair as its cushion."
1 Samuel,19,17,"Then Saul was like, dude, why did you trick me and let my enemy escape? And Michal was like, well, he asked me to let him go, why should I kill you?"
1 Samuel,19,18,"So David was like, 'Yo, I'm outta here!' and he dipped, making a quick getaway to Samuel's crib in Ramah. He spilled all the tea about what Saul had been doing to him. And then, David and Samuel decided to shack up in Naioth."
1 Samuel,19,19,"So, like, someone told Saul, they're like, 'Yo dude, guess what? David is chilling at Naioth in Ramah.'"
1 Samuel,19,20,"So Saul DM'ed some peeps to snatch David, but when they saw the prophets doing their prophesy thing and Samuel being their leader, the Holy Spirit hit up Saul's peeps and they started prophesying too."
1 Samuel,19,21,"And when Saul heard about it, he sent more messengers, and they started prophesying too. Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also started prophesying."
1 Samuel,19,22,"Then he also went to Ramah and arrived at a dope spot in Sechu. And he asked, 'Yo, where can I find Samuel and David?' And someone be like, 'Yo, they chillin' at Naioth in Ramah.'"
1 Samuel,19,23,"Then he went to Naioth in Ramah, and the Spirit of God was with him too. He kept on going and started prophesying, all the way to Naioth in Ramah."
1 Samuel,19,24,"So he took off all his clothes and started prophesying in front of Samuel, just like the others. He even stayed naked for the whole day and night. That's why people started wondering, 'Is Saul now a prophet too?'"
1 Samuel,20,1,"So David dipped from Naioth in Ramah and went up to Jonathan, like yo bro, what's the deal? How did I mess up? Like what did I do to your dad that he's after my life?"
1 Samuel,20,2,"And he was like, oh no way, you are definitely not gonna die! Like seriously, my dad doesn't do anything without telling me first, big or small. So why would he keep something like this from me? That's just not how he rolls. No secrets here, man!"
1 Samuel,20,3,"And David was like, yo, for real, your dad knows I'm chillin' in your eyes. But he's all like, don't let Jonathan know 'cause it'll bum him out. But swear to God, or like, your own soul, man, I'm this close to dying."
1 Samuel,20,4,"Yo, bro, Jonathan told David, like, whatever you want, I got your back. Just tell me what's on your mind, and I'll make it happen, ya know?"
1 Samuel,20,5,"So David was like, 'Yo Jonathan, listen up. Tomorrow's the new moon and I gotta be at the king's feast. But I need to dip and hide in the field until the evening of the third day.'"
1 Samuel,20,6,"If your dad asks about me, just let him know that David really wanted me to come with him to Bethlehem, to celebrate the annual family gathering. It's a big event, you know!"
1 Samuel,20,7,"If he's like, 'Yeah, everything's cool, no worries,' then we're all good and I can chill. But if he's like, super angry, then you know he's about to bring some serious bad vibes."
1 Samuel,20,8,"So like, be chill and show some kindness to your servant, 'cause you and I are in this covenant thing with the LORD together. If, like, I've done anything wrong, then, you know, take care of it yourself instead of dragging me to your father. Why make things more complicated, right?"
1 Samuel,20,9,"And Jonathan was like, no way! If I knew for sure that my dad had some evil plan to mess you up, I swear I'd spill the tea and give you the heads up!"
1 Samuel,20,10,"So David was like, yo Jonathan, who's gonna spill the tea? Like, what if your dad acts all extra when you ask him?"
1 Samuel,20,11,"Jonathan was like, 'Yo David, let's dip and chill in the field.' So they both bounced and went to the field together."
1 Samuel,20,12,"And Jonathan was like, yo, God of Israel, when I talk to my pops tomorrow or the day after, and if he's cool with you, I'll hit you up and let you know, no cap."
1 Samuel,20,13,"May God bless Jonathan abundantly and even more. But if my dad wants to harm you, I'll let you know and help you escape so you can be safe. May God be by your side, just like He was with my dad. Let me give you the inside scoop and support you."
1 Samuel,20,14,"And don't just be cool to me while I'm alive, show me that sweet kindness from the Lord, so I won't kick the bucket:"
1 Samuel,20,15,"But like, don't you ever stop showing love to my fam, even when the big man upstairs wipes out all of David's enemies on this planet."
1 Samuel,20,16,"So Jonathan and David became besties and they made a pact, like a total bro code, where Jonathan was like, 'Dude, if anything happens to me, may God punish my enemies through you, my bro.'"
1 Samuel,20,17,"And Jonathan made David promise once more, because he was his bestie: because he loved him just as much as he loved himself. {because...: or, by his love toward him}"
1 Samuel,20,18,"Yo, David, listen up. Jonathan just told me that tomorrow is the new moon, and you know what that means? Your absence is gonna be noticed, bro. Your seat's gonna be empty, and people are gonna be wondering where you at."
1 Samuel,20,19,"Once you've waited for three days, head down without wasting time and go back to the spot where you hid during the important event. Stick around by the stone Ezel. (Quickly: or you can say diligently: Hebrew: greatly) (When the...: Hebrew: on the day of the event) (Ezel: or the one that shows the way)"
1 Samuel,20,20,"And I'll totally fire off like three arrows on one side, like I'm aiming at a target or something."
1 Samuel,20,21,"Yo, listen up! I'm gonna send a dude to fetch the arrows. If I straight up tell the guy, 'Look, the arrows are right next to you, grab 'em,' then you best believe you should come back here quick. It's all good, no harm will come your way, I swear to the LORD."
1 Samuel,20,22,"But if I tell the dude, Yo, check it out, the arrows are way past you. Peace out, 'cause the LORD sent you off."
1 Samuel,20,23,"And regarding the issue we discussed, you should know that the Lord will always be with both of us, now and forever."
1 Samuel,20,24,"So David totally dipped into the field and when the new moon vibes arrived, the king chilled and grubbed on some bomb food."
1 Samuel,20,25,"So, like, the king was chillin' on his throne, you know, like he always does, sittin' next to the wall. Jonathan got up and Abner sat next to Saul, but David's spot was totally empty."
1 Samuel,20,26,"But Saul didn't say anything that day because he thought, something's gone wrong with him, he's not chill, definitely not chill."
1 Samuel,20,27,"The next day, which was the second day of the month, David was not there, and Saul asked his son Jonathan, 'Why isn't Jesse's son here for dinner, neither yesterday nor today?'"
1 Samuel,20,28,"So, Saul hit up Jonathan and David was like, 'Yo, can I bounce to Bethlehem?'}"
1 Samuel,20,29,"And he was like, yo, can I bounce real quick? My fam is throwin' down a lit sacrifice in the city, and my bro straight up told me I gotta be there. So, if you're cool with it, can I dip out and kick it with my homies? That's why I ain't showin' up to the king's table."
1 Samuel,20,30,"Saul got really mad at Jonathan and said, 'Dude, you're such a troublemaker! I totally know that you're secretly supporting Jesse's son, and it's making things awkward for you and your fam. You can't hide it!'"
1 Samuel,20,31,"As long as Jesse's son is alive, you won't have any power or a kingdom to call your own. So hurry up and bring him to me, because he's definitely gonna bite the dust. (BTW, he's practically a ticking time bomb!)"
1 Samuel,20,32,"So, like, Jonathan was all like, 'Dude, why do you want to kill him? What did he even do?'"
1 Samuel,20,33,"So, like, Saul, full-on chucked a javelin at David to, like, attack him. And Jonathan totally knew that his dad was like, dead set on killing David."
1 Samuel,20,34,"So Jonathan was like, super pissed and he didn't eat any food on the second day of the month 'cause he was hella upset about what his dad did to David and how he embarrassed him."
1 Samuel,20,35,"So in the morning, Jonathan met up with David in the field like they planned, and there was also a young kid with them."
1 Samuel,20,36,"And he was like, 'Yo, dude, go fetch the arrows I'm about to shoot.' And while the dude was running, my guy shot an arrow that went way past him."
1 Samuel,20,37,"When the guy reached the spot where the arrow shot by Jonathan had landed, Jonathan called out to the guy and asked, 'Isn't the arrow past you?'"
1 Samuel,20,38,"And Jonathan shouted to the dude, like, 'Quick, go fast, don't stop!' And Jonathan's dude collected the arrows and went back to his boss."
1 Samuel,20,39,But the dude had no clue what was going on: only Jonathan and David were in on it.
1 Samuel,20,40,"So Jonathan handed over his weapons to his homie and said, 'Yo, take these to the city.'"
1 Samuel,20,41,"Once the dude left, David got up from his spot in the south and fell flat on his face on the ground. He gave three respectful bows, then they hugged each other and cried together, until David cried the most."
1 Samuel,20,42,"And Jonathan was like, 'Yo David, peace out, we made a serious commitment to the Lord. We promised that God would always be there for us and our descendants.'"
1 Samuel,20,43,"So he got up and left, and Jonathan went into the city."
1 Samuel,21,1,"So David went to Nob, where Ahimelech the priest was. Ahimelech got scared when he saw David and asked him, 'Why are you all by yourself? Where are your squad?' (FYI, Ahimelech is also known as Ahiah)"
1 Samuel,21,2,"So David was like, yo Ahimelech the priest, the king told me to do some secret mission and I can't tell anyone what it's all about or where I'm going. Also, I've already sent my squad to a specific spot."
1 Samuel,21,3,"So, like, what do you have with you right now? Can you hook me up with five loaves of bread? Or like, whatever you have on you at the moment. Found, you know?"
1 Samuel,21,4,"So the priest was like, 'Bro, I don't have regular bread here, just this holy bread. But it's only cool for you to have if your squad hasn't been getting busy with the ladies.'"
1 Samuel,21,5,"Ayo, the priest asked David what's up, and David was like, 'No cap, bro, we haven't been chillin' with any ladies for like three days now. Ever since I left, the homies have been on some holy vibe, and the bread is just regular, you know? Even if it was made sacred just now, it's all good.'"
1 Samuel,21,6,"So the priest hooked him up with that blessed bread cuz there was no other bread around, just the holy bread that was taken from the presence of the LORD. They swapped it with some fresh bread once it was taken away."
1 Samuel,21,7,"So this dude, one of Saul's servants, was at the spot on that day, hangin' out with the LORD. His name was Doeg, an Edomite, the top dog among Saul's herdsmen."
1 Samuel,21,8,"So David was like, yo Ahimelech, you got like a spare spear or sword around? I totally forgot to bring mine 'cause I was in a rush, doing some urgent stuff for the king."
1 Samuel,21,9,"The priest was like, 'Yo, check it out, David! I got Goliath the Philistine's sword right here, man! Remember when you totally took him out in the valley of Elah? Well, this bad boy's all wrapped up nice and cozy behind the ephod. If you want it, it's all yours. There ain't no other sword like this, bro.' And David was like, 'No way, dude! Nothing else compares to this. Hook me up with that sword, please.'"
1 Samuel,21,10,"So David was like, 'Nah, I'm outta here!' and he bounced because he was scared of Saul. He ended up going to Achish, the king of Gath."
1 Samuel,21,11,"So like, Achish's crew was like, 'Yo, isn't this David, the king of the whole place? Haven't we all heard the hype about him slayin' thousands, while Saul only got his hands dirty with a measly ten grand?'"
1 Samuel,21,12,"So David took these words to heart and got really scared of Achish, the king of Gath."
1 Samuel,21,13,"And dude was like, totally acting all crazy in front of them, pretending to be mad, and scratching on the doors of the gate, even letting his saliva drip down on his beard. Like, he was making some serious marks, you know?"
1 Samuel,21,14,"Achish was like, 'Yo, fam, do you see this guy acting cray cray? Why'd you bring him to me?'}"
1 Samuel,21,15,Do I really need these crazy people that you've brought here to act all insane in front of me? Are you seriously suggesting that I should let this person come into my house?
1 Samuel,22,1,"So David bounced from there and made a quick getaway to this super cool cave called Adullam. And guess what? When his bros and his whole fam found out about it, they were like, 'Dude, let's go chill with him down there.'"
1 Samuel,22,2,"And all those who were struggling, in debt, or feeling dissatisfied, came together to join him. He became their leader, and he had around four hundred men with him. (Debt here means owing someone money, and discontented means feeling deeply upset.)"
1 Samuel,22,3,"So David bounced over to Mizpeh of Moab and he was like, 'Yo king of Moab, can you do me a solid and let my parents crash with you for a bit? I need to figure out what God's plan is gonna be for me.'"
1 Samuel,22,4,"And he brought them to the king of Moab, and they chilled with him the whole time David was in the fortress."
1 Samuel,22,5,"So, like, this prophet dude named Gad tells David, 'Dude, don't just chill in this place. Go yeah, head over to Judah.' And you know what? David's like, 'Alrighty then,' and he bounces to this forest called Hareth."
1 Samuel,22,6,"When Saul found out that David and his crew were found, Saul was chilling in Gibeah, posted up under a tree in Ramah. Homeboy had his spear in his hand, and all his homies were surrounding him, you know?"
1 Samuel,22,7,"So, Saul turns to his crew and says, 'Listen up, peeps from Benjamin! Do you really think that Jesse's kid is gonna hook y'all up with some sweet plots of land and vineyards, and make every one of you big shots leading thousands and hundreds?'"
1 Samuel,22,8,"Yo, like seriously, all y'all be plotting against me, and not a single one of you has informed me that my own son is in cahoots with Jesse's son. And to make it worse, none of you even have the decency to feel bad for me or give me a heads up that my son has roused my servant to turn against me and scheme behind my back. Can't someone just spill the tea and let me know what's really going on here?"
1 Samuel,22,9,"So Doeg the Edomite, who was in charge of Saul's servants, responded saying, 'Yo, I peeped Jesse's kid rollin' up to Nob to see Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub.'"
1 Samuel,22,10,"So he asked the LORD about it, and gave him some food, and handed him Goliath the Philistine's sword."
1 Samuel,22,11,"So the king hit up Ahimelech the priest, who's the son of Ahitub, and all his homies from his dad's crib, the priests in Nob. And they all showed up to chill with the king."
1 Samuel,22,12,"Saul was like, yo, listen up, you son of Ahitub. And the dude was like, yup, I'm here, my lord. (Yeah, he really said 'behold me' 😉)"
1 Samuel,22,13,"Saul was like, 'Dude, why are you and Jesse's son conspiring against me? You gave him food, a weapon, and even asked God for him, so he could go against me and plot against me today? Like, what's up with that?"
1 Samuel,22,14,"And Ahimelech was like, yo king, nobody could be as loyal as David, dude. He's like, the king's son-in-law and he does whatever you say, and he's super respected in the kingdom, man."
1 Samuel,22,15,"Like, did I even ask God about this guy? No way, dude! Don't even think of blaming me, the king, or anyone in my family for any of this. I seriously had no clue about any of it, whether it was a big deal or not. Seriously."
1 Samuel,22,16,"And the king was like, 'You're totally gonna die, Ahimelech, seriously, you and your entire fam.'"
1 Samuel,22,17,"Then the king told his squad to attack and take out the priests of the LORD because they were on David's side and knew about his escape, but didn't tell me. But the king's crew refused to go after the priests of the LORD."
1 Samuel,22,18,"Then the king was like, 'Yo, Doeg, go and attack the priests, fam.' So Doeg the Edomite turns around and straight up goes for it, taking down eighty-five people who were rockin' those fresh linen clothes, ya know?"
1 Samuel,22,19,"Then he totally destroyed Nob, the city where the priests lived. He went all out, not holding back, and used his sword to attack men, women, children, babies, and even the livestock like oxen, donkeys, and sheep. Absolutely no mercy given."
1 Samuel,22,20,"So Ahimelech's son, Abiathar, managed to escape and run away to join David."
1 Samuel,22,21,Abiathar told David that Saul totally wiped out the priests of the LORD.
1 Samuel,22,22,"And David was like, yo Abiathar, I totally knew back then when Doeg the Edomite was around that he would snitch to Saul. I lowkey caused the deaths of everyone in your dad's fam."
1 Samuel,22,23,"Yo, stick with me, don't stress: anyone after me is after you too, but as long as you're with me, you're protected."
1 Samuel,23,1,"So, like, someone comes up to David and they're all like, 'Dude, guess what? The Philistines are totally attacking Keilah and stealing all the grain!'"
1 Samuel,23,2,"So David hit up the LORD and was like, 'Yo, should I go and wreck these Philistines?' And the LORD was all, 'Yeah, go ahead and wreck 'em, and save Keilah while you're at it.'"
1 Samuel,23,3,"Yo, David's crew was like, dude, we're straight up scared chillin' here in Judah. Imagine how much worse it'll be if we roll up to Keilah to face off against those Philistine armies, yo?"
1 Samuel,23,4,"So David asked the LORD once more. And the LORD replied, 'Get up, head over to Keilah, because I will hand over the Philistines to you.'"
1 Samuel,23,5,"So David and his squad rolled up to Keilah, straight up throwing hands with the Philistines, raiding their livestock, and straight up wiping them out. David totally came through and saved the crew in Keilah."
1 Samuel,23,6,"So, like, Abiathar, Ahimelech's son, he made a mad dash to David in Keilah, and guess what? He had this sick ephod in his hand, fam."
1 Samuel,23,7,"So Saul found out that David came to Keilah. And Saul was like, God totally handed him over to me! He's trapped, hiding in this town with gates and bars."
1 Samuel,23,8,"So Saul gathered everyone for battle, heading to Keilah to trap David and his crew."
1 Samuel,23,9,"And David found out that Saul was lowkey plotting against him; so he told Abiathar the priest, yo bring me the ephod, ASAP."
1 Samuel,23,10,"Yo, David was like, 'Sup, LORD, God of Israel! Your boy over here heard that Saul's planning to roll up to Keilah and wreck the whole city just to get at me, like, seriously?!"
1 Samuel,23,11,"Bruh, are those Keilah dudes gonna snitch on me and hand me over to Saul? Is Saul really gonna roll up like I've been hearing? Yo, LORD God of Israel, I'm begging you, fill me in. And the LORD said, Yeah, he's gonna come down."
1 Samuel,23,12,"So David was like, yo, are the people of Keilah gonna sell me and my squad out to Saul? And the LORD was like, yeah, they totally gonna do it. 🙅‍♂️🤷‍♂️"
1 Samuel,23,13,"So David and his squad, about six hundred of them, bounced out of Keilah and went wherever they could. Word got to Saul that David had dipped from Keilah, and he decided not to chase him down."
1 Samuel,23,14,"So David was out in the wild, chilling in some fortified spots, posted up on a mountain in the Ziph wilderness. And you know what? Saul was on his tail, searching for him every frickin' day. But God didn't let Saul catch him, straight up."
1 Samuel,23,15,"So David peeped that Saul was out here, tryna take him down: and David was low-key chillin' in the middle of nowhere, camping in the woods."
1 Samuel,23,16,"Then Jonathan, the son of Saul, got up and went to David in the forest, encouraging and empowering him in his faith in God."
1 Samuel,23,17,"And he was like, don't worry, bro: Saul my dad ain't gonna catch you. You gonna become the king of Israel, and I'm gonna be right there by your side. Even my dad Saul knows it."
1 Samuel,23,18,"And these two bros, like, made a pact before the LORD: David stayed chill in the woods, while Jonathan bounced to his crib."
1 Samuel,23,19,"So, like, the Ziphites went to Saul in Gibeah and they were all like, 'Psst, dude, isn't David chillin' with us in these rad hideouts in the woods, on that lit hill called Hachilah, on the south side of Jeshimon? You know, that place in the wilderness and all.'"
1 Samuel,23,20,"Yo, King! If you really wanna come down and get what you want, we'll make sure he gets handed over to you, like no problem."
1 Samuel,23,21,"And Saul was like, Yo, you guys are totally blessed by the LORD 'cause you've shown mad compassion towards me."
1 Samuel,23,22,"Hey guys, can you please go ahead and do me a favor? Like, find out where this dude hangs out, who's seen him there, and what he's been up to. Apparently, he's been pulling off some sneaky moves, so I need all the info on him. Thanks!"
1 Samuel,23,23,"So, like, make sure you check out all the spots where he's hiding and gather solid info. Like, come back to me with the deets and I'll totally join you. And listen up, if he's still in the land, I'll search high and low in every corner of Judah to find him."
1 Samuel,23,24,"So they got up and headed to Ziph ahead of Saul, while David and his crew were chilling in the wilderness of Maon, down south near Jeshimon."
1 Samuel,23,25,"So Saul and his squad went searching for him. They found out that David had gone to hide in a secluded spot in the wild lands of Maon. When Saul got wind of this, he started chasing after David in the wilderness of Maon."
1 Samuel,23,26,"So, Saul went on one side of the mountain, while David and his crew went on the opposite side. David hurriedly tried to escape because he was afraid of Saul. You see, Saul and his crew totally surrounded David and his peeps, aiming to capture them."
1 Samuel,23,27,"Yo, bro, a messenger just slid into Saul's DMs, saying, 'Yo, hurry up and come through, 'cause the Philistines straight up invaded our turf. They're all over the place, man.'"
1 Samuel,23,28,"So Saul stopped chasing after David and decided to fight against the Philistines instead. And because of that, they named that place Selahammahlekoth. (Selahammahlekoth means The rock of divisions)"
1 Samuel,23,29,So David dipped from there and crashed at some really cool hideouts in Engedi.
1 Samuel,24,1,"So, when Saul came back from chasing the Philistines, he was informed that David was chilling out in the wilderness of Engedi. Just wanted to let you know, fam. #casual"
1 Samuel,24,2,So Saul gathered three thousand top-notch peeps from all over Israel and went to hunt down David and his squad in the rocky hangout of those wild goats.
1 Samuel,24,3,"So, like, he arrived at this sheepcotes place and there happened to be a cave nearby. And then Saul went inside to take a little break, while David and his squad chilled out on the outskirts of the cave."
1 Samuel,24,4,"Yo, David's homies were like, 'Yo bro, remember when the LORD told you that He'll hand your enemy over to you, so you can do whatever you want with him?' Then David was like, 'Bet!' and went ahead and snuck up on Saul, cutting off a piece of his robe on the low. (By the way, it was Saul's robe, just to clarify.)"
1 Samuel,24,5,"So, basically, after the whole Saul situation, David felt really guilty inside because he had totally snipped off a piece of Saul's clothing."
1 Samuel,24,6,"And he was like, no way am I gonna do that to my boss, the chosen one of the big man upstairs. Like, I ain't about to lay a hand on him 'cause he's basically chosen by the big man himself. No chance, bro."
1 Samuel,24,7,So David told his squad to chill and not attack Saul. But Saul bounced out of the cave and dipped out.
1 Samuel,24,8,"Then David got up and left the cave. He called out to Saul, like, 'Yo, my dude, the king!' When Saul turned around, David humbly bowed down, like, face to the ground."
1 Samuel,24,9,"So David was like, 'Dude, why are you listening to all these people spreading rumors that I'm out to get you, Saul? Like, seriously?'"
1 Samuel,24,10,"Listen up, fam, today you saw for yourself how the Lord handed you over to me in this cave. Some peeps even told me to slay you, but your boy showed mercy. I was like, nah fam, I can't lay a finger on my lord 'cause he's God's chosen one."
1 Samuel,24,11,"Hey Dad, check this out. Look, I've got a piece of your robe in my hand. Just so you know, I only cut off the edge of your robe, I didn't harm you at all. I want you to see that I didn't do anything wrong or break any rules. I haven't done anything to harm you, but you're still after me, trying to capture me."
1 Samuel,24,12,May the LORD be the judge in this situation and seek justice for me against you. But I won't take matters into my own hands.
1 Samuel,24,13,"As the OGs used to say, evil comes from those who are evil: but I ain't gonna lay a finger on you."
1 Samuel,24,14,"Who's the king of Israel chasing after? Seriously, who's worth all this effort? A dead dog? A stupid flea?"
1 Samuel,24,15,"So like, may the LORD be the one to like settle this, you know? May He like be the judge and just, you know, decide what's up between you and me? And, like, may He see the whole situation clearly and, like, fight my corner and rescue me from you. You get me?"
1 Samuel,24,16,"So, like, when David finished saying all this stuff to Saul, Saul was like, 'Hey, is that your voice, my dude David?' And then Saul started crying loudly."
1 Samuel,24,17,"And he was like, yo David, you're hella righteous, bro. 'Cause you've been cool to me, but I've been shady with you."
1 Samuel,24,18,"And today, you've totally proven that you've treated me well. I mean, seriously, when the Big Guy upstairs gave you the chance to take me out, you didn't even go for it. #Blessed"
1 Samuel,24,19,"Like, if someone runs into their enemy, are they just gonna let them walk away unscathed? So, like, the Lord should totally give you good stuff for being awesome and doing me a solid today."
1 Samuel,24,20,"Yo, listen up. I'm telling you straight, no cap. I know for sure that you're gonna be the king, like, no doubt. And I can guarantee that the kingdom of Israel is gonna be in your hands, no questions asked."
1 Samuel,24,21,"So like, promise me, for real, in the name of the LORD, that you won't wipe out my descendants after me, and you won't totally erase my name from my family's record."
1 Samuel,24,22,"So, David promised Saul and Saul went back home. But David and his squad headed up to the stronghold."
1 Samuel,25,1,"So, like, Samuel passed away and all the Israelites gathered up and were like, super sad, you know? They had this big funeral for him at his house in Ramah. And then David, he got up and headed on down to this desert area called Paran."
1 Samuel,25,2,"Yo, there was this dude in Maon, his crib was in Carmel. This guy was straight up rich, owning three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. He was in Carmel, shearing his sheep and handling his business, you know?"
1 Samuel,25,3,"So there was this guy named Nabal, and he was married to this awesome woman named Abigail. Abigail was not only super smart, but also had a really pretty face. But Nabal, on the other hand, was just rude and did a lot of bad stuff. Oh, and by the way, Nabal was part of Caleb's family."
1 Samuel,25,4,So David found out while he was out in the wild that Nabal was busy shearing his sheep.
1 Samuel,25,5,"So David DM'd ten of his bros and was like, 'Yo, squad, head over to Carmel and hit up Nabal. Tell him I'm saying what's up in my name: peace out!'"
1 Samuel,25,6,"And this is how you should say to someone who's doing well in life: 'Hey, hope everything's chill for you, peace to you and your fam, and may peace be with all your stuff.'"
1 Samuel,25,7,"Yo, I just got the word that you've hired some shearers. Just so you know, when your crew was rollin' with us, we never disrespected or messed with them at all. They were chill the whole time in Carmel. (Note: 'hurt' in Hebrew means 'shamed')"
1 Samuel,25,8,"Go ask your squad, they'll fill you in. Let the squad please you, because we're having a lit time. Just give whatever you got to your homies and to your boy David."
1 Samuel,25,9,"And when David's squad pulled up, they straight up approached Nabal and dropped David's message. And then they bounced. #MicDrop #DavidSquadOut"
1 Samuel,25,10,"And Nabal was like, who's this David guy? And who's Jesse's son? There are so many servants nowadays who ditch their masters."
1 Samuel,25,11,"So, like, should I really hand over my food and stuff that I prepared for my crew to random dudes that I don't even know where they came from?"
1 Samuel,25,12,"So David's squad bounced back, and they came back and spilled all the tea to him."
1 Samuel,25,13,"And David was like, 'Yo, squad, equip yourselves with swords!' So all the boys strapped on their swords, including David himself. Then, about four hundred homies rolled with David, while two hundred stayed behind to guard the stuff."
1 Samuel,25,14,"So, like, this young dude goes up to Abigail, Nabal's wife, and he's all like, 'Guess what? David sent his people from the middle of nowhere to greet our boss, but dude totally dissed them.' (BTW, to diss them, he literally flew at them with harsh words.)"
1 Samuel,25,15,"The guys were really cool to us, and nothing bad happened to us. We didn't lose or miss anything while we were hanging out with them in the fields."
1 Samuel,25,16,"They were like our ultimate squad, protecting us day and night while we hung out, watching over those sheep."
1 Samuel,25,17,"So, like, you need to, like, think about what you're gonna do, okay? 'Cause there's some serious trouble coming our way, and it's directed straight at our boss and his entire fam. This guy is, like, the definition of trouble, making it impossible for anyone to even talk to him."
1 Samuel,25,18,"Abigail quickly grabbed 200 loaves, 2 bottles of wine, 5 sheep all prepared for feasting, 5 servings of roasted corn, 100 clusters of raisins, and 200 cakes of figs. She loaded them all up on donkeys like a boss. (Note: 'clusters' could also mean 'lumps' btw)"
1 Samuel,25,19,"Yo, she said to her crew, 'Y'all go ahead of me, I'm comin' right after. But she didn't spill the tea to her hubby, Nabal'."
1 Samuel,25,20,"As she was riding on the donkey, she went down the hill, and guess what? David and his squad came down towards her, and they bumped into each other."
1 Samuel,25,21,"So like, David was thinking, man, I've totally wasted my time protecting this dude's stuff out in the wild. I made sure nothing got lost, and how does he repay me? With straight up negativity after I showed him kindness. Like, seriously?!"
1 Samuel,25,22,"And God will do even worse to David's enemies. If I leave even a single one of them alive come morning, I swear on everything I hold dear."
1 Samuel,25,23,"When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her ride, humbly fell before him, and bowed down to the ground."
1 Samuel,25,24,"And I like totally crashed down at his feet and was like, yo bro, put this blame on me, and like pretty please, let me speak to you and like, hear me out, dude."
1 Samuel,25,25,"Please, don't pay attention to this worthless guy named Nabal, my lord. His name suits him perfectly because he's nothing but a fool. But I, your servant, didn't see the young men you sent, my lord."
1 Samuel,25,26,"Yo, listen up, my dude! Swear to the Lord above and swear on your own life that the Lord stopped you from messin' up and takin' matters into your own hands. Now, let your enemies and all those tryna do evil to you, be like Nabal. (Avenging...: In other words, savin' yourself)"
1 Samuel,25,27,"And like, yo, this really dope blessing that your girl brought for you, lord, you should totally share it with your squad of youngins who be following you and stuff. Blessing, gift, whatever you wanna call it. They walk at your feet and all that, ya know?"
1 Samuel,25,28,"Hey, can you please forgive me for any mistakes I've made? I know that God will definitely bless you with a stable and successful future, because you're always standing up for what's right and never doing anything wrong."
1 Samuel,25,29,"But there's a guy chasing you, trying to harm you. But my lord's soul will be safe and protected by the Lord your God, like a precious bundle. And as for your enemies, their souls will be thrown away by God, like when you flick something out of a sling."
1 Samuel,25,30,"And when the LORD makes good on all the amazing things He has promised to do for you, my lord, and makes you the ruler of Israel;"
1 Samuel,25,31,"Just so you know, my lord, don't feel bad or troubled because you didn't actually harm anyone for no reason or because you took revenge. But when the LORD blesses you, remember your loyal servant here."
1 Samuel,25,32,"And David was like, yo Abigail, big shoutout to the LORD God of Israel for sending you my way today:"
1 Samuel,25,33,"And shoutout to your wisdom, and shoutout to you, for keeping me from getting violent and taking matters into my own hands today."
1 Samuel,25,34,"I swear, as the LORD God of Israel lives, He saved me from hurting you. If you hadn't rushed to meet me, there wouldn't be anyone left from Nabal's crew by morning light - not even guys taking a leak."
1 Samuel,25,35,"So David took what she gave him and said, 'You can go back to your crib in peace. I've listened to you and I'm cool with you.'"
1 Samuel,25,36,"So Abigail went to Nabal's place and, whoa, he was partying hard like a king! Nabal was feeling extra hyped because he was super wasted. That's why Abigail didn't bother telling him anything, not even a single word, until the next morning."
1 Samuel,25,37,"The next morning, once Nabal sobered up and his wife filled him in, he completely lost hope and turned into a literal rock."
1 Samuel,25,38,"So, like, after like ten days or whatever, God totally struck Nabal and he ended up dying."
1 Samuel,25,39,"When David found out that Nabal kicked the bucket, he was like, Praisee the Lord for taking care of me when Nabal dissed me, and for keeping me safe from harm.' Yeah, God totally made sure that Nabal got what he deserved. So David hit up Abigail and asked her to be his wife."
1 Samuel,25,40,"So like, when David's crew rolls up to Abigail in Carmel, they're all like, 'Yo, David totally sent us to ask if you wanna be his wifey, you down?"
1 Samuel,25,41,"And she got up, and bowed down, her face on the ground, and said, Look, I'm your girl, totally down to be a servant and wash the feet of my lord's crew."
1 Samuel,25,42,"Abigail was like, 'Gotta go!' She hopped on a donkey, with her squad of five girls right behind her. She followed David's messengers and ended up becoming his wife. {at her feet: in submission to her}"
1 Samuel,25,43,"David married Ahinoam from Jezreel, and she became one of his wives too."
1 Samuel,25,44,"Saul gave Michal, David's wife, to Phalti (also known as Phaltiel), the son of Laish from Gallim."
1 Samuel,26,1,"So, like, the Ziphites went to Saul in Gibeah and were all like, 'Psst, do you know David is totally hiding out in the hill of Hachilah, right in front of Jeshimon? Like, for real'?"
1 Samuel,26,2,"So Saul flexed and dipped to the wilderness of Ziph, rolling deep with three thousand top-notch dudes from Israel, all ready to hunt down David in the wilderness of Ziph."
1 Samuel,26,3,"So Saul set up camp on the hill of Hachilah, near Jeshimon, on the way. But David stayed in the wilderness, and he noticed that Saul was following him into the wilderness."
1 Samuel,26,4,So David sent out spies and found out that Saul had actually arrived.
1 Samuel,26,5,"So David got up and went to where Saul had set up camp. When David arrived, he saw where Saul was sleeping, along with Abner, the son of Ner, who was in charge of his army. Saul was sleeping in the middle of the camp, surrounded by his soldiers."
1 Samuel,26,6,"So David was like, talking to Ahimelech the Hittite, and Abishai, who's like Joab's bro, and he's all like, 'Yo, who's gonna come with me to Saul's camp?' And Abishai is like, 'Dude, I'm down, I'll go with you.'"
1 Samuel,26,7,"So David and Abishai slid into the scene like stealthy ninjas: lo and behold, Saul was passed out in the ditch, with his weapon stuck in the ground beside him. And Abner and his entourage were snoozing nearby."
1 Samuel,26,8,"Abishai was like, 'Yo, David! God totally handed over your enemy to you today. So, let me just whack him real quick with my spear and finish him off in one shot. No need for a second strike.'"
1 Samuel,26,9,"And David was like, 'Yo, Abishai, don't wreck him, because you can't just go and attack someone who's been chosen by the Lord, all holy and stuff. That ain't gonna make you innocent.'"
1 Samuel,26,10,"David was like, yo, I swear to God, He's gonna totally wreck him. Either he'll die, or he'll straight up get messed up in a fight and lose."
1 Samuel,26,11,"OMG, like, no way I'm gonna harm the chosen one of the LORD. But hey, could you, like, grab the spear and water jug that are near him and let's bounce?"
1 Samuel,26,12,"So David grabbed the spear and the water bottle from Saul's pillow; and they bounced out of there, and nobody peeped, nor knew a thing, because everyone was knocked out; 'cause the Lord made them all pass out."
1 Samuel,26,13,So David went to the other side and stood on top of a hill at a good distance from them:
1 Samuel,26,14,"David shouted to the crowd and called out to Abner, son of Ner, asking him, 'Hey Abner, are you not gonna respond? Then Abner replied, 'Dude, who do you think you are, yelling at the king?'"
1 Samuel,26,15,"David was like, 'Yo Abner, aren't you like, a total legend? I mean, who's even close to being as awesome as you in all of Israel? So why didn't you protect our king, bro? Some random dude tried to take him out, man.'"
1 Samuel,26,16,"Dude, what you did was totally not cool. I swear, if I were God, you'd be in big trouble because you didn't protect the Lord's chosen one, your master. Now look, the spear and water jug that were right by his head are gone. And let me tell you, that's super serious business."
1 Samuel,26,17,"Saul recognized David's voice and asked, 'Is that you, David, my dude?' And David replied, 'Yeah man, it's me! Your boy, your majesty!'}"
1 Samuel,26,18,"And he was like, dude, why are you totally chasing me like this? What did I even do? Like, is there some kind of bad thing I did that I don't even know about?"
1 Samuel,26,19,"Yo, listen up, King! Hear what I gotta say. If God's the one who's got you coming after me, then let Him accept an offering. But if it's just some mortal humans behind it, then they're straight up cursed by the LORD. They've kicked me out and made me lose my place in God's promises, telling me to go worship other gods. Like, seriously?"
1 Samuel,26,20,"So like, please don't let my blood hit the ground in front of the LORD, 'cause the king of Israel is out here chasing after a tiny little bug, just like when someone hunts a bird in the mountains."
1 Samuel,26,21,"Saul was like, dude, I messed up big time. David, my bro, please come back! I promise I won't mess with you anymore because I realized how important you are to me today. Man, I acted like a fool and made a huge mistake."
1 Samuel,26,22,"And Dav1d was like, 'Yo, check out the king's spear! Can someone from the squad come and grab it for him?'"
1 Samuel,26,23,"May the LORD repay each person according to their righteousness and faithfulness. The LORD has handed you over to me today, but I won't lay a finger on the LORD's chosen one."
1 Samuel,26,24,"Hey, listen up! Just like your life is super important to me today, I'm asking for the same kinda importance from the LORD. I'm counting on Him to save me from all the tough times ahead."
1 Samuel,26,25,"Saul was like, 'Yo David, you're blessed, my dude! You're gonna achieve some insane stuff and come out on top.' Then David was like, Wordd!' and went on his journey, while Saul went back to where he came from."
1 Samuel,27,1,"So David thought to himself, man, I'm totally doomed if I stick around Saul. The best move for me is to bounce real quick to Philistine territory. Once I do that, Saul will totally give up on trying to find me anywhere in Israel. That's how I'll escape his clutches. #SurvivalMode"
1 Samuel,27,2,"So David got up and went with his squad of six hundred peeps to meet Achish, the son of Maoch, the big boss of Gath."
1 Samuel,27,3,"So David was chilling with Achish in Gath, along with his squad - each one with their fam. Yeah, David was there too with his two wives, Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail from Carmel, who used to be Nabal's wife."
1 Samuel,27,4,So Saul found out that David went to Gath and stopped looking for him.
1 Samuel,27,5,"So, David was like, 'Yo, Achish! If you think I'm cool and all, let me chill in a town instead of the fancy royal city. I mean, I'm just your servant, ya know?'"
1 Samuel,27,6,"So Achish was like, 'Yo, here's Ziklag for you' and from that day on, Ziklag became part of the kings of Judah till now."
1 Samuel,27,7,"So David basically hung out in Philistine territory for like a whole year and four months. That's like a really long time, bro. Like, seriously, it was a crazy long time. You feel me?"
1 Samuel,27,8,"So David and his squad rolled up and straight up wrecked the Geshurites, Gezrites, and Amalekites. Like, these nations had been living in the land for a minute, all the way from Shur to Egypt. *Note: Gezrites could also be called Gerzites, just FYI."
1 Samuel,27,9,"So David totally wrecked the place, didn't spare anyone, and scooped up all the sheep, oxen, donkeys, camels, and cool clothes. After that, he made his way back to Achish."
1 Samuel,27,10,"Achish asked, 'Where did you guys go today?' And David replied, 'We went down to the south of Judah, and to the south of the Jerahmeelites, and to the south of the Kenites.'"
1 Samuel,27,11,"So David spared no one, man or woman, to send a message to Gath, because he didn't want them spreading the word about what he did. He wanted to make it clear that his actions would always be the same while he was living among the Philistines."
1 Samuel,27,12,"Achish straight up believed David, like, he made his own peeps in Israel totally hate him. So, David's being all loyal and serving Achish forever, fam. Like, no joke, they're tight now."
1 Samuel,28,1,"So, like, back in the day, the Philistines decided to join forces and gear up for a major fight against Israel. And Achish straight up told David, 'Yo, no doubt, you're rolling with me and your crew to the battlefield.'"
1 Samuel,28,2,"And David was like, yo Achish, you're about to witness some epic skills from your boy. And Achish was like, bet! I'm appointing you as my right-hand homie forever!"
1 Samuel,28,3,"So, like, Samuel had passed away and everyone in Israel was really sad about it. They had a big funeral for him in Ramah, which is his hometown and stuff. Oh, and Saul totally got rid of all the people who were into ghost stuff and magic and stuff like that. He was like, 'Nah, fam, we're not about that life anymore' and kicked them outta the land."
1 Samuel,28,4,"So the Philistines all got together and set up camp in Shunem, and Saul brought all of Israel together and they set up camp in Gilboa."
1 Samuel,28,5,"And when Saul spotted the army of the Philistines, he got majorly scared, and his heart was shaking like crazy."
1 Samuel,28,6,"So, like, Saul went and asked the LORD, but the LORD was like totally ghosting him. No response, no dreams, no Urim, no prophets. Nada."
1 Samuel,28,7,"So, like, Saul was all like, 'Yo, dudes, find me this chick who's, like, some kind of mystical genius, so I can talk to her, you know?' And his bros were all, 'Dude, there's totally this lady in Endor who's got the hookup with that familiar spirit thing.'"
1 Samuel,28,8,"So Saul put on a different outfit and went with two dudes to see the woman at night. He was like, 'Yo, can you use some kind of supernatural power to summon the person I'm gonna tell you about?'"
1 Samuel,28,9,"So, like, this woman was all like, 'Yo, you know what Saul did, right? He straight up got rid of all the peeps who were into that whole spirit communication and wizardry stuff in the land. So why are you trying to trap me and make me die?'"
1 Samuel,28,10,"And Saul swore to her by the LORD, like, seriously, saying, 'I swear on God, nothing bad is gonna go down because of this.'"
1 Samuel,28,11,"The woman was like, 'Yo, who you want me to summon?' And he's all like, 'Summon Samuel for me, fam.'"
1 Samuel,28,12,"When the woman saw Samuel, she straight up freaked out and started yelling loudly. She went up to Saul and was like, 'Dude, why did you trick me? You're totally Saul!'"
1 Samuel,28,13,"Then the king was like, don't stress: what did you see? And the woman was like, yo Saul, I saw some gods coming up from the ground."
1 Samuel,28,14,"And he's like, 'Yo, what's this dude look like?' And she's all like, 'Yeah, it's an old dude coming up, and he's wearing a cloak.' And Saul's like, 'Oh snap, that's Samuel!' So he straight up bows down with his face to the ground and shows mad respect."
1 Samuel,28,15,"Samuel was like, 'Dude, why did you disturb my peace by calling me up?' And Saul was like, 'Bro, I'm totally freaking out here! The Philistines be waging war on me, and it feels like God ghosted me! I'm not getting any answers, not from the prophets or even in my dreams. That's why I reached out to you, hoping you could tell me what steps to take.'"
1 Samuel,28,16,"Samuel was like, dude, why are you even asking me when you know the LORD has left you and is against you now?"
1 Samuel,28,17,"And the LORD totally did what he said through me: he snatched the kingdom away from you and gave it to your friend, David. Like, it's totally his now. #SorryNotSorry"
1 Samuel,28,18,"You didn't listen to the LORD's voice or unleash His fierce anger on Amalek, so that's why the LORD made this happen to you today."
1 Samuel,28,19,"And like, the LORD is gonna let the Philistines conquer Israel with you, ya know? Tomorrow, you and your sons will be with me, man. The LORD's gonna deliver the whole army of Israel to the Philistines, dude."
1 Samuel,28,20,"Saul totally collapsed on the ground and freaked out big time because of what Samuel said. He was completely drained and weak, probably because he hadn't eaten anything all day or night."
1 Samuel,28,21,"The woman went to Saul and saw that he was really stressed. She said to him, 'Look, I've followed your orders and put myself at risk. I listened to everything you told me.'"
1 Samuel,28,22,"So like, please, just listen up, alright? Give me a sec to do something nice for ya. I'll hook you up with a little piece of bread to eat so you'll have the energy to continue on your journey."
1 Samuel,28,23,"But like, he was all like, 'Nah, I'm good, not gonna eat.' But then his peeps, along with the chick, were like, 'Come on, dude!' And he actually listened, got up from the floor, and plopped himself onto the bed."
1 Samuel,28,24,"So the woman had a total chonker of a calf at home. She quickly got to work and slaughtered it, then grabbed some flour, kneaded it like a boss, and baked some totally unleavened bread out of it:"
1 Samuel,28,25,And she brought it to Saul and his squad; and they chowed down. Then they bounced and dipped that night.
1 Samuel,29,1,"So, like, the Philistines got together all their armies and headed to Aphek, while the Israelites set up camp by this cool fountain in Jezreel."
1 Samuel,29,2,"And the leaders of the Philistines moved forward in groups of hundreds and thousands, while David and his crew stayed in the rear with Achish."
1 Samuel,29,3,"The Philistine leaders were like, why are these Hebrews hanging around? And Achish, one of the Philistine leaders, was like, hey guys, isn't this David? He used to serve Saul, the King of Israel. He's been with me for a while now, and honestly, I haven't found anything wrong with him since he started chilling with us."
1 Samuel,29,4,"The Philistine leaders got super angry at him and said, 'Send this guy back home so he doesn't mess things up in the battle. How can he make up with his master if he fights against us? He should stick with his own people!'"
1 Samuel,29,5,"Yo, isn't this David, the dude they were hyping up in the dances, like Saull handled a few, but David straight up owned the ten thousands'?"
1 Samuel,29,6,"So Achish called David and told him, 'You've been cool and trustworthy since you joined my crew. I've never caught you doing anything sketchy or shady. But FYI, the higher-ups aren't really feeling you, bro.'"
1 Samuel,29,7,"So like, just chill and go back peacefully, ya know? Don't wanna tick off the Philistine bosses. Don't do anything sketchy in their eyes, fam."
1 Samuel,29,8,"And David was like, hold up, Achish, what did I do wrong? I've been loyal to you this whole time. Why can't I go and fight against my lord the king's enemies?"
1 Samuel,29,9,"And Achish was like, dude, David, you're like totally righteous in my eyes, I mean, you're like an actual angel from God or something! But, you gotta know, the Philistine leaders are all like, nah, he can't join us in the battle."
1 Samuel,29,10,"So, like, get up really early in the morning with your master's squad that came with you. And once you're awake and it's bright outside, bounce."
1 Samuel,29,11,"So David and his squad woke up super early to bounce in the morning, heading back to the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines rolled up to Jezreel."
1 Samuel,30,1,"So, like, David and his squad pulled up to Ziklag after three days, and guess what? Those Amalekites totally rolled in and wrecked the place. They straight up attacked Ziklag, set it on fire and left it in ruins."
1 Samuel,30,2,"And they captured the women there, but they didn't hurt anyone, whether they were important or not. They just took them and kept going."
1 Samuel,30,3,"So David and his squad pulled up to the city and, like, oh my gosh, it was totally torched! Plus, their wifey and kiddos got snatched up by the enemy. Such a major bummer, dude."
1 Samuel,30,4,"So David and his crew, they started bawling their eyes out, like they couldn't even cry anymore because they were so drained."
1 Samuel,30,5,"So like, David's two wives got captured, one was Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and the other was Abigail, who was Nabal the Carmelite's wife."
1 Samuel,30,6,"David was freaking out big time because everyone was talking about throwing rocks at him. They were super upset and heartbroken over their kids. But David lifted himself up and found strength in the Lord, his God."
1 Samuel,30,7,"So David was like, 'Yo Abiathar, you're Ahimelech's son right? Can you hook me up with the ephod?'. And Abiathar was all like, 'Sure thing bro', and brought the ephod to David."
1 Samuel,30,8,"So David hits up God and asks, like, 'Yo, should I chase after these guys? Can I catch up to them?' And God's like, 'Yeah, dude, go for it! You'll totally catch up to them and get everything back, no doubt.'"
1 Samuel,30,9,"So David and his squad of six hundred homies rolled up to the brook called Besor, where the rest of the crew stayed back."
1 Samuel,30,10,"So David kept going, with him and his squad of four hundred bros. But like, two hundred of them were totally wiped, so they couldn't even cross that stream called Besor, bro."
1 Samuel,30,11,"So they stumbled upon this Egyptian dude chilling in the field, and they brought him to David. They hooked him up with some bread, and he totally chowed down. Oh, and they even gave him some water to wash it all down."
1 Samuel,30,12,"And they gave him a slice of fig cake, and two bunches of raisins. And after he had eaten, he felt alive again, 'cause he hadn't eaten any bread or drank any water for three whole days and nights."
1 Samuel,30,13,"David asked him, 'Who do you belong to and where are you from?' The young man replied, 'I'm an Egyptian dude, a servant of an Amalekite. My master ditched me because I've been sick for three days now.'"
1 Samuel,30,14,"So, like, we totally came at the south side of those Cherethites, and also the coast that belongs to Judah, and the south side of Caleb. And yo, we straight up set Ziklag on fire, no joke."
1 Samuel,30,15,"David was like, 'Yo, can you help me take down this crew?' And the guy was like, 'Bro, swear on God that you won't murder me or hand me over to your boss, and I got you. I'll help you take 'em down.'"
1 Samuel,30,16,"And when he finally brought him down, check it out, they were all over the place on the whole earth, grubbing on some food and drinks, and busting some moves, all because of the crazy amount of epic loot they scored from the Philistine territory and Judah!"
1 Samuel,30,17,"So David totally wrecked them from dusk till dawn the next day, and not a single one got away except for these 400 dudes on camels who made a run for it."
1 Samuel,30,18,And David totally got back everything that those Amalekites had taken away: and David saved his two wives.
1 Samuel,30,19,"And they didn't lack anything at all - not even the small stuff or the big stuff, not their sons or daughters, not their loot, or anything they had acquired. David got it all back."
1 Samuel,30,20,"So David grabbed all the flocks and herds and drove them alongside the other animals. He declared, 'This is David's loot.'"
1 Samuel,30,21,"So David rolled up on about 200 dudes who were so exhausted they couldn't keep up with him. These dudes had been chillin' at the brook Besor. They decided to come out and greet David and his crew. When David got close, he gave them a friendly shoutout and asked how they were doing."
1 Samuel,30,22,"All the bad dudes and losers who were with David answered and said, 'Since those guys didn't roll with us, we ain't sharing any of the loot we got, except for their wives and kids. They can take them and bounce.'"
1 Samuel,30,23,"And David was like, yo dudes, let's not go that route, my fam, with all the stuff that the Lord has blessed us with. He's protected us and straight up handed over our enemies to us."
1 Samuel,30,24,"Like, who's gonna listen to you about this? But, like, those who actually go into battle and those who stay back to guard the stuff, they both deserve a fair share of the spoils."
1 Samuel,30,25,"And like, from that day on, he totally made it a legit rule for all of Israel, even until now. Like, seriously, it's been a thing from then, you know?"
1 Samuel,30,26,"So, when David arrived at Ziklag, he sent some of the loot to the older peeps of Judah, ya know, his homies. He was like, 'Yo, check it out, got a little gift for ya from the stuff we took from the enemies of the LORD, like a super blessed gift and all.'"
1 Samuel,30,27,"To all the peeps in Bethel, and to those chilling in south Ramoth, and to the homies in Jattir,"
1 Samuel,30,28,"And shoutout to the homies in Aroer, Siphmoth, and Eshtemoa,"
1 Samuel,30,29,"And to the squad in Rachal, and to the homies in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to the fam in the cities of the Kenites,"
1 Samuel,30,30,"And to those who were chillin' in Hormah, and to those who were vibin' in Chorashan, and to those who were kickin' it in Athach,"
1 Samuel,30,31,"And to the squad in Hebron, and to all the spots where David and his crew used to chill."
1 Samuel,31,1,"So, like, the Philistines were totally goin' at it with Israel, and the dudes from Israel panicked and, like, ran away from the Philistines, and ended up gettin' all wrecked on Mount Gilboa. {slain: or, wounded}"
1 Samuel,31,2,"And the Philistines were right on Saul's tail, chasing after him and his sons. They managed to defeat Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, who were Saul's sons."
1 Samuel,31,3,"So Saul was having a tough time in the battle, and then the archers nailed him with their shots. He got seriously messed up by those archers, like, he was totally wounded. It was like, bam! Right on target. (BTW, archers = dudes with bows, just FYI)"
1 Samuel,31,4,"So Saul told his homie with the weapons, yo, pull out your sword and stab me with it. I don't wanna get wrecked and made fun of by these uncircumcised fools. But his homie was too scared, so Saul just grabbed a sword himself and yeeted on it."
1 Samuel,31,5,"And when his bro saw that Saul was gone, he did the same thing and went out like a legend, falling upon his weapon and joining him in the afterlife."
1 Samuel,31,6,"So like, Saul, his three sons, his armorbearer, and all his men straight up died on that very day, all at once."
1 Samuel,31,7,"OMG, when the Israelite dudes on the other side of the valley and those across the Jordan River saw that the Israelite dudes were running away and that Saul and his sons were dead, they totally abandoned their cities and took off. Then the Philistines moved in and made themselves at home."
1 Samuel,31,8,"The next day, when the Philistines came to loot the dead bodies, they discovered that Saul and his three sons had been defeated on Mount Gilboa."
1 Samuel,31,9,"So, they totally chopped off his head, stripped off his epic armor, and like, sent it to all the Philistine peeps to flex over their idols and show off to everyone in town."
1 Samuel,31,10,"So they stored his armor in the house of Ashtaroth, and hung his body on the wall of Bethshan."
1 Samuel,31,11,"And when the people of Jabeshgilead found out what the Philistines did to Saul, it was like, woah, big news, you know?"
1 Samuel,31,12,"So like, all these super brave dudes got up and hustled through the night to snatch Saul's body and his sons' bodies off the wall of Bethshan. They headed over to Jabesh and straight up burned them there."
1 Samuel,31,13,"And they grabbed their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and went on a total social media detox for a whole week."
2 Samuel,1,1,"So, like, after Saul died and David came back from whooping the Amalekites' butts, David chilled in Ziklag for a couple of days."
2 Samuel,1,2,"So, like, on the third day, this guy comes out of the camp, right? His clothes are all torn and he's got dirt on his head and stuff. And, boom, when he reaches David, he falls to the ground and shows mad respect."
2 Samuel,1,3,"So David was like, 'Yo, where'd you come from?' And the dude was like, 'Bro, I just escaped from the Israel camp.'"
2 Samuel,1,4,"So David was like, dude, what went down? Seriously, spill the tea. And the guy's all like, bro, everyone ditched the fight, and a bunch of them got wrecked. Plus, Saul and Jonathan, his son, they're both gone too. Just like, dead. Yeah, it's messed up, man."
2 Samuel,1,5,"David was like, 'Yo, how do you even know for sure that Saul and Jonathan, his son, are dead?'"
2 Samuel,1,6,"So, this dude who saw it go down, was like, I randomly stumbled upon mount Gilboa, and guess what? Saul was leaning on his spear, and there were the mad chariots and horsemen chasing after him, yo!"
2 Samuel,1,7,"And like, when he turned around, he spotted me and reached out to me. And I was like, yo, what's up? And I was all like, here I am, like totally ready to be there for you, you know?"
2 Samuel,1,8,"And he was like, 'Yo, who you be?' And I was like, 'I'm an Amalekite.'"
2 Samuel,1,9,"He was like, yo, come at me again and take me down, 'cause I'm feeling mad stressed out with this heaviness in my life that's just weighing me down. It's like my armor is holding me back, you know?"
2 Samuel,1,10,"So, like, I totally went for it and took him down because I knew there was no way he could survive the fall. Then, I grabbed the crown off his head and the bracelet off his arm and I brought them here for my boss, ya know."
2 Samuel,1,11,"So David, like, literally grabbed his clothes and tore them apart, and all the other dudes with him were like, doing the same thing, you know:"
2 Samuel,1,12,"And they were like super sad and cried a ton and didn't eat all day, you know, for Saul, and his son Jonathan, and the people who believed in God, and for all Israel, because they got killed in battle."
2 Samuel,1,13,"David asked the dude who gave him the scoop, 'Where do you come from?' And he replied, 'I'm from out of town, I'm an Amalekite.'"
2 Samuel,1,14,"And David was like, dude, weren't you even scared to reach out and mess with someone who was chosen by the LORD?"
2 Samuel,1,15,"So David grabbed one of his homies, and was like, 'Yo, get close to him and take him down.' And then he straight up knocked him out and killed him."
2 Samuel,1,16,"David was like, 'Bro, your actions are on you, 'cause you straight up confessed to killing the chosen one of the LORD with your mouth, man.'"
2 Samuel,1,17,"So, like, David was filled with sadness and wrote this really deep lament about Saul and his son Jonathan:"
2 Samuel,1,18,"He told them to teach the kids in Judah how to shoot bows—like, it's right there in the Jasher book. (Just so you know, 'Jasher' means 'upright' in case you were wondering.)"
2 Samuel,1,19,"Dude, it's so heartbreaking! The cool peeps from Israel, they got crushed in the most prominent spots. It's like, why did the strong ones have to go down? It's a total bummer!"
2 Samuel,1,20,"Don't even spill the tea in Gath, don't flex in the streets of Askelon. We don't want those Philistine girls getting too hyped, or the uncircumcised girls flexing too hard."
2 Samuel,1,21,"Yo, Gilboa mountains, no need for any dew or rain to fall on you. Don't expect any fields of offerings either. It's because over there, the shield of the mighty Saul was shamefully discarded, like it wasn't even anointed with oil."
2 Samuel,1,22,"The epic moves of Jonathan and Saul were unmatched - they never held back, leaving a trail of fallen foes and victorious battles. No arrow missed its mark, and no swing of the sword left unfinished business."
2 Samuel,1,23,"Saul and Jonathan were totally awesome and had the best vibes while they were alive. Even in death, they stayed tight and loyal to each other. They were faster than eagles and stronger than lions. Like, seriously impressive, man. #SquadGoals #Legends"
2 Samuel,1,24,"Yo, Israelite girls, shed tears for Saul, the one who hooked you up with fire red outfits and other dope stuff, and decked you out with gold bling on your clothes."
2 Samuel,1,25,"OMG, the mighty ones totally got wrecked in the battle! Jonathan, dude, you got taken out while holding your ground at a high spot."
2 Samuel,1,26,"Dude, I'm really bummed out for you, my bro Jonathan. You've always been super cool to me, like seriously awesome. Your love for me has been next level, even stronger than any love from girls."
2 Samuel,1,27,"Yo, the strong ones have totally bit the dust and their weapons of war? They're straight up gone!"
2 Samuel,2,1,"So, like, David was all like, 'Yo, LORD, should I like, go to any of the cities in Judah?' And the LORD was all like, 'Yeah, dude, go for it.' Then David was like, 'Cool, but, um, where should I go?' And the LORD was like, 'Hebron, my dude.'"
2 Samuel,2,2,"So David went up there, and his two wives were with him, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail, who was married to Nabal the Carmelite dude."
2 Samuel,2,3,"David brought all his homies with him and they flexed to Hebron, where they set up shop in different cities, along with their fams."
2 Samuel,2,4,"So, the dudes from Judah rolled up and they totally crowned David as the king of Judah. And they hit up David, like, yo, it was the dudes from Jabeshgilead who took care of Saul's burial."
2 Samuel,2,5,"So David like DM-ed the guys from Jabeshgilead and was like, yo, you guys are totally blessed by the LORD for being so cool to your lord, Saul, and giving him a proper burial."
2 Samuel,2,6,"And now may the LORD bless you with kindness and honesty: and I will also repay you for your kindness, because you did this thing."
2 Samuel,2,7,"So like, it's time to step up, be strong, and show some courage! 'Cause Saul, your leader, is no more, and the people of Judah have chosen me as their king. Be like, the sons and daughters of bravery, you know?"
2 Samuel,2,8,"So Abner, Saul's main man, grabbed Ishbosheth, Saul's son, and took him to Mahanaim. (BTW, Ishbosheth's other name is Eshbaal.)"
2 Samuel,2,9,"And gave him the crown to rule Gilead, the Ashurites, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin, and all of Israel."
2 Samuel,2,10,"Ishbosheth, Saul's son, was, like, forty years old when he started being the boss of Israel and reigned for two years. But the homies in Judah were all about David."
2 Samuel,2,11,"So, like, David was totally ruling in Hebron for, like, seven years and six months, you know? It was, like, a pretty long time n' all. {time: BTW, Hebrew peeps count it in days}"
2 Samuel,2,12,"So Abner, Ner's kid, and the squad of Ishbosheth (the son of Saul) left Mahanaim and rolled up to Gibeon."
2 Samuel,2,13,"So Joab, Zeruiah's son, and David's crew all dipped out and linked up at the Gibeon hot spot. They parked themselves on opposite ends of the pool, just chillin'."
2 Samuel,2,14,"Abner was like, 'Yo Joab, tell the squad to get up and entertain us.' And Joab was all like, 'Yeah, let them get up.'"
2 Samuel,2,15,"So, like, twelve dudes from Benjamin joined Ishbosheth, Saul's son, and twelve other homies from David's squad."
2 Samuel,2,16,"And they like totally grabbed each other by the head, and like stabbed their swords into each other's sides; and they literally fell down together: 'cause of that, the place was named Helkathhazzurim, which is like, in Gibeon. Helkathhazzurim means, like, The field of strong dudes or something."
2 Samuel,2,17,"So, like, there was this intense battle that went down that day, and Abner got totally wrecked along with the whole Israel crew, before David's squad took over."
2 Samuel,2,18,"So there were these three dudes, Joab, Abishai, and Asahel, who were the sons of Zeruiah. And let me tell you, Asahel was like super fast, I'm talking Usain Bolt level speed. Like a wild deer running through the field, this guy was a total speed demon on his feet."
2 Samuel,2,19,"And Asahel was totally after Abner, not slowing down or getting distracted at all. He stayed right on Abner's tail, no zigzagging or taking detours. #FocusedGoals"
2 Samuel,2,20,"Abner turned around and asked, 'Are you Asahel?' And he replied, 'Yep, that's me.'"
2 Samuel,2,21,"And Abner was like, 'Yo, go to the right or left and grab one of the young dudes and snatch their gear.' But Asahel was like, 'Nah, I ain't drifting apart from chasing this dude.'"
2 Samuel,2,22,"And Abner was like, dude, Asahel, chillax and stop following me, man. Why do I gotta hurt you and humiliate myself in front of your bro Joab?"
2 Samuel,2,23,"But he totally didn't want to back down, so Abner straight up hit him with the back end of his spear right in the side, like really hard. The spear went clean through him and came out the other side. He just straight up died right then and there. And it's crazy, but everyone who saw Asahel fall down and die just froze in their tracks, man."
2 Samuel,2,24,"Joab and Abishai were chasing after Abner. They kept going until the sun went down and they reached the hill of Ammah, near Giah on the way to the wildnerness of Gibeon."
2 Samuel,2,25,"So, like, the peeps from Benjamin got together and formed, like, this big squad after Abner. They all chilled on top of a hill, totally united."
2 Samuel,2,26,"So Abner hits up Joab and is like, 'Bro, do we gotta just keep killin' each other? Don't you realize it's gonna bring hella bitterness in the long run? How much longer do we gotta wait before you tell our peeps to stop chasing after their own fam?'"
2 Samuel,2,27,"Joab was like, 'I swear to God, if you hadn't said anything, everyone would have split up in the morning and gone their own way.'"
2 Samuel,2,28,"Then Joab pulled out his phone and played a sick beat, and everyone just froze and stopped chasing after Israel. They were like, nah, no more fighting."
2 Samuel,2,29,"So Abner and his squad decided to march all night long across the plain, crossed over the Jordan River, and trekked through Bithron like bosses. Finally, they arrived at their destination, Mahanaim."
2 Samuel,2,30,"So Joab came back after chasing Abner and realized that nineteen of David's men, including Asahel, were missing."
2 Samuel,2,31,"But David's followers fought against Benjamin and Abner's men, and three hundred and sixty men were killed."
2 Samuel,2,32,So they picked up Asahel and laid him to rest in his father's tomb in Bethlehem. Then Joab and his crew traveled all night and arrived in Hebron by daybreak.
2 Samuel,3,1,"There was, like, this really intense war going on for a while between Saul's fam and David's fam. But David kept leveling up and getting stronger, while Saul's fam just started losing power and getting weaker."
2 Samuel,3,2,"David had some kids while he was chilling in Hebron: his oldest, Amnon, was born to Ahinoam the Jezreelitess."
2 Samuel,3,3,"Also, he had another son named Chileab, who was born to Abigail, the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. And his third son was Absalom, born to Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, the king of Geshur."
2 Samuel,3,4,"Next up, we've got the fourth dude, Adonijah, who's Haggith's son. And coming in at number five, we have Shephatiah, Abital's son. Just keeping you updated!"
2 Samuel,3,5,"And the sixth one, Ithream, was born to David and Eglah, David's wife. They were born when David was in Hebron."
2 Samuel,3,6,"While there was this intense beef going on between the squad of Saul and the squad of David, Abner was totally flexing and boosting Saul's squad."
2 Samuel,3,7,"So Saul had a side piece named Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. And Ishbosheth straight up asked Abner, 'Why'd you go hooking up with my dad's side chick?'"
2 Samuel,3,8,"Abner got super angry when Ishbosheth said that! He was like, am I some worthless dog, being nice to Judah's peeps, the family and homies of Saul your father, and not handing you over to David? And now you're blaming me for this lady situation? Seriously?"
2 Samuel,3,9,"May God deal with Abner likewise, and even more, unless He fulfills His covenant with David; in which case, I will treat him accordingly."
2 Samuel,3,10,"To switch up the ruling fam from Saul to David, and to make David the king of all Israel and Judah, from Dan to Beersheba."
2 Samuel,3,11,"And he, like, couldn't even say anything back to Abner because he was, like, so scared of him."
2 Samuel,3,12,"Abner reached out to David, sending messengers to represent him. He asked, 'Who does this land belong to?' He also proposed, 'Let's make a pact, and you can count on me to rally all of Israel to your side.'"
2 Samuel,3,13,"So the guy was like, alright cool, let's make a pact. But there's just one condition, you can't see my face unless you bring me Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see me. (That's what he meant by 'saying' in Hebrew.)"
2 Samuel,3,14,"So David hit up Ishbosheth, Saul's son, with a message like yo, send me back my girl Michal, you know the one I earned by bringing in a hundred Philistine foreskins."
2 Samuel,3,15,"So Ishbosheth DM'ed her and swiped her away from her husband, Phaltiel (aka Phalti)."
2 Samuel,3,16,"And her husband, like, went with her, totally weeping and walking behind her, all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner was like, dude, go back. So he turned around and went back."
2 Samuel,3,17,"So Abner talked to the OGs of Israel, like, yo, remember when y'all wanted David to be your king? Yeah, it was like just the other day and the day before that too, straight up."
2 Samuel,3,18,"Listen up, fam! The big man upstairs, God, has straight up told us that through David, His servant, He's gonna save His people, Israel, from those wicked Philistines and all their haters. It's gonna go down, no doubt!"
2 Samuel,3,19,"So Abner was like, talking to Benjamin about some stuff, and then he like went over to Hebron to talk to David. He was telling them all the stuff that seemed cool to Israel and the whole house of Benjamin."
2 Samuel,3,20,"So Abner pulled up at David's crib in Hebron, rollin' deep with twenty of his homies. And David threw down a sick feast for Abner and his crew."
2 Samuel,3,21,"Abner straight up told David that he's gonna gather all of Israel to support him and make a dope alliance, so that David can reign over everything he's ever wanted. David was like, 'Alright, Abner, go do your thing' and peace out, no drama."
2 Samuel,3,22,"So, like, guess what? David and Joab's squad was rollin' back from chasing after some enemies, and they came back with a sick amount of loot. But, yo, Abner wasn't with David in Hebron 'cause he sent him away, and Abner left on good terms 'n stuff."
2 Samuel,3,23,"When Joab and all his squad pulled up, they were like, yo Joab, check it, Abner, son of Ner, rolled up to the king and the king let him go unharmed, peace out."
2 Samuel,3,24,"So Joab went up to the king and was like, 'Bro, what's up with you? Abner came to you and you just let him go? Like, why did you let him leave?'"
2 Samuel,3,25,"Yo, you know Abner, Ner's son? He straight up came to trick you, peep all your moves, and be all up in your business, you know what I'm sayin'? He tryna know every single thing you be doin'."
2 Samuel,3,26,"So Joab leaves David and sends a bunch of messages to Abner, who they bring back from the well of Sirah. But David had no clue about any of it."
2 Samuel,3,27,"So when Abner came back to Hebron, Joab pulled him aside at the gate for a hushed conversation, and suddenly attacked him, stabbing him fatally in the ribs, as a revenge for the death of his brother Asahel."
2 Samuel,3,28,"And when David found out about it, he was like, 'Yo, me and my kingdom are totally innocent, like, forever, when it comes to Abner's death. We didn't shed no blood or nothing, man. Blood, you know, like literal blood.'"
2 Samuel,3,29,"Make sure Joab and his family bear the consequences. No one from Joab's household should escape the consequences of illness, be it physical or financial. Let there be no one who suffers from chronic conditions, infectious diseases, disabilities, self-harm, or poverty."
2 Samuel,3,30,Joab and Abishai straight up took out Abner because he had killed their bro Asahel at Gibeon during the epic battle.
2 Samuel,3,31,"So, David told Joab and everyone else who was with him, 'Tear your clothes, put on sackcloth, and show some deep mourning for Abner.' And guess what? King David himself walked behind the funeral stretch. (FYI, a 'bier' is like a fancy bed)"
2 Samuel,3,32,"So they laid Abner to rest in Hebron. And the king spoke up, tears streaming down his face as he stood by Abner's grave. And everyone there couldn't help but shed tears too."
2 Samuel,3,33,"And the king was like, so sad about Abner, and he was like, did Abner die like, in a dumb way?"
2 Samuel,3,34,"Your hands weren't tied, and your feet weren't put in chains, just like when someone falls in front of bad dudes, the same thing happened to you. And everyone started crying over you again."
2 Samuel,3,35,"And when everyone came to offer David some food while it was still daytime, David made a promise, saying, 'I swear to God, and even more, that I won't have any bread or anything else to eat until the sun sets.'"
2 Samuel,3,36,"And everyone paid attention to it, and they thought it was cool: whatever the king did, everyone liked it. (liked it: Hebrew - was good in their eyes)"
2 Samuel,3,37,"Everybody, like, totally got it that day, both the peeps and all of Israel, that it was, like, not cool for the king to straight-up kill Abner, Ner's son."
2 Samuel,3,38,"Yo, did y'all not know that a total legend just bit the dust today in Israel? The king is straight up mourning over it!"
2 Samuel,3,39,"Yo, today I feeling kinda weak even though I'm the anointed king. These dudes, the sons of Zeruiah, they're way too tough for me. But ya know what? The Lord gonna make sure that whoever does evil gets what they deserve, based on how wicked they are."
2 Samuel,4,1,"Dude, when Saul's son found out that Abner bit the dust in Hebron, he was totally bummed out, and all the Israelites were freaking out."
2 Samuel,4,2,"Saul's son had two absolute bosses in his squad: one was named Baanah, and the other was Rechab. They were like the elite warriors from Benjamin, called Rimmon a Beerothite. Beeroth was a part of Benjamin's crew too!"
2 Samuel,4,3,"And the Beerothites, like, totally dipped to Gittaim and crashed there until now, you know what I'm sayin'?"
2 Samuel,4,4,"Yo, check it. Saul's son Jonathan had this son who had a leg injury, like couldn't walk properly. This kiddo was only five when news came about Saul and Jonathan's defeat in Jezreel. In a rush to escape, his nanny scooped him up and they booked it. But unfortunately, the little dude fell and messed up his leg real bad. They ended up calling him Mephibosheth or Meribbaal."
2 Samuel,4,5,"So like, Rechab and Baanah, these dudes from Rimmon the Beerothite, they went to Ishbosheth's crib when it was mad hot during the day, and Ishbosheth was straight up chillin' in bed at noon."
2 Samuel,4,6,"So they went into the house like they were going to get some food, and they attacked him unexpectedly; hitting him right in the gut. Rechab and his brother Baanah managed to get away."
2 Samuel,4,7,"So, when they entered the crib, this dude was chilling on his bed, and they straight-up attacked him, killed him, snatched his head, and got away through the open field, lowkey journeying through the darkness all night long."
2 Samuel,4,8,"So they brought Ishbosheth's head to David in Hebron, and they're like, 'Yo, King! Check out Ishbosheth, your enemy Saul's son! He wanted you dead, but today the LORD made sure you're avenged against Saul and his fam.'"
2 Samuel,4,9,"And David replied to Rechab and Baanah, the bros of Rimmon from Beeroth, and said to them, I swear by the LORD, who has saved my soul from every tough situation,"
2 Samuel,4,10,"So someone came and told me, like, 'Yo, Saul is dead!' and they actually thought they were bringing me good news. But instead of being grateful, I straight up killed the messenger in Ziklag. Can you believe that? Dude really thought I was gonna give him a reward for his little message. Like, no way, man. He got exactly what he deserved."
2 Samuel,4,11,"Like, seriously, think about it – when these evil dudes go and straight up murder an innocent person in their own house, on their bed and all. Like, don't you think I gotta hold these guys accountable for their messed up actions? And, I mean, won't I totally have to deal with you too, and, like, remove you from this world for real?"
2 Samuel,4,12,"So David told his crew to take care of business. With no mercy, they defeated their enemies, taking their hands, feet, and leaving their bodies hanging over the pool in Hebron. And as for Ishbosheth, they respectfully laid his head to rest in Abner's tomb, also in Hebron."
2 Samuel,5,1,"So all the squads of Israel gathered to David in Hebron and said, like, check it out, bro, we're, like, totally your fam and kin."
2 Samuel,5,2,"Back in the day, when Saul was ruling the show, you were the one in charge, guiding and leading Israel. The big man upstairs told you, 'You'll take care of my people, Israel, and be their top chief.'"
2 Samuel,5,3,"So, like, all the OGs of Israel pulled up to the king in Hebron, and King David was like, 'Let's make a pact, fam,' and they all agreed in Hebron before the LORD. And they crowned David as the king of Israel, ya feel me?"
2 Samuel,5,4,"David was, like, totally thirty years old when he took over as king and, like, ruled for a solid forty years."
2 Samuel,5,5,"In Hebron, he was in charge of Judah for, like, 7 years and 6 months. Then in Jerusalem, he ruled over all Israel and Judah for a solid 33 years."
2 Samuel,5,6,"So the king and his squad pulled up to Jerusalem to face the Jebusites, the locals of the land. They straight up told David, 'Yo, if you don't get rid of your squad of blind and disabled peeps, you ain't coming in here.' They actually thought David couldn't handle this place. (Like, duh!)"
2 Samuel,5,7,"But David totally conquered the awesome fortress of Zion, which is legit the city where David himself lived."
2 Samuel,5,8,"So, David was like, yo, whoever can climb up to this ledge and defeat the Jebusites, even if they're lame or blind and I can't stand them, they'll become the boss. That's why people said, no way blind and lame peeps can come inside the crib."
2 Samuel,5,9,So David chillaxed in the fort and named it the city of David. And David straight up built all around from Millo and into the heart of the city.
2 Samuel,5,10,"And David just kept vibing, like, seriously leveling up, and the LORD God of hosts was straight up squad goals, side by side with him. #goals #blessed"
2 Samuel,5,11,"So Hiram, the king of Tyre, hit up David with some DMs, and sent over a bunch of cedar trees, skilled carpenters, and stone-cutting pros, to help build David a dope crib. #HustleHard #HomeSweetHome"
2 Samuel,5,12,"And David was like, 'Yo, God totally made me king over Israel, and He's all about elevating His kingdom for the sake of us, His people, ya know."
2 Samuel,5,13,"And David, like, added more concubines and wives to his crew from Jerusalem, right after he rolled in from Hebron. And, yo, there were still more sons and daughters poppin' out like, 'What up, David?'"
2 Samuel,5,14,"So, like, these are the names of the kids that were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon."
2 Samuel,5,15,"There's also Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, and Japhia, yo!"
2 Samuel,5,16,"And like, Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphalet."
2 Samuel,5,17,"When the Philistines found out that David had been crowned king of Israel, they all came looking for him. David caught wind of it and headed down to the hideout."
2 Samuel,5,18,"Yo, the Philistines pulled up in the valley of Rephaim."
2 Samuel,5,19,"So David asked the LORD, 'Should I take on the Philistines? Will you let me defeat them?' And the LORD answered David, 'Go for it! I'll totally make sure you win against the Philistines.'"
2 Samuel,5,20,"So, David went to Baalperazim and totally defeated them there. He was like, 'Yo, God is totally crushing my enemies, just like a huge flood sweeping in.' That's why he named the place Baalperazim, which means the plain of breaches."
2 Samuel,5,21,"So they got rid of their old pics and David and his squad straight up burned them. {burned...: or, took them away}"
2 Samuel,5,22,"And the Philistines showed up once more, spreading out in the valley of Rephaim."
2 Samuel,5,23,"So, like, when David asked the LORD, He was like, 'Nah, dude, don't go up there. Instead, circle around behind them and ambush them near the mulberry trees.'"
2 Samuel,5,24,"Yo, when you hear the sound of movement in the tops of those mulberry trees, that's the sign to get moving. 'Cause that's when the LORD is gonna go ahead of you and straight up wreck those Philistines."
2 Samuel,5,25,"And David totally nailed it, just as the LORD told him to, and totally wrecked the Philistines from Geba all the way to Gazer. (Geba is also known as Gibeon, BTW.)"
2 Samuel,6,1,"Once again, David rounded up all the elite squad of Israel, a whopping thirty thousand strong."
2 Samuel,6,2,"So David got up and went with his crew from Baale of Judah to bring the ark of God from there. This ark is called by the name of the LORD of hosts, who chills between the cherubims. (Baale is also known as Baalah or Kirjathjearim)"
2 Samuel,6,3,"So they put God's ark on a brand-new ride and took it out from Abinadab's crib in Gibeah. Uzzah and Ahio, Abinadab's boys, were the ones cruising the fresh wheels."
2 Samuel,6,4,"So they took it out of Abinadab's crib in Gibeah, you know, bringing along the God box and Ahio leading the way with it."
2 Samuel,6,5,"So, David and all the cool peeps of Israel jammed out for the LORD using all sorts of sick instruments made of fir wood. They were slaying it on harps, psalteries, timbrels, cornets, and cymbals, no cap."
2 Samuel,6,6,"So, when they arrived at Nachon's spot where they were tossing the grain, Uzzah reached out and touched the sacred chest, because the oxen were causing it to wobble. Nachon, who was also known as Chidon, was the owner of that place. The oxen stumbled, causing the chest to shake."
2 Samuel,6,7,"God got really mad at Uzzah and totally struck him down because of a mistake he made. Uzzah straight up died right there by the ark of God. (And by mistake, I mean he acted without thinking, you feel?)"
2 Samuel,6,8,"And David was really upset, y'know, because the LORD caused this whole thing to go down with Uzzah, and he decided to name the place Perezuzzah from that day on. Perezuzzah, bruh, like, it's where Uzzah made that big mistake and everything fell apart, you feel me?"
2 Samuel,6,9,"And David was shooketh by the Lord that day, and he was like, OMG how can the ark of the Lord come to me?"
2 Samuel,6,10,"David was like, nah, I'm not moving the ark of the LORD to the city of David. Instead, he took it to stay at Obededom the Gittite's crib."
2 Samuel,6,11,"So, the LORD's ark chilled at Obededom the Gittite's crib for three months, and you won't believe it, but God straight-up blessed Obededom and his whole fam. No cap!"
2 Samuel,6,12,"Yo, guess what? King David heard that Obededom's crib got straight up blessed by the LORD, all 'cause of that God's ark situation. So David was like, 'No cap, I'm bringing that ark to the city of David with mad joy.'"
2 Samuel,6,13,"So, like, here's what happened: when the peeps carrying the ark of the LORD took just six steps, they totally offered up some boss oxen and fatlings as a sacrifice."
2 Samuel,6,14,"So, like, David was totally lit AF as he danced his heart out before the LORD. He was rocking this sick linen ephod outfit. It was so epic."
2 Samuel,6,15,So David and all the squad of Israel hyped up the ark of the LORD with mad shouts and epic trumpet beats.
2 Samuel,6,16,"When the sacred ark of the LORD rolled into David's turf, Michal, Saul's daughter, peeped through a window and caught sight of king David busting some sick moves and breaking it down for the LORD. But deep inside, she couldn't stand the sight of him."
2 Samuel,6,17,So they brought in the ark of the LORD and placed it in its spot within the awesome tent that David set up for it. And David made some lit burnt offerings and peace offerings as a way of showing love and respect to the LORD.
2 Samuel,6,18,"After David finished making his burnt offerings and peace offerings, he gave a shoutout to the people in the name of the LORD of hosts."
2 Samuel,6,19,"And he gave food to everyone, both men and women, in the midst of the whole crowd of Israel. Each person received a delicious loaf of bread, a generous serving of meat, and a bottle of wine. So all the people went back to their own homes."
2 Samuel,6,20,"After that, David went back to his crib, ready to flex on his squad. Suddenly, Michal, Saul's daughter, came out to confront David and straight up roasted him. She was like, 'Dude, what a move to show off in front of all those basic handmaids! You basically flashed them shamelessly, just like those attention-seeking losers!'"
2 Samuel,6,21,"So David was like, 'Yo, Michal, I was straight up doing this for the Lord. He picked me over your dad and his whole fam to be the ruler of His peeps in Israel. That's why I was just vibin' and playing in front of the Lord.'"
2 Samuel,6,22,"And I will totally embrace my true self, no holds barred. I'll even lower my own self-esteem just to show you I'm serious. And those maids you mentioned earlier? They're gonna give me mad respect, believe it or not."
2 Samuel,6,23,"So, Michal, Saul's daughter, couldn't have any kids until the day she passed away."
2 Samuel,7,1,"And it happened, when the king was chilling in his crib, and the LORD had totally hooked him up, giving him peace from all his haters;"
2 Samuel,7,2,"So, like, the king was talking to Nathan the prophet, and he's all like, 'Listen up, bro! I've got this cool crib made of cedar, but the ark of God is just chillin' behind some curtains, ya know?'"
2 Samuel,7,3,"And Nathan was like, yo king, go ahead and do whatever you're feeling in your heart 'cause, guess what, the LORD is totally vibing with you."
2 Samuel,7,4,"So, like, one night, God spoke to Nathan, saying,"
2 Samuel,7,5,"Hey, go and tell my guy David something. The LORD says, are you gonna build me a crib for me to chill in?"
2 Samuel,7,6,"Yo, I haven't been chillin' in any crib ever since I freed the Israel fam from Egypt, up until now. I've been rollin' with a tent and a tabernacle vibe."
2 Samuel,7,7,"Yo, in all the places I've been hangin' with the whole squad of Israel, I never said a single word to any of the tribes of Israel that I commanded to take care of my peeps, like, why y'all not buildin' me a dope cedar crib?"
2 Samuel,7,8,"So here's the message for my dude David: The big man upstairs, the mighty LORD, says I plucked you out of that sheep gig and made you the boss of my peeps, over in Israel. {from following: That means I snatched you up after you were all about them sheep}"
2 Samuel,7,9,"And I was totally on your side wherever you went, obliterating all your haters from your view and giving you a legit reputation, on par with the big shots in the world. That's right, they couldn't even stand in your presence."
2 Samuel,7,10,"And I'm gonna set up a sick spot for my peeps, the Israelites, and I'll totally plant them there. They'll have their own chill place to live, no more movin' around. And those haters won't mess with them anymore, like they did back in the day."
2 Samuel,7,11,"Ever since I appointed judges to rule over my squad, the people of Israel, and granted you sweet relief from all your haters, the LORD wants you to know that he's gonna hook you up with a dope crib."
2 Samuel,7,12,"And like, when you're old and stuff and you pass away, I'll make sure your descendants take over. They'll come from like, your own bloodline and I'll totally make sure his kingdom is, like, legit."
2 Samuel,7,13,"He's gonna build a sick crib in my name, and I'll make sure his kingdom reigns forever, fam."
2 Samuel,7,14,"I'll be his dad and he'll be my son. If he messes up, I'll give him a reality check and teach him some tough lessons."
2 Samuel,7,15,"But I promise to always show him love and kindness, just like I did with Saul before you."
2 Samuel,7,16,And your crib and your squad will be lit for all eternity: your throne gonna be hella established forever.
2 Samuel,7,17,"So like, Nathan was all straight up telling David about everything he said and everything he saw."
2 Samuel,7,18,"So, like, King David entered and, like, sat in front of the LORD, and he was all like, 'Um, who am I, Lord GOD? And, like, what's the deal with my house? How come you, like, brought me this far?'"
2 Samuel,7,19,"And like, this was no biggie at all to you, O Lord GOD; but you also talked about my servant's crib for, like, a really long time in the future. And, like, is this how things usually go for humans, O Lord GOD?"
2 Samuel,7,20,"And like, what else can David even say to you, God? 'Cause, like, you already know me inside out!"
2 Samuel,7,21,"You did all these awesome things for me to know about, because of your word and what's in your heart."
2 Samuel,7,22,"Dude, you're literally the coolest, O LORD God. Like, there's seriously no one else like you, and no other God can even come close. We've heard all these amazing things about you through the grapevine."
2 Samuel,7,23,"Yo, no nation on this earth can even come close to being as lit as your people, Israel. God straight up chose y'all and redeemed you, making you his own special crew. He's all about making a name for you and doing some epic and mind-blowing stuff for you and your land, like way better than anything you've ever seen before. Remember how he saved you from Egypt and all those other nations? Yeah, those gods they worshipped got nothing on your God."
2 Samuel,7,24,"You totally locked it in that your squad, Israel, is gonna be your peeps forever. And you, LORD, straight up became their God."
2 Samuel,7,25,"And now, yo God, the talk you had about me and my fam, make it happen for real and do what you said."
2 Samuel,7,26,"So, like, make your name, like, totally awesome forever by, like, saying that the LORD of hosts is, like, the ultimate God over Israel, and, like, may your servant David's family, you know, thrive forever in your presence."
2 Samuel,7,27,"Yo, God, the ultimate boss and the God of Israel, you straight up told your servant that you're gonna build them a house. So, your servant is genuinely feeling it and has this prayer in their heart to talk to you about it."
2 Samuel,7,28,"And yo, O Lord GOD, you're like, the ultimate God, and your words are legit, like, super true, and you've totally promised this awesome goodness to your servant:"
2 Samuel,7,29,"So, God, it would be totally awesome if you could bless your servant's crib, that it stays lit 24/7 in your presence. You've already called it, God, so with your blessings, let your servant's house be blessed forever. #blessed"
2 Samuel,8,1,"So, like, David totally owned the Philistines and got them under his control. He snatched Methegammah, which is like the bridle of Ammah, from the Philistines."
2 Samuel,8,2,"So, like, he totally defeated Moab and stuff, right? He used this measuring line thing to measure them and brought them down to the ground. With two lines, he was like, 'dead' and with one full line, he was like, 'alive'. And dude, those Moabites ended up becoming David's servants and they brought him all these cool gifts."
2 Samuel,8,3,"David totally owned Hadadezer, son of Rehob, the king of Zobah, when he flexed on him at the river Euphrates to reclaim his territory. (Hadadezer, also known as Hadarezer)"
2 Samuel,8,4,"So David took a thousand dope chariots, along with seven hundred sick horsemen and twenty thousand lit foot soldiers. And David totally wrecked all the chariot horses, but he kept a hundred chariots for himself. #QueenStatus"
2 Samuel,8,5,"So, when the Syrians from Damascus tried to help out Hadadezer, who was the king of Zobah, David totally wiped out twenty-two thousand of them!"
2 Samuel,8,6,"So, David set up some squads in Syria, specifically in Damascus, and the Syrians basically became David's loyal peeps. They were all like, 'Here, have some gifts!' And you know what? The LORD totally had David's back wherever he went."
2 Samuel,8,7,"So, David grabbed those sick gold shields that the servants of Hadadezer were flexing with and flexed back by bringing them all the way to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,8,8,"King David grabbed a ton of bronze from Betah and Berothai, two cities of Hadadezer."
2 Samuel,8,9,"When King Toi from Hamath found out that David totally wrecked Hadadezer's army,"
2 Samuel,8,10,"So Toi's son, Joram, slid into King David's DMs to say hi and give him mad props for conquering Hadadezer. Hadadezer and Toi were in a serious feud. Joram brought along some sick gifts like silver, gold, and brass bling. (btw, Joram was also called Hadoram)"
2 Samuel,8,11,"King David flexed on the LORD by dedicating mad cash, including all the bling he acquired from conquering other nations. 🙌"
2 Samuel,8,12,"So, like, Syria, Moab, Ammon, Philistines, Amalek, and the stuff they took from Hadadezer, Rehob's son, yo, he was the king of Zobah."
2 Samuel,8,13,"David got super famous when he came back after totally wrecking the Syrians in the valley of salt. He took down a massive army of eighteen thousand strong. Epic victory, right?"
2 Samuel,8,14,"So, like, David put his squad in Edom. He stationed them all over Edom, and everyone from Edom became David's crew. And, yo, the LORD had David's back no matter where he went."
2 Samuel,8,15,"So David was, like, the ruler of all Israel, and he made sure to dish out some serious judgement and fairness to all his peeps."
2 Samuel,8,16,"And Joab, Zeruiah's kid, was in charge of the crew; and Jehoshaphat, Ahilud's child, was the chronicler."
2 Samuel,8,17,"So, like, Zadok, Ahitub's kid, and Ahimelech, Abiathar's son, were the priests, and Seraiah was the scribe, you know, like the secretary dude."
2 Samuel,8,18,"And Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, had authority over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were like the top-notch leaders. (top-notch leaders: or, super cool rulers)"
2 Samuel,9,1,"So David's like, yo, any of Saul's fam still around? I wanna do something nice for Jonathan's sake, ya know?"
2 Samuel,9,2,"There was this dude named Ziba, who happened to be a servant from the house of Saul. When David called him, the king was like, 'Yo, are you Ziba?' And he was like, 'Yeah, I'm your servant!'"
2 Samuel,9,3,"So the king was like, 'Yo, is there still anyone from Saul's fam around? I wanna show God's kindness to them.' And Ziba was like, 'Yeah, bro, Jonathan's got a son but he's got a bit of a disability — lame on his feet.'"
2 Samuel,9,4,"The king was like, 'Yo, where's he at?' And Ziba was all like, 'Yo, check it, he's chillin' at Machir's crib, son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.'"
2 Samuel,9,5,"So King David hit up this dude named Machir, Ammiel's son, who was chilling in Lodebar, and brought him over."
2 Samuel,9,6,"So, when Mephibosheth, who was Jonathan's son and Saul's grandson, arrived before David, he totally bowed down and showed respect. Then David called out to Mephibosheth, who replied, 'Here I am, your loyal servant!' (By the way, Mephibosheth was also known as Meribbaal.)"
2 Samuel,9,7,"And David was like, yo, don't even trip! I'mma totally hook you up because of the tight bond I had with your pops, Jonathan. You gonna get all the land that belonged to Saul, your old man. And guess what? You gonna be dining at my table all day, every day. No cap."
2 Samuel,9,8,"And he totally humbled himself and was like, yo, why should you even bother noticing someone as worthless as me, like some dead animal?"
2 Samuel,9,9,"The king hit up Ziba, who was Saul's servant, and straight up told him, 'Yo, I hooked your master's son up with everything that belonged to Saul and his whole fam.'"
2 Samuel,9,10,"So, you and your squad, and your peeps, gotta work the land for him, and make sure you bring in the goods, so that your master's offspring can chow down. But Mephibosheth, your master's kid, is gonna have a constant spot at my table. By the way, Ziba had a whole crew of fifteen sons and twenty servants."
2 Samuel,9,11,"So Ziba was like, 'Yo king, I'm totally gonna do whatever you want me to do, just like a good servant.' And the king was like, 'Mephibosheth? Yeah, he's gonna have a seat at my table, just like one of my own kids.'"
2 Samuel,9,12,And Mephibosheth had a cool kid named Micha. And all the peeps living at Ziba's place were straight-up servants for Mephibosheth.
2 Samuel,9,13,"So Mephibosheth stayed in Jerusalem and totally scored a permanent spot at the king's table, even though he couldn't walk 'cos he had a lame condition in both of his feet."
2 Samuel,10,1,"And then, the king of the children of Ammon passed away, and his son Hanun took over as king."
2 Samuel,10,2,"So David was like, 'Yo, I'm gonna be nice to Hanun, Nahash's son, since his dad was nice to me. And he sent his homies to cheer him up and show sympathy because of his dad. And those homies of David went straight into Ammonite territory, no cap."
2 Samuel,10,3,"Yo, Hanun, the dudes from Ammon were like, do you really think David is showing respect to your pops by sending his boys to comfort you? Nah man, David actually sent his servants to scout out the city and wreck it. Do you really think David would do that in your eyes?"
2 Samuel,10,4,"So Hanun decided to mess with David's crew, and totally shaved off half of their beards, and cut their clothes right down the middle, like all the way to their butts, and then sent them packing."
2 Samuel,10,5,"When they told David about it, he DM'd them, cause the guys were mad embarrassed. And the king was like, stay at Jericho until your facial hair game is on point, and then come back."
2 Samuel,10,6,"So, like, when the Ammonites realized that they were totally losing to David, they were like, 'Oh snap, we need some backup.' So they hired these Syrians from Bethrehob and Zoba. They got, like, 20,000 foot soldiers from there, and also a thousand dudes from king Maacah, plus another twelve thousand dudes from Ishtob. (By the way, Ishtob means the men from Tob, in case you were wondering.)"
2 Samuel,10,7,"When David found out about {it}, he texted Joab and all the squad of his most powerful warriors."
2 Samuel,10,8,"So, the Ammonites showed up and prepared for battle at the gate. Meanwhile, the Syrians from Zoba, Rehob, Ishtob, and Maacah were chilling in the field, doing their own thing."
2 Samuel,10,9,"So, like, when Joab peeped that he was totally getting attacked from every direction, he rounded up the absolute best peeps from Israel and got them all ready to battle those Syrians, you know?"
2 Samuel,10,10,"And he handed over the remaining people to his brother Abishai, so that they could form a formation against the kids from Ammon."
2 Samuel,10,11,"He was like, if the Syrians are too OP for me, then you gotta help me out. But if the children of Ammon are too OP for you, then I got your back, fam."
2 Samuel,10,12,"Let's stay strong and reprez our squad for our peeps and our cities that are blessed by God. Trust that the big man upstairs will handle it all, and do what He knows best."
2 Samuel,10,13,"So Joab and his squad rolled up to the battlefield, ready to take on the Syrians. And guess what? The Syrians freaked out and made a run for it, 'cause they knew who they were messing with."
2 Samuel,10,14,"And like, when the peeps from Ammon peeped that the Syrians were dip-dipping, they also hightailed it away from Abishai and went into the city. So Joab hit reverse from the peeps in Ammon and rolled back to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,10,15,"And when the Syrians peeped that they got clapped by Israel, they all linked up together."
2 Samuel,10,16,"So Hadarezer called his people from Syria on the other side of the river and they all gathered at a place called Helam. Shobach, who was the leader of Hadarezer's army, led them. (By the way, 'the river' here means the Euphrates River and 'Shobach' can also be spelled 'Shophach'.)"
2 Samuel,10,17,"So David heard the news, and he called all of his homies in Israel to link up. They crossed the Jordan River and rolled up to Helam. The Syrians saw David coming and were ready to throw down in a straight-up battle."
2 Samuel,10,18,"So the Syrians were totally wrecked by Israel, and David straight up defeated 700 Syrian chariots, 40k horse riders, and took down Shobach, their captain. He totally died there, man. (And by horse riders, I mean foot soldiers too, just fyi)"
2 Samuel,10,19,"And like, all the kings who were, like, working for Hadarezer saw that they got totally wrecked by Israel, so they were like, 'Okay, let's make peace with Israel and become their servants.' And then the Syrians were, like, scared to help the Ammonite children anymore."
2 Samuel,11,1,"So, like, when the year was done and kings usually go out to fight their battles, David sent Joab and his crew and all of Israel. They totally wiped out the Ammonites and laid siege to Rabbah. But David stayed back in Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,11,2,"So, like, one evening David gets up from his bed and decides to chill on the roof of the king's crib. And while he's up there, he spots this gorgeous woman taking a bath. Seriously, she was stunning."
2 Samuel,11,3,"So David slid into the DMs and was like, 'Yo, who's that fine lady?' And someone was like, 'Bro, that's Bathsheba, Eliam's daughter and Uriah the Hittite's wife, you know?'"
2 Samuel,11,4,"So David sent some texts and hooked up with her; she came over and they did the thing. She had already gone through the whole cleansing process, so it was all good. Then she went back home. {or, once she had purified herself, etc, she went back}"
2 Samuel,11,5,"So, like, this woman got pregnant and she texted David and was like, 'Hey dude, guess what? I'm preggers!'"
2 Samuel,11,6,"So David slid into Joab's DMs like, 'Yo bro, send me Uriah the Hittite.' And Joab was like, 'Bet, I'll hook you up.' Then Joab sent Uriah right to David's crib."
2 Samuel,11,7,"When Uriah arrived, David asked him about Joab, the people, and how the war was going. (This means David wanted to know how Joab was doing, how the people were, and how successful the war had been.)"
2 Samuel,11,8,"So David told Uriah, yo, head back home and freshen up. Uriah bounced from the king's crib, and the king hooked him up with a dope spread on the way out."
2 Samuel,11,9,"But Uriah crashed at the king's crib with all his crew, and didn't bounce to his own pad."
2 Samuel,11,10,"So, like, when they told David that Uriah didn't even go home, David was all like, 'Hey, Uriah, didn't you just come back from your trip? So why didn't you go home, man?'}"
2 Samuel,11,11,"So Uriah was like, 'Yo David, the Ark, Israel, and Judah are all chillin' in tents while Joab and his peeps are out in the open fields. You think I'ma go home and Netflix & chill with my wife while they out here grindin'? Nah man, I swear on my life, I'm not gonna do that."
2 Samuel,11,12,"And David was like, 'Yo Uriah, chill here today and tomorrow I'll let you dip. So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem for that day and the next."
2 Samuel,11,13,"And like, David was all 'Yo dude, come eat and chill with me,' and they totally grubbed together. And David went all out and got him super wasted. Then at night, he bounced to crash on his bed with the other servants of his lord, but he didn't go to his own crib, you know?"
2 Samuel,11,14,"So, the next morning, David decided to slide into Joab's DMs and sent a letter with Uriah as the messenger."
2 Samuel,11,15,"Yo, he wrote in the letter, like, put Uriah in the most intense battle, and then step back so he gets hit and dies."
2 Samuel,11,16,"So, like, Joab checked out the city and he sent Uriah to a spot where he knew there were some seriously brave dudes."
2 Samuel,11,17,"So, like, the dudes from the town came out and started a fight with Joab. And, yeah, some of David's crew got taken down, including Uriah the Hittite who bit the dust."
2 Samuel,11,18,So Joab hit up David with all the deets about the war.
2 Samuel,11,19,"And the messenger was like, yo listen up, when you're done spilling the tea about the war to the king,"
2 Samuel,11,20,"And if the king gets mad and asks you, like, why did you come so close to the city when you were fighting? Didn't you know they would shoot at you from the wall?"
2 Samuel,11,21,"Yo, who took out Abimelech, son of Jerubbesheth? Wasn't it a lady who straight up yeeted a chunk of a millstone at him from the wall, causing him to bite the dust in Thebez? And why were y'all even going near the wall, man? Tell Bathsheba that her man Uriah the Hittite is also deceased. (Jerubbesheth, btw, is also known as Jerubbaal.)"
2 Samuel,11,22,So the messenger went and told David everything that Joab had sent him about.
2 Samuel,11,23,"And the messenger was like, 'Yo, David, no cap, those dudes straight up wrecked us! They came at us in the field, and we were on them hard until we reached the gate, fam."
2 Samuel,11,24,"And those shooters totally went off, blasting your loyal peeps from the wall. It's messed up, man! Some of the king's crew got taken out, including Uriah the Hittite, one of your own."
2 Samuel,11,25,"Yo, David told the messenger, here's what you gotta say to Joab. Don't get all bent out of shape about this, man, 'cause in war everyone's at risk. Step up your game and take down that city with all your strength. Give Joab some words of encouragement, yo."
2 Samuel,11,26,"So like, when Uriah's wife found out that Uriah, her husband, had died, she was seriously devastated and mourned for him big time."
2 Samuel,11,27,"After the time of sorrow, David brought her to his crib, and they became husband and wife, and she gave birth to a son. But what David did was not cool with the LORD. {displeased: Hebrew: was evil in the eyes of}"
2 Samuel,12,1,"So, like, God was all, 'Yo, Nathan, go talk to David.' And Nathan was like, 'Sure thing.' So he goes and meets up with David, and he's like, 'Listen up, bro. There were these two dudes who lived in the same city. One was super loaded, and the other was barely scraping by, you know?'"
2 Samuel,12,2,"The rich dude had, like, sooo many flocks and herds:"
2 Samuel,12,3,"But this one poor guy had, like, nothing, except for this one tiny pet lamb that he had bought and raised. And they grew up together, like, as best buds with him and his kids. It would eat from his plate, drink from his cup, snuggle up in his lap, and was, like, basically a part of the fam."
2 Samuel,12,4,"So this dude shows up at this rich guy's place, and the rich dude had more than enough animals of his own to cook for his guest. But instead of using his own, he takes the poor guy's precious lamb and cooks it up for the guest without even asking. Like, seriously? Not cool, bro."
2 Samuel,12,5,"David was super pissed at the dude and he said to Nathan, 'I swear on the Lord's name, the guy who did this deserves to die for sure.'"
2 Samuel,12,6,"And he gotta pay back the lamb four times, 'cause he pulled that move and didn't show any mercy."
2 Samuel,12,7,"And Nathan was like, bro, it's you. This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I chose you to be king over Israel, and I saved you from Saul's grip."
2 Samuel,12,8,"And I hooked you up with your master's crib, and your master's girls, and I even gave you the whole Israel and Judah crib; and yo, if that wasn't enough, I would've given you even more dope stuff."
2 Samuel,12,9,"Yo, why'd you diss the Lord's command and do something wicked in His eyes? You straight up murdered Uriah the Hittite and stole his wifey to make her your own. And to top it off, you killed him with the sword of the Ammonites."
2 Samuel,12,10,"So, like, listen up, from now on there will always be drama in your fam, cuz you dissed me and scooped up Uriah the Hittite's wifey as your own. Not cool, dude."
2 Samuel,12,11,"Yo, listen up! The LORD says, check it out, I'm gonna bring some serious trouble your way, right from within your own family. And get this, I'm gonna snatch your wives right in front of you and give them to your neighbor, and he's gonna be getting cozy with them right under the sun's watchful eye."
2 Samuel,12,12,"You were on the down-low with that move, but I'm about to flex this thing in front of all Israel, and even the sun will witness it."
2 Samuel,12,13,"David was like, 'Yo, Nathan, I messed up big time. I totally sinned against the LORD.' And Nathan was all like, 'Don't stress, dude. The LORD forgives you and won't punish you with death.'"
2 Samuel,12,14,"But, yo, because you just totally gave those enemies of the LORD a legit reason to talk smack, your child that's gonna be born is gonna die for real."
2 Samuel,12,15,"So Nathan went back home. And, like, God made the baby that Uriah's wife had with David really, really sick, man."
2 Samuel,12,16,"So David hit up God for the child, and David decided to go on a serious fasting binge. He stayed up all night, sleeping on the ground like a boss. #dedication #prayinghard"
2 Samuel,12,17,"Then the older peeps in his crib got up and came to him, tryna help him off the ground. But he straight up refused, and didn't even munch on some bread with them."
2 Samuel,12,18,"So on the seventh day, the child passed away. David's crew was scared to break the news to him because while the child was still alive, we talked to him but he ignored us. We thought, if he reacted like that back then, imagine how upset he'll be if we tell him the child is dead?"
2 Samuel,12,19,"But when David peeped that his squad was gossipin', David knew that the child had passed away. So David asked his squad, 'Yo, is the child gone?' And they were like, 'Yeah, he's gone, bro.'"
2 Samuel,12,20,"So David stood up, cleaned up, freshened up, changed his clothes, and went to the house of the LORD to worship. After that, he went back to his own crib and when he asked for it, they served him some grub, and he chowed down."
2 Samuel,12,21,"Yo, his squad said to him, 'Dude, what's up with this? You were fasting and crying for the kid when they were alive, but now that they're dead, you're up and eating food.'"
2 Samuel,12,22,"And he was like, when the kid was still alive, I was totally going through it, fasting and crying and stuff. 'Cause I was thinking, like, who knows if GOD will show me some love and make the kid survive, you know?"
2 Samuel,12,23,"But like, he's gone now, so why should I even bother fasting? Can I like, bring him back? Nah, man. I'm gonna go to him one day, but he can't come back to me."
2 Samuel,12,24,"So David was there for Bathsheba, his wife, and they got intimate and had a baby boy. They named him Solomon, and you know what? The LORD totally loved him."
2 Samuel,12,25,"So, like, God used Nathan the prophet to send a message and He gave him the name Jedidiah, which means like, beloved of the LORD, you know?"
2 Samuel,12,26,"So, Joab went up against Rabbah, which belonged to the Ammonites, and managed to conquer their capital city."
2 Samuel,12,27,"So Joab DM'ed David like, 'Yo dude, just wanna let you know I totally wrecked Rabbah in battle and we finally captured the city with all its water resources."
2 Samuel,12,28,"So, like, gather the rest of the squad and set up camp right outside the city. The goal is to take it over, ya know? I mean, I can't have the city not being known under my name, right? Gotta leave my mark, fam. #CityConquest"
2 Samuel,12,29,"So, like, David gathered all his squad, and they rolled up to Rabbah, ready to throw hands and conquer it."
2 Samuel,12,30,"And he snatched the king's crown right off his head, made out of a whopping chunk of pure gold adorned with stunning gemstones, and he placed it on David's head. Then he paraded around with all the loot he took from the city, a total treasure trove of epic proportions. Like, seriously, it was a crazy amount."
2 Samuel,12,31,"And he like, brought out all the people from there and made them go through these seriously intense tools like saws and iron harrows and iron axes, and even made them pass through a brickkiln, and he did this to all the cities of the Ammonite peeps. So David and the whole crew went back to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,13,1,"So, like, after this happened, there was this guy named Absalom, who was David's son and, like, he had a really gorgeous sister named Tamar. And then there's this other dude, Amnon, who was also David's son, and he was totally in love with Tamar."
2 Samuel,13,2,"Amnon was seriously upset because he had a major crush on his sister Tamar. She was still a virgin, and Amnon believed it was totally impossible to make a move on her. It was like an unfathomable challenge for him."
2 Samuel,13,3,"But Amnon had this homie named Jonadab, who was Shimeah David's bro, and let me tell you, Jonadab was hella smart."
2 Samuel,13,4,"And he was like, dude, why are you, being the king's son, losing weight day after day? Can't you spill the tea to me? And Amnon was like, bro, I'm totally into Tamar, my bro Absalom's sis. Like, every single day I feel this way."
2 Samuel,13,5,"And Jonadab was like, dude, just lie down on your bed and act sick. When your dad comes to check on you, ask him if my sis Tamar can come and bring me some food. Make sure she prepares the food right in front of me, so I can see it and eat it from her hands."
2 Samuel,13,6,"So Amnon was like, totally feeling down and sick, right? And when the king came to check on him, Amnon was all like, 'Yo Dad, can you ask Tamar, my sis, to come over and make me some bomb cakes? I want to eat them while she's making them.'"
2 Samuel,13,7,"So David DM'd Tamar, like, 'Hey, go over to your bro Amnon's crib and whip up some grub for him.'"
2 Samuel,13,8,"So Tamar went over to her brother Amnon's crib, and he was chilling. And she grabbed some flour, and started kneading it to make some lit cakes in front of him, and then she baked 'em. (Flour: or, paste)"
2 Samuel,13,9,"So, she brought a plate and served it in front of him, but he rejected it. Then Amnon cleared the room, commanding everyone to leave."
2 Samuel,13,10,"Amnon was like, 'Hey Tamar, bring me that food so I can chow down.' So Tamar took the cakes she made and brought them to Amnon in his room."
2 Samuel,13,11,"After she presented the food to him, he grabbed her and said, 'Come chill with me, sis, let's share a bed.'"
2 Samuel,13,12,"And she was like, um no, bro, don't even think about it. This kind of stuff is not cool in Israel. Please don't act foolishly like this."
2 Samuel,13,13,"And I, like, where should I even hide my embarrassment? And as for you, you'll be seen as one of those clueless people in Israel. So like, seriously, please talk to the king, 'cause he won't keep me away from you."
2 Samuel,13,14,"But he didn't listen to her, even though he had more power, so he basically forced her and slept with her."
2 Samuel,13,15,"Amnon was, like, super annoyed with her, to the point that his annoyance towards her was even stronger than the love he used to feel for her. And Amnon was all like, 'Yo, get up and leave.'"
2 Samuel,13,16,"And she's like, there's literally no reason for this: the way you're treating me now is even worse than what you did before. But he totally ignores her and won't listen."
2 Samuel,13,17,"So, he hit up his servant who had been helping him out and was like, 'Yo, kick this girl out of here ASAP and make sure you lock the door behind her.'"
2 Samuel,13,18,And she was wearing a super cool outfit with lots of different colors: the kind of clothes that the king's daughters who were still single would wear. Then the servant let her out and locked the door behind her.
2 Samuel,13,19,"So Tamar, like, put ashes on her head and tore her super stylish multicolored garment that she was wearing. She, like, placed her hand on her head and just started crying, like, really loudly."
2 Samuel,13,20,"And Absalom, Tamar's brother, was like, 'Has Amnon, your brother, been with you?' But chill out, sis, he's your brother, so don't even stress about it. So Tamar stayed alone at her bro Absalom's crib. 💔"
2 Samuel,13,21,"But when King David found out about all this, he was seriously pissed off."
2 Samuel,13,22,"So Absalom didn't say anything good or bad to his brother Amnon, because he hated Amnon for what he did to their sister Tamar."
2 Samuel,13,23,"So, like, after waiting for, you know, a legit two whole years, Absalom decided to throw this epic party at Baalhazor, like, near Ephraim and everything. And get this, he invited all the sons of the king."
2 Samuel,13,24,"So Absalom went up to the king and said, 'Yo, peep this, my dude! Your servant's got some mad sheepshearers. It would be pretty lit if you and your homies could roll with us.'"
2 Samuel,13,25,"And the king was like, 'Nah, dude, let's not all go right now. It might be too expensive for you, you know?' But Absalom was persistent, man, like, he really wanted to go. But in the end, he didn't go and the king gave him his blessings."
2 Samuel,13,26,"Absalom was like, 'Hey bro, if my brother Amnon can't roll with us, let's make it happen. But yo, the king was all like, 'Why does he need to come along?'"
2 Samuel,13,27,But Absalom kept insisting that he take Amnon and all the king's sons with him.
2 Samuel,13,28,"So Absalom told his homies, listen up, wait for Amnon to get all lit and drunk, and when I give you the signal, straight up smack him, don't be scared. I'm the boss here, so be brave and show your strength. You got this, my fellow warriors!"
2 Samuel,13,29,"And Absalom's followers did what Absalom told them to do to Amnon. Then all the king's sons got up on their fancy rides and took off. {rode: Hebrew, rode}"
2 Samuel,13,30,"So, like, while they were on the way, David got some news, and it's, like, heavy stuff, bruh. They were like, 'Yo, Absalom straight up killed all of the king's sons, man, not a single one of them survived.'"
2 Samuel,13,31,"So, the king got up, ripped his outfit, and just flopped on the ground. And all of his squad were there, rocking ripped clothes too."
2 Samuel,13,32,"Yo, Jonadab, bro of Shimeah, David's fam, stepped up and was like, 'Hold up, my homie! Don't think all the young dudes, the king's sons, got offed. It was just Amnon who bit the dust. Absalom had it planned since the day he messed with his sister Tamar, you feel me? It was all set in stone, man.'"
2 Samuel,13,33,"Yo, King, don't stress out and think all the king's sons are gone. It's just Amnon who bit the dust."
2 Samuel,13,34,So Absalom basically dipped out. And this dude who was on guard duty looked up and saw a whole bunch of people coming down the hillside from behind.
2 Samuel,13,35,"Yo, King, check it out, the king's sons have arrived, just like your boy Jonadab predicted. He totally called it, man!"
2 Samuel,13,36,"And right after he finished speaking, guess what? The king's sons came and started crying their hearts out, and guess what? The king and all of his servants were crying like crazy too. They were all in tears, big time!"
2 Samuel,13,37,"But Absalom dipped, and slid into Talmai's DMs, the son of Ammihud, ruling the Geshur squad. And {David} legit grieved for his homie every single day. {Ammihud: or, Ammihur}"
2 Samuel,13,38,"Then Absalom dipped, and dipped to Geshur, and chilled there for like three years."
2 Samuel,13,39,"King David really wanted to see Absalom, because he felt a little better now that Amnon was out of the picture. #familydrama"
2 Samuel,14,1,"So Joab, Zeruiah's son, peeped that the king was totally vibing with Absalom."
2 Samuel,14,2,"So Joab got in touch with someone from Tekoah who was known to be wise. He asked her to pretend to be a grieving woman, and told her to dress in mourning clothes and not use any oil on herself, making it seem like she had been mourning for a long time."
2 Samuel,14,3,"And like, go to the king and, you know, talk to him like this. So Joab fed her the right words to say."
2 Samuel,14,4,"So, like, when this woman from Tekoah approached the king, she totally fell on her face to the ground and showed respect, and was like, 'Yo, help me out, O king.' {Help: Hebrew for Save}"
2 Samuel,14,5,"Then the king asked her, 'What's wrong?' And she replied, 'OMG, I'm, like, literally a widow now, because my husband passed away.'"
2 Samuel,14,6,"So, like, this woman, right? She had two sons, and these two dudes were straight up beefing in the field. And, yo, there was nobody around to break it up, so one of ’em went and straight up hit the other guy real hard and, like, killed him. No one was there to stop the drama, you know what I'm saying?"
2 Samuel,14,7,"Yo, listen up. So, check it out, the whole fam is turning against your girl here. They straight up said, Handd over the dude who hit his bro, so we can straight up murk him for takin' a life.' And not only that, they wanna wipe out the heir too. If they do that, my fire will be totally gone, and there won't be a trace of my man left on this earth. For real, fam, it's like they wanna erase him from existence, man."
2 Samuel,14,8,"And the king was like, 'Yo, lady, go back home and I'll take care of everything for you.'"
2 Samuel,14,9,"The woman from Tekoah told the king, 'Yo, my dude, the blame should be on me and my fam, not you and your rule.'"
2 Samuel,14,10,"And the king was like, anyone who tries anything with you, just bring them to me and they won't bother you again."
2 Samuel,14,11,"Then she said, please, King, remember the LORD your God, so that you would prevent any more bloodshed. Don't let the avengers take any more lives, or else they might harm my son. And the king promised, I swear by the LORD's name, not a single hair of your son will be harmed. We won't let the avengers cause more destruction"
2 Samuel,14,12,"So this girl was like, 'Hey, can I like, say something to you, oh mighty king?' And he was all like, 'Sure, go ahead, spill the tea.'"
2 Samuel,14,13,"And the woman was like, dude, why would you even think of doing this terrible thing to God's people? The king is totally acting like he messed up here, 'cause he hasn't brought back his exiled peeps."
2 Samuel,14,14,"We all gotta die, fam, and it's like when you spill water on the ground - you can't reverse it, you know? God doesn't play favorites or show favoritism. But He's got a plan to make sure nobody who's been kicked out of His presence stays away forever. Like, He's got it all figured out, you feel me?"
2 Samuel,14,15,"So, like, I gotta tell my lord the king something, 'cause the people totally scared me. Your girl here was like, 'I'm gonna speak to the king now, maybe he'll do what I ask."
2 Samuel,14,16,"The king's got my back, he'll save me and my son from the evil one who wants to ruin our rightful place in God's plan."
2 Samuel,14,17,"And then I was like, yo king, your words are super lit! You're like an angel from God, knowing what's good and what's whack. So the Lord your God's got your back, fam."
2 Samuel,14,18,"Yo, king dude, don't keep no secrets from me, you feel me? Ask me whatever you wanna know. And the woman said, Go ahead and spill, my king."
2 Samuel,14,19,"The king was like, 'Isn't Joab involved in all of this?' And the woman was like, 'I swear, my lord the king, no one can go against a word you say, because Joab told me to say all this.'"
2 Samuel,14,20,"Your boy Joab did this thing to bring up this topic of conversation, and my lord is hella wise, like an angel of God, knowing everything that's going on in the world."
2 Samuel,14,21,"So the king was like, 'Yo Joab, check it, I just pulled this move. Now, go and bring back that homie Absalom.'"
2 Samuel,14,22,"And Joab straight up dropped to the ground, face planted, and respectfully bowed down to show his gratitude to the king. Joab said, 'Today I fully realize that I'm totally in your good books, my lord, O king, because you totally came through and granted your servant's request.'"
2 Samuel,14,23,"So Joab was like, 'I'm out,' and went to Geshur to find Absalom and bring him back to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,14,24,"And the king was like, 'Go back to your crib, don't even bother lookin' at me.' So Absalom went back to his place, never laid eyes on the king."
2 Samuel,14,25,"But among all of Israel, no one was as praised as Absalom for his good looks. Seriously, this dude was flawless from head to toe, not a single imperfection. People couldn't help but admire him, trust me."
2 Samuel,14,26,"And like, at the end of each year, he would totally trim his hair, 'cause it was getting too heavy, you know? So he trimmed it, and it ended up weighing 200 shekels. That's like, the official king's weight and all."
2 Samuel,14,27,Absalom had three sons and one daughter named Tamar who was really good-looking.
2 Samuel,14,28,"Absalom stayed in Jerusalem for a solid two years, but never got to hang with the king."
2 Samuel,14,29,"So Absalom hit up Joab, asking him to link up with the king, but Joab was like nah, not feeling it. And when Absalom hit him up a second time, Joab still wasn't down."
2 Samuel,14,30,"So he told his homies, yo, check it - Joab's plot is right next to mine, and dude's got hella barley there. Bet, go ahead and light that thing up. And Absalom's squad went and straight torched Joab's field."
2 Samuel,14,31,"So Joab gets up and goes to Absalom's crib and asks him, 'Yo, why did your homies burn down my turf?'"
2 Samuel,14,32,"Absalom replied to Joab, like dude, I texted you to come over here so that I could send you to the king and be like, 'Yo, why did I even come back from Geshur? It was so chill over there.' So now let me see the king and if there's any wrong I've done, I'm ready to face the consequences, man."
2 Samuel,14,33,"Then Joab went to the king and told him. And when the king summoned Absalom, he appeared before the king, humbly bowing down before him. The king then embraced and kissed Absalom."
2 Samuel,15,1,"And then, like, after all that went down, Absalom totally got himself some sick rides and horses, and he had, like, a squad of fifty dudes to flex and run ahead of him."
2 Samuel,15,2,"So Absalom woke up early and positioned himself by the gate. Whenever someone came to the king with a dispute, Absalom would call out to them and ask where they were from. They would reply, saying they were from one of the Israelite tribes."
2 Samuel,15,3,"And Absalom was like, yo dude, I hear ya, your stuff is legit and valid; but it's whack that no one from the king's crew is here to listen to you. Like, nobody is giving you the time of day, from the top down."
2 Samuel,15,4,"Absalom was like, yo, I wish I could be the judge of the whole land and be there for everyone who needs help and give them the justice they deserve, you know?"
2 Samuel,15,5,"So, like, whenever someone approached him to show respect, he reached out his hand, pulled them close, and gave them a friendly kiss."
2 Samuel,15,6,So this is how Absalom played all of Israel who came seeking judgment from the king: he totally won over the hearts of the people.
2 Samuel,15,7,"After like forty years, Absalom was all like, 'Yo, King! Can I dip and fulfill this promise I made to the LORD in Hebron?"
2 Samuel,15,8,"When I was chilling in Geshur, Syria, I made a big promise. I was like, yo, if God brings me back to Jerusalem, then I'm totally gonna serve Him."
2 Samuel,15,9,"And the king was like, 'You can go in peace, my dude.' So the guy got up and headed to Hebron."
2 Samuel,15,10,"So Absalom, being a total secret agent, sent his crew to scope out all the tribes of Israel. He instructed them, like, 'Once you catch wind of that trumpet sound, make sure you spread the word that Absalom is taking over in Hebron.'"
2 Samuel,15,11,"And Absalom took along two hundred dudes from Jerusalem, who were pretty clueless and didn't know what was going on."
2 Samuel,15,12,"So Absalom hit up Ahithophel, David's main advisor, from his hometown Giloh, right when he was making sacrifices. And damn, the conspiracy grew stronger 'cause Absalom was gaining more and more followers."
2 Samuel,15,13,"Yo, someone hit up David with a message. They're like, 'Bruh, all the homies in Israel are totally team Absalom.'"
2 Samuel,15,14,"So David said to all his homies in Jerusalem, Yo, let's bounce! We gotta dip ASAP 'cause Absalom's on our tail. Hurry up and dip before he catches us off guard and wreaks havoc on us, straight up slashing the city with his sword. No cap."
2 Samuel,15,15,"And the king's peeps were like, 'Yo king, we're down to do whatever you want, just let us know!'"
2 Samuel,15,16,"So the king was like, 'Let's do this!' and everyone in his crew tagged along. But he had like ten side chicks, you know, concubines, to take care of the crib. They stayed back and held it down. #priorities"
2 Samuel,15,17,"So the king dipped, and everyone followed him, chilling in a lit spot that was hella far away."
2 Samuel,15,18,"And all his squad rolled up with him; the whole squad, including the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and the Gittites - a crew of six hundred dudes who came from Gath - they all rolled out in front of the king."
2 Samuel,15,19,"The king was like, 'Yo, Ittai the Gittite, why are you rolling with us? Go back to your spot and chill with the king, man. 'Cause you're a foreigner, and also an exile.'"
2 Samuel,15,20,"Dude, you just arrived yesterday. Am I seriously supposed to let you wander around with us today? I'm going wherever I want to go, so you should just go back home and take your friends with you. May mercy and truth be with you."
2 Samuel,15,21,"And Ittai was like, yo king, swear to the Lord and swear on your life, wherever you go, whether you're dead or alive, your boy Ittai will be right there with you."
2 Samuel,15,22,"So like, David was all like, 'Yo, Ittai, go ahead and cross over, man.' And Ittai the Gittite straight up crossed over with all his homies, even the little ones who were chilling with him."
2 Samuel,15,23,"Everyone in the whole land was crying loudly, and all the people crossed over. Even the king himself crossed over the brook called Kidron, and all the people crossed over, heading towards the wilderness."
2 Samuel,15,24,"And like, dude, Zadok and all the Levites, they were totally vibing with him, carrying the ark of God's pact. So they put down the ark of God, and Abiathar went up until all the people had finished leaving the city, you know?"
2 Samuel,15,25,"And the king was like, 'Yo Zadok, take the ark of God back to the city. If the LORD thinks I'm cool, He'll bring me back and show me both the ark and His place.'"
2 Samuel,15,26,"But if he's like, 'I'm not into you anymore,' then, like, here I am, let him do whatever he wants with me."
2 Samuel,15,27,"The king was like, 'Bro, aren't you, like, a seer? Go back to the city with peace vibes, and take your two sons with you, Ahimaaz and Jonathan, son of Abiathar.'"
2 Samuel,15,28,"Yo, I'm gonna chill in the wild until you hit me up with some updates, ya know?"
2 Samuel,15,29,"So, Zadok and Abiathar brought the ark of God back to Jerusalem and they stayed there."
2 Samuel,15,30,"So David went up the hill of Olivet, and he was really sad and crying. He covered his head and walked without shoes. All the people who were with him also covered their heads and cried as they walked up the hill."
2 Samuel,15,31,"So, someone came up to David and told him, 'Hey, just so you know, Ahithophel is part of Absalom's little group of people planning against you.' And David was like, 'Oh Lord, I really hope you can do something about that. Can you just make Ahithophel's advice look totally stupid, please? Thanks.'"
2 Samuel,15,32,"So, like, David reached the absolute peak of the mountain where he was like in total worship mode, right? And out of nowhere, this dude named Hushai the Archite shows up, looking all messed up with his clothes ripped and dirt all over his head, you know?"
2 Samuel,15,33,"David's like, if you roll with me, bro, you'll just slow me down, man."
2 Samuel,15,34,"But like, if you go back to the city and tell Absalom that you wanna be his servant, dude, like as a loyal AF servant to your dad till now, so from now on, I'll totally be your servant too. Then you can count on me to help you outsmart Ahithophel's advice and stuff."
2 Samuel,15,35,"Hey, do you have Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you right now? If so, here's the deal: whatever information you get from the king's house, make sure you share it with Zadok and Abiathar ASAP."
2 Samuel,15,36,"Yo, check it out, they've got their two sons with them: Ahimaaz, Zadok's kid, and Jonathan, Abiathar's kid. Send them to me with any info you can gather."
2 Samuel,15,37,"Then Hushai, David's homie, pulled up in the city, while Absalom rolled into Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,16,1,"And like, when David was just chillin' and almost at the top of the hill, he ran into Ziba, who was Mephibosheth's servant. Ziba had a couple of donkeys all saddled up and carrying two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred bunches of raisins, a hundred summer fruits, and a bottle of wine, ya know."
2 Samuel,16,2,"The king was like, 'Yo, Ziba, what's the deal with all this stuff?' And Ziba was like, 'Well, these donkeys are for the king's squad to ride fancy on, and the bread and fruit are for the young dudes to snack on, and we got some wine for those who feel weak in the wild.'"
2 Samuel,16,3,"So the king asked, where's your master's son at? And Ziba replied to the king, yo, he's chillin' in Jerusalem. He's all like, today the house of Israel gonna hook me up with my dad's kingdom back."
2 Samuel,16,4,"Then the king was like, 'Yo, Ziba, check it out, everything that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours.' And Ziba was like, 'Yo, please let me find favor in your eyes, my lord, oh king. I'm all humble and stuff.'"
2 Samuel,16,5,"So, like, when King David pulled up in Bahurim, this dude Shimei, who was from the fam of Saul, straight up came out and started cussing him out, nonstop. No chill whatsoever, just kept at it."
2 Samuel,16,6,"Then he threw rocks at David and all of King David's crew: and everyone, including the badass warriors, were standing with him on both sides."
2 Samuel,16,7,"And this is what Shimei said when he was cursing: 'Yo, step up, step up, you violent dude, you straight up troublemaker, bro!'"
2 Samuel,16,8,"OMG, the Lord is totally getting back at you for the bloodshed during Saul's reign. Absalom, your own son, has now taken over the kingdom, and you are literally caught up in your own misfortune because of your violent ways. Seriously, dude, this is some messed up karma coming your way."
2 Samuel,16,9,"Abishai, son of Zeruiah, was like, 'Yo, why this dead dog gotta diss my king? Let me handle this and chop off his head for you, fam.'"
2 Samuel,16,10,"And the king was like, why should I even bother with you, you sons of Zeruiah? If the LORD told him to curse David, then let him curse. Who's gonna question why he did it?"
2 Samuel,16,11,"Yo, check it. My own flesh and blood, my son, is out here tryna take me down. And this Benjamite? Bet he's got even more motivation. Just leave him be, let him talk smack. The big man upstairs told him to do it anyway."
2 Samuel,16,12,"Maybe the LORD will peep my struggles and give me some good karma for all the hate He's getting today. {struggles: or, shedding tears: Hebrew, eye}"
2 Samuel,16,13,"So, like, David and his crew were just chilling, walking down the road, right? And out of nowhere, Shimei shows up, being all edgy and stuff, walking on the side of the hill like he's so cool. But here's the kicker - this dude starts swearing at David, throws freaking stones at him, and even goes all dramatic and throws dust in his face. Like, seriously? Who does that?"
2 Samuel,16,14,"And the king, and all the squad that was vibin' with him, rolled up tired AF, and found some chill to recharge themselves there."
2 Samuel,16,15,"So Absalom and all the guys from Israel pulled up to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was rolling with them."
2 Samuel,16,16,"So, when Hushai the Archite, David's homie, went to Absalom, he said to Absalom, 'Long live the king, long live the king.'"
2 Samuel,16,17,"And Absalom was like, 'Yo, Hushai, is this how you treat your homie? Why didn't you roll with your homie?'}"
2 Samuel,16,18,"And Hushai was like, no way dude; I'm totally sticking with whoever the LORD, the peeps, and all the guys from Israel pick, that's who I'm rollin' with!"
2 Samuel,16,19,"And like, who am I supposed to serve? Like, shouldn't I serve in front of his son too? I mean, I've totally served in your dad's presence, so I'm gonna do the same in your presence, dude."
2 Samuel,16,20,"So Absalom was like, 'Yo Ahithophel, let's brainstorm some lit ideas on what moves we should make.'"
2 Samuel,16,21,"And Ahithophel was like, 'Yo Absalom, you should totally hook up with your dad's concubines that he left behind to take care of the house. That'll show everyone that your dad disapproves of you, and it will give a power boost to all your followers.'"
2 Samuel,16,22,"So, like, they set up this sick tent for Absalom on the roof, and Absalom straight up went and hooked up with his dad's side chicks in front of everyone in Israel."
2 Samuel,16,23,"And Ahithophel's advice during that time was like seeking guidance from God himself. Both David and Absalom valued and followed Ahithophel's counsel, considering it as wise as seeking divine revelation."
2 Samuel,17,1,"So Ahithophel was like, 'Yo, Absalom, let me pick twelve thousand homies, and I'll go after David tonight'"
2 Samuel,17,2,"And I'll totally catch him off guard when he's already tired and has zero energy, and I'll scare the heck out of him. All his buddies will run away for sure, and I'll totally take down the king, like BOOM!"
2 Samuel,17,3,"And I'll totally gather all the peeps for you, bro: the dude you're looking for will be, like, everyone's back in the squad, fam. So, like, all the people will be chill and peaceful."
2 Samuel,17,4,"And Absalom thought this was really cool, and all the older peeps in Israel were on board with it. {thought...: Lit. it was right in the eyes of, etc}"
2 Samuel,17,5,"Absalom was like, 'Yo, bring Hushai the Archite over here, we wanna hear what he's gotta say too. Like, spill it, bro.'"
2 Samuel,17,6,"So, when Hushai arrived to see Absalom, he said to him, 'Dude, Ahithophel just said something pretty intense. Should we actually go ahead and do what he suggested? If not, speak up and share your thoughts.'"
2 Samuel,17,7,"Yo, Absalom, check it. The advice Ahithophel spit ain't on point right now, believe me. #NotFeelinIt #ThinkTwice"
2 Samuel,17,8,"So, Hushai was like, 'You know your dad and his crew, right? They're straight up tough warriors, always on edge like a mama bear robbed of her cubs in the wild. Your dad is a fierce soldier, he's not gonna chill out with the common folk. You feel me?'"
2 Samuel,17,9,"Look, he's probably hiding somewhere, like in some secret spot or something. And you know what's gonna happen? As soon as a few of them go down, everyone who hears about it will be like, 'Dude, there's a total massacre going on with Absalom's crew.'"
2 Samuel,17,10,"And even those who are brave and fearless, with hearts as courageous as a lion's, shall be greatly moved: for all of Israel recognizes the power and strength of your father, and the valiant warriors who stand by his side."
2 Samuel,17,11,"So here's the plan: I suggest you gather all of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, like a ton of sand on the beach - that's how many people we need. And then, to make it even more epic, you gotta lead the charge in battle yourself. You know, show off your amazing presence and all that. Let's do this!"
2 Samuel,17,12,"We'll totally catch him off guard wherever we find him, like dew coming down on the ground. Not a single one of him or his crew will escape our grasp, zero chance."
2 Samuel,17,13,"Also, if he manages to escape into a city, all the people of Israel will gather ropes and we'll pull that city into the river until there isn't even a tiny stone left."
2 Samuel,17,14,"So Absalom and all the dudes from Israel were like, 'Yo, Hushai the Archite's advice is way better than Ahithophel's! It's straight up divine intervention, man. The LORD made sure that Ahithophel's good advice would fail, just to bring some bad vibes upon Absalom."
2 Samuel,17,15,"So Hushai went to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, and told them what advice Ahithophel gave to Absalom and the leaders of Israel. He shared his own counsel as well, saying the same things."
2 Samuel,17,16,"So like, send a quick message to David and be like, 'Dude, don't crash in the boring wilderness tonight. Cross it ASAP! Otherwise, the king and everyone with him might get totally wrecked.'"
2 Samuel,17,17,"So Jonathan and Ahimaaz chilled by Enrogel, because they didn't wanna get caught entering the city. Then this girl slid into their DMs and spilled the tea to them, and they slid into King David's DMs and shared the info."
2 Samuel,17,18,"But then a dude saw it and told Absalom. And like, without wasting any time, they both bounced and went to some guy's crib in Bahurim. And this dude had a sick well in his yard, so they dipped down into it."
2 Samuel,17,19,"Then the woman grabbed a sheet and covered the opening of the well. She sprinkled some corn meal on it, and nobody found out what she did."
2 Samuel,17,20,"And like, when Absalom's friends came to the lady's crib, they were all, 'Yo, where's Ahimaaz and Jonathan at?' And she was like, 'Oh, they dipped to the other side of the water stream, fam.' So they searched for them, but couldn't find them, so they went back to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,17,21,"So, like, after they left, they like climbed out of this well and went to tell King David. They were all like, 'Yo David, wake up and move fast across the water, because Ahithophel is totally plotting against you!'"
2 Samuel,17,22,"So David got up, and all his crew rolled out too, and they crossed over the Jordan River. And guess what? When morning came, not a single one of them had stayed behind on the other side of the river. All squad goals achieved!"
2 Samuel,17,23,"And when Ahithophel realized that no one listened to his advice, he quickly packed up, hopped on his ride, went back home to his city, organized his household affairs, sadly took his own life, and was laid to rest in his father's burial place."
2 Samuel,17,24,"So David pulled up to Mahanaim, and Absalom and the whole squad of Israel crossed the Jordan with him."
2 Samuel,17,25,"Yo, Absalom be like, 'Amasa gonna be the new captain of the crew instead of Joab.' Amasa was the son of some dude named Ithra, who was straight up Israeli. And get this, he even hooked up with Abigail, Nahash's daughter, who's Zeruiah's sister - Joab's mom. (BTW, Ithra might also be called Jether, and Nahash is also known as Jesse, you feel?)"
2 Samuel,17,26,So Israel and Absalom were like staying in the land of Gilead.
2 Samuel,17,27,"So, like, when David arrived at Mahanaim, there were these dudes named Shobi (Nahash's son from Rabbah of the Ammonites), Machir (Ammiel's son from Lodebar), and Barzillai (the Gileadite from Rogelim) there too."
2 Samuel,17,28,"Brought some cool stuff like beds, bowls, clay jars, wheat, barley, flour, toasted corn, beans, lentils, and toasted seeds. (By the way, 'basons' actually means cups!)"
2 Samuel,17,29,"And they brought honey, and butter, and sheep, and cow cheese for David and his squad to feast on because they were all starving, exhausted, and thirsty in the middle of nowhere."
2 Samuel,18,1,"So David counted all the people rolled up with him, and appointed leaders with swag over squads of thousands and squads of hundreds."
2 Samuel,18,2,"So David split the people into three groups. One group was led by Joab, another by Abishai (Joab's brother), and the third by Ittai the Gittite. The king himself even said, 'I'm definitely coming along with you guys too.'"
2 Samuel,18,3,"But the squad replied, like, you can't bounce. If we dip, they won't even give a dang about us. And even if half of us bite the dust, they still won't care. But you, bro, you're worth, like, ten thousand of us. So it's way better if you save us and get us out of this place."
2 Samuel,18,4,"And the king was like, 'So, fam, what do y'all think I should do?' And he posted up by the gate, and all the people came out in big numbers, like hundreds and thousands."
2 Samuel,18,5,"The king was like, 'Hey Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, I need you to handle Absalom with care - like, be gentle with the dude. And everyone was listening when the king laid down the law to all the captains about Absalom."
2 Samuel,18,6,"So, like, these peeps came at Israel in the field, and the battle went down in the wood of Ephraim, ya know."
2 Samuel,18,7,"So like, the Israelites got all wrecked by David's crew, and yo, it was a massive beatdown with like, twenty thousand dudes down for the count that day."
2 Samuel,18,8,"Yo, the battle was crazy, spread out all over the place. But yo, the forest, it straight up wrecked more people that day than the sword did. Like, it went on a munching spree, you feel me?"
2 Samuel,18,9,"So Absalom came across some of David's servants. And Absalom was riding on a cool mule, the mule went under some big oak tree branches, and Absalom's head got stuck in the oak. He ended up dangling between the sky and the ground while the mule he was riding ran off."
2 Samuel,18,10,"So there was this guy who spotted it and he totally let Joab know, like, 'Yo, check it out, man! I saw Absalom hanging from this oak!'"
2 Samuel,18,11,"Joab was like, 'Dude, you saw him and you didn't take him down? Seriously, you could've scored ten shekels of silver and a rad girdle.'"
2 Samuel,18,12,"And the dude said to Joab, even if I got a thousand bucks in my hand, I still wouldn't lay a finger on the king's son. 'Cause we all heard the king warn you, Abishai, and Ittai, and tell you to be careful not to harm young Absalom."
2 Samuel,18,13,"If I did that, I would be lying to myself and that's a major L for me. 'Cause, like, the king knows everything, no secrets. And you, dude, would totally be opposing me."
2 Samuel,18,14,"Joab was like, 'Yo, I can't just chill here forever.' So he grabs three darts and straight up stabs them into Absalom's heart while he's still breathing, right in the middle of this oak tree."
2 Samuel,18,15,"Then ten dudes with Joab's swaggy armor surrounded Absalom and totally wrecked him, taking him out!"
2 Samuel,18,16,"Then Joab blasted the trumpet, and the squad dipped out from chasing Israel 'cause Joab got 'em to back off."
2 Samuel,18,17,"So they captured Absalom and threw him into a massive pit in the woods, piling up a bunch of huge rocks on top of him. Then all the people of Israel scattered and went back to their own tents."
2 Samuel,18,18,"Back in the day, Absalom decided to flex and built this huge pillar in the king's dale, you know? He was like, 'Yo, I don't have a son to carry on my name, so let's make sure people never forget me!' That's why he named the pillar after himself, and everyone still calls it Absalom's place even now."
2 Samuel,18,19,"So Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, was like 'Yo, let me bounce and tell the king the good news that the LORD totally wrecked his enemies, like, super judged them and stuff. #straightup"
2 Samuel,18,20,"And Joab was like, 'Dude, not today. Take a raincheck on delivering news. The king's son passed away, man. Give it a rest for now.'"
2 Samuel,18,21,"So Joab said to Cushi, 'Yo, go tell the king what you just peeped. And Cushi bowed down to Joab, then dipped out in a hurry.'"
2 Samuel,18,22,"So Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, asked Joab again, dude, can I also chase after Cushi? And Joab was like, bro, why would you run when you have no news to deliver yet?"
2 Samuel,18,23,"But dude, listen, let me go for it. And he's like, 'Go for it, man!' So Ahimaaz bolts through the open field and zooms right past Cushi."
2 Samuel,18,24,"So, like, David was chilling between the two gates, right? And then this watchman dude goes up to the roof over the gate and checks it out, you know? He looks up and sees this dude running all by himself."
2 Samuel,18,25,"Then the lookout dude yelled out and told the king what was up. And the king was like, 'If he's all by himself, he's probs got some news to spill.' So the guy hurried over and got closer."
2 Samuel,18,26,"The lookout spotted another dude sprinting, so he hollered at the gatekeeper, like, 'Yo, check it out, there's this one dude running all by himself.' And the king was like, Wordd, he must be bringing some important news or something.'"
2 Samuel,18,27,"The watchman was like, dude, the guy in front is totally running like Ahimaaz, Zadok's son. And the king was like, yeah, he's legit and probably bringing some awesome news. (By the way, when the watchman said 'I see the running', he meant 'I totally noticed how fast he's running')."
2 Samuel,18,28,"And Ahimaaz called out to the king and said, 'Everything is good, man.' And he fell down on the ground, face to the floor, in front of the king, and said, Praisee the Lord your God, who totally took care of those dudes who dared to mess with you, man.'"
2 Samuel,18,29,"And the king was like, yo, is Absalom doing okay, bro? And Ahimaaz was like, well, when Joab sent the king's servant and also ya boy me, I saw mad chaos, but I had no clue what was going down. Was it all good, tho?"
2 Samuel,18,30,"And the king's like, 'Yo, you, step aside and chill. So dude steps aside and just stays put."
2 Samuel,18,31,"Yo, listen up! Cushi just rolled in and he's like, 'Yo, my lord the king, I got some big news! The LORD totally took revenge for you today on all those haters who were against you. Like, seriously, it's lit! #Tidings #BossMoves"
2 Samuel,18,32,"The king was like, yo Cushi, is young Absalom chillin' alright? And Cushi was like, don't trip my lord, any fools tryin' to bring you down be just as shut down as Absalom, man."
2 Samuel,18,33,"The king was so emotional, he went up to the room above the gate and cried his heart out. While he was walking, he kept repeating, 'Oh, my dude Absalom, my bro, my homie Absalom! I wish I could've taken your place, dude, oh Absalom, my bro, my homie!'"
2 Samuel,19,1,"Yo, Joab got some news, like, the king's totally crying and grieving over Absalom."
2 Samuel,19,2,And that epic win that day quickly became a total downer for everyone: because word got around that day about how devastated the king was when he heard that his son had passed away. (victory: in Hebrew it means salvation or deliverance)
2 Samuel,19,3,"So, like, the people sneaked into the city on the down-low that day, you know? Kinda like when you're feeling embarrassed or whatever and you discreetly slip away during a chaotic fight."
2 Samuel,19,4,"But then the king, like, hid his face and just broke down, shouting at the top of his lungs, like, 'Oh my dude Absalom! Absalom, bro, my son, my son!'"
2 Samuel,19,5,"Yo, Joab pulled up to the king's crib and straight up told him, bro, you made all your homies feel embarrassed and disrespected today. Like, we literally risked our lives to save you, your kids, your wives, and even your side pieces, man."
2 Samuel,19,6,"You're like, totally loving your haters while hating on your squad, man. Like, you're not even caring whether they're famous or just regular peeps. It's like, today you're showing that if Absalom was alive and the rest of us were gone, you'd be totally stoked. #bylovingyourhaters #noprinceorservantneeded"
2 Samuel,19,7,"So, like, get up, go out there, and like, speak in a way that brings good vibes to your crew. Seriously, I promise by the LORD, if you don't go out there, you'll be all alone tonight, and that's gonna be way worse for you than any bad stuff that's ever happened to you before. {comfortably...: Haha, I mean, speak straight to the heart of your peeps}"
2 Samuel,19,8,"So, the king got up and chilled near the entrance. And word got out to everyone like, 'Yo, check it out, the king's posted up at the entrance.' And all the folks gathered 'round the king 'cause everyone in Israel had gone back to their own tents."
2 Samuel,19,9,"And everyone was so shook, I mean like legit fighting and arguing all over Israel, like OMG. They were like, 'Dude, the king totally saved us from our enemies and the Philistines, you know? And now he just straight up dipped out of the country because of Absalom.'"
2 Samuel,19,10,"Hey y'all, just a heads up, Absalom, the dude we voted to be our leader, he's like, totally dead from a crazy battle. So like, why aren't we even talking about bringing the king back? Like, seriously, why is everyone being so quiet about it? #BringBackTheKing"
2 Samuel,19,11,"King David hit up Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, and was all like, 'Yo, spread the word to the old heads in Judah. Like, why y'all takin' so long to bring the king back home? Everyone in Israel is already with him and stuff, right at his crib.'"
2 Samuel,19,12,"You guys, we're like family, legit! So why are you slacking and being slow to bring the king back?"
2 Samuel,19,13,"Yo, Amasa, bro, are you not like, my fam? I swear on everything, if you don't become the main leader of my crew instead of Joab, may God punish me big time and even more."
2 Samuel,19,14,"And he totally united all the guys from Judah, like they were all on the same page; they hit up the king saying, 'Yo, come back with all your crew.'"
2 Samuel,19,15,So the king came back and headed to Jordan. And Judah met up at Gilgal to welcome the king and escort him across the Jordan.
2 Samuel,19,16,"So this dude named Shimei, son of Gera, who's from Benjamite crew, straight up rushed down from Bahurim to link up with the squad of Judah and meet up with king David."
2 Samuel,19,17,"And like, there were, like, a thousand dudes from Benjamin rollin' with him, and also Ziba, who was, like, Saul's servant, and also his fifteen sons and his twenty other servants were there too. And they all, like, crossed the Jordan River before the king."
2 Samuel,19,18,"So this ferry boat rolls up to transport the king's crew and help him do his thing. As soon as King David crosses the Jordan, Shimei, son of Gera, bows down before him like, 'Sup, dude?'"
2 Samuel,19,19,"And I told the king, Please don't blame me for my mistakes, and don't dwell on the dumb stuff I did when you left Jerusalem. Don't let it bother you, king."
2 Samuel,19,20,"Okay, so your boy here knows that I messed up, no cap. That's why I'm the first one from the squad repping Joseph's crib to come through and meet up with my main man, the king."
2 Samuel,19,21,"Yo, Abishai, Zeruiah’s son, was like, 'Can't we just straight up slay Shimei for disrespecting the anointed of the LORD?'"
2 Samuel,19,22,"So, like, David was all like, 'Yo, why are you, sons of Zeruiah, trying to be my enemies today? Are we really gonna kill someone in Israel today? I mean, come on, guys, I'm the king of Israel, don't forget!"
2 Samuel,19,23,"So the king was like, 'Yo Shimei, you ain't gonna die, man. And the king was like, 'Swear, bro.'"
2 Samuel,19,24,"So Mephibosheth, Saul's son, went up to the king and he didn't even bother to freshen up his look – didn't dress his feet, trim his beard, or wash his clothes – from the day the king left until the day he returned safely."
2 Samuel,19,25,"So, like, when he finally arrived in Jerusalem to see the king, the king was like, 'Dude, why didn't you come with me, Mephibosheth?'"
2 Samuel,19,26,"And he was like, yo king, my servant totally played me. I was like, I'm gonna hop on this donkey and roll over to see you, but dude, I'm hella lame."
2 Samuel,19,27,"And he's totally talked smack about your boy to the king, but the king is legit like an angel from heaven: so do whatever you think is cool, dude."
2 Samuel,19,28,"Dude, everyone from my dad's crew were basically toast in front of you, the king. But you still chose to let me hang with the cool kids at your table. So, like, why should I even bother crying to the king anymore? They were all as good as done for, ya know?"
2 Samuel,19,29,"And the king was like, why are you still talking about your stuff? I already told you, you and Ziba gotta split the land."
2 Samuel,19,30,"And Mephibosheth was like, 'Totally, let him have it all. My dude the king is back home safe and sound.'"
2 Samuel,19,31,"So Barzillai, from Gilead, came down from Rogelim and crossed the Jordan River with the king to help him get across safely."
2 Samuel,19,32,"Barzillai was, like, super old, around eighty years old or whatever, and he totally hooked up the king with food while he was chillin' in Mahanaim. Like, this dude was a total legend."
2 Samuel,19,33,"And the king was like, 'Hey Barzillai, come chill with me in Jerusalem and I'll hook you up with some dope food.'"
2 Samuel,19,34,"And Barzillai was like, yo, king, how much time do I have left? Like, should I even roll with you to Jerusalem?"
2 Samuel,19,35,"Yo, I'm eighty years old today. Can't your boy here tell the difference between right and wrong? Can I even enjoy my food and drinks anymore? Don't even get me started on my ability to hear singing voices. So why should I continue being a burden to you, my king?"
2 Samuel,19,36,"Your boy/girl gonna roll for a bit across the Jordan River with the king, but why should the king hook me up with such a sick reward?"
2 Samuel,19,37,"Hey, please let me go back to my hometown so I can pass away there and be buried alongside my parents. But, check it out, let your homie Chimham roll with you, king, and do whatever you think is best for him."
2 Samuel,19,38,"The king was like, 'Chimham, you can totally come with me. I'll treat you however you want me to, and I'll do anything you ask of me.'"
2 Samuel,19,39,"So, like, everyone crossed the Jordan River, ya know? And when the king made it across, he gave Barzillai a smooch, and, like, blessed him and stuff. Then Barzillai went back to his own crib."
2 Samuel,19,40,"Then the king rolled up to Gilgal with Chimham in tow, and all the Judah squad escorted the king, along with half of Israel's crew. #SquadGoals #Gilgal #KingTime"
2 Samuel,19,41,"So, like, all the dudes from Israel came to the king and were all like, yo dude, why did our bros from Judah snatch you up and bring you, your fam, and all of David's peeps with you across the Jordan river?"
2 Samuel,19,42,"And all the Judah peeps were like, yo, to the Israel fam, chillax! The king's like fam to us. So why you trippin' over this? Did we even cop a bite from the king's grub? Or did he hook us up with any swag?"
2 Samuel,19,43,"Yo, the Israel dudes spoke up to the Judah dudes and were like, 'Bro, we're like ten times more connected to the king and we're even more loyal to David than you! So why did you diss us and not consider our advice when it came to bringing back our king?' And let me tell you, the words coming out of the Judah guys' mouths were even more intense than what the Israel guys said. They straight up disrespected us, man."
2 Samuel,20,1,"And there was this dude named Sheba, the son of Bichri, from the tribe of Benjamin, and he was totally shady. He starts causing some drama by blowing a trumpet and declaring that we ain't down with David or Jesse's son anymore. He's like, 'Alright everyone, time to split and go back to our own tents, Israel! No more loyalty here.'"
2 Samuel,20,2,"So, like, all the guys from Israel, they ditched David and started following this dude named Sheba, son of Bichri. But the dudes from Judah stayed loyal to their king, from Jordan all the way to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,20,3,"And David went back to his crib in Jerusalem; and the king gathered his ten side chicks, who he had left to hold down the fort, and put them on lockdown, providing for them but not getting busy with them. So they were kept locked up until they died, living their lives as widows."
2 Samuel,20,4,"So the king was like, yo Amasa, gather up the squad from Judah in three days, and make sure you're here too. {Gather up: Heb. Call}"
2 Samuel,20,5,"So Amasa went to gather the crew from Judah, but he took longer than the expected time he had given him. (Gather: Hebrew - Call)"
2 Samuel,20,6,"Yo, Abishai, listen up, Sheba, Bichri's kid, is gonna cause us even more trouble than Absalom did. Round up your crew, take the squad from the king, and chase after him. We can't let him find a safe haven in some fortified cities and slip away from our grasp."
2 Samuel,20,7,"So, Joab's squad, along with the Cherethites, Pelethites, and all the powerful warriors, hit the road from Jerusalem to chase Sheba, Bichri's son!"
2 Samuel,20,8,"When they arrived at the awesome stone in Gibeon, Amasa took the lead. And Joab's outfit, which he had put on, was cinched around him with a stylish belt, with a sword attached to it hanging on his waist, safely tucked in its sheath. But as he walked, it suddenly slipped out."
2 Samuel,20,9,"Yo Joab was like, 'Yo Amasa, how you doing, bro?' And then Joab grabbed Amasa's beard with his right hand to give him a bro hug."
2 Samuel,20,10,"But Amasa completely overlooked the fact that Joab had a sword in his hand, so Joab used it to strike him in the side, causing his bowels to spill out onto the ground. However, Joab didn't strike him again; his one blow was enough to kill Amasa. After that, Joab and his brother Abishai continued their pursuit of Sheba, son of Bichri. (Additional note: Joab intentionally didn't strike him again with full force)"
2 Samuel,20,11,"So basically, this dude from Joab's crew spoke up and was like, 'If you're all about Joab or you're Team David, then you better go roll with Joab, okay?'"
2 Samuel,20,12,"And Amasa was covered in blood on the road. When people saw that, they all stopped in their tracks. One guy moved Amasa off the road and onto the grassy field, then covered him with a cloth so that everyone passing by would pause as well."
2 Samuel,20,13,"Once he was taken off the road, everyone followed Joab and went after Sheba, Bichri's son."
2 Samuel,20,14,"And he traveled to all the tribes of Israel, including Abel, Bethmaachah, and the Berites. They all gathered together and followed him too."
2 Samuel,20,15,"So basically, they surrounded him in Abel of Bethmaachah and even built a barricade to attack the city. It was like a showdown! Joab and his crew relentlessly attacked the wall, trying to bring it down. They were going all out, no holding back."
2 Samuel,20,16,"So this super smart woman from the city was like, 'Hey, listen up! Can you please tell Joab to come over here? I really need to chat with him.'"
2 Samuel,20,17,"And when he approached her, the woman asked, 'Are you Joab?' And he replied, 'Yes, it's me.' Then she said to him, 'Listen to what your servant has to say.' And he responded, 'I'm listening.'"
2 Samuel,20,18,"So she said, like back in the day people used to say that they would totally seek advice from Abel, and that would settle things, you know. They were like, 'Let's just ask Abel and that'll be it.'"
2 Samuel,20,19,I'm one of the chill and loyal ones in Israel: you're trying to wreck a city and a major figure in Israel: why would you mess with what God gave us?
2 Samuel,20,20,"And Joab was like, no way, no way dude, I would never, ever, even think about swallowing up or destroying anything, no chance."
2 Samuel,20,21,"Like, this situation is totally not cool, dude. So there's this guy named Sheba, from Mount Ephraim, and he straight up decided to rebel against the king, David. If you hand him over to us, we'll peace out of your city, no problemo. And check it, the woman was like, 'Hey Joab, we'll toss his head over the wall to you, no biggie.'"
2 Samuel,20,22,"So, the woman went to everyone, being really smart about it. And they totally got rid of Sheba, son of Bichri, by cutting off his head and throwing it to Joab. Then Joab, like, blew a trumpet and everybody just scattered from the city and went back to their tents. Joab went back to Jerusalem to see the king."
2 Samuel,20,23,"So Joab was basically in charge of all the guys in Israel, and Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, was the boss of the Cherethites and the Pelethites."
2 Samuel,20,24,"Adoram was in charge of collecting taxes, and Jehoshaphat, Ahilud's son, was the guy who kept records and remembered important stuff."
2 Samuel,20,25,"And Sheva was like the ultimate scribe, you know, top-notch in recording everything. Zadok and Abiathar were holding it down as the priests, doing their holy thing."
2 Samuel,20,26,"And Ira, a total boss from the Jairite fam, had major authority alongside David. {major authority...: or, a top-tier leader}"
2 Samuel,21,1,"So basically, there was this huge famine going on during David's time for three whole years, like every single year. And guess what? David was like, 'Yo, God, what's up with this famine?' And let me tell you, God had an answer ready. It turns out, it was all because of Saul and his brutal actions against the Gibeonites. So yeah, David sought God's guidance on this issue, and he got some serious insight."
2 Samuel,21,2,"So the king hits up the Gibeonites, and he's like, 'Yo, listen up! Just so you know, the Gibeonites aren't actually part of the Israelite crew. They're like leftovers from the Amorites. But, you know what? The Israelites made a promise to them, so we gotta respect that. Oh, and by the way, Saul, in his intense loyalty to the Israelites and Judah, tried to kill them."
2 Samuel,21,3,"So David was like, yo Gibeonites, what can I do to make it up to you? How can I make things right, so that you can bless God's inheritance?"
2 Samuel,21,4,"The Gibeonites were like, 'We ain't interested in Saul's money or his peeps. You don't gotta kill anyone from Israel for us.' And he was like, 'Whatever you guys want, I got you.'"
2 Samuel,21,5,"So they said to the king, this dude totally wrecked us and planned to wipe us out from all over Israel!"
2 Samuel,21,6,"Yo, give us seven of his sons and we'll hang them up for the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, cuz the LORD chose that spot, ya know? And the king was like, 'Yeah, I'll hand 'em over. They're the LORD's chosen ones.'"
2 Samuel,21,7,"But the king was like, 'Nah, Mephibosheth, you cool. You gotta chill, bro. I made a promise to the LORD to look out for you, 'cause you're Jonathan's son and all. It's all about that bond between David and Jonathan, straight up'."
2 Samuel,21,8,"Yo, the king took the two sons of Rizpah, who was Saul's daughter, named Armoni and Mephibosheth. He also took the five sons of Michal, Saul's other daughter, who was raised by Adriel, Barzillai the Meholathite's son. (BTW, Michal's sister also brought up these sons for Adriel.)"
2 Samuel,21,9,"And he gave them over to the Gibeonites, who hung them on the hill in front of the LORD. All seven of them fell together and were killed during harvest time, at the beginning of the barley harvest."
2 Samuel,21,10,"So Rizpah, Aiah's daughter, grabbed some sackcloth and laid it out on the rock. She stayed there from the start of harvest until rain fell from the sky, making sure no birds chilled on them during the day and no animals crashed there at night."
2 Samuel,21,11,"So, like, they told David what Rizpah, daughter of Aiah and Saul's side chick, did."
2 Samuel,21,12,"So David went and grabbed the bones of Saul and Jonathan from the people of Jabeshgilead, who had snatched them from the streets of Bethshan where the Philistines had left them hanging after they had killed Saul in Gilboa:"
2 Samuel,21,13,"So he took the bones of Saul and Jonathan, his son, and gathered the bones of those who were hanged from there."
2 Samuel,21,14,"So they laid to rest the remains of Saul and his son Jonathan in the land of Benjamin at Zelah, in the tomb of Kish, his father. They obeyed all of the king's instructions. And it was only then that God answered their prayers and brought blessing to the land."
2 Samuel,21,15,"So, like, the Philistines were, like, at it again, having another round of war with Israel, and David was like, 'Nah, I'm not just gonna sit back and chill,' so he rolled up with his squad and straight up battled those Philistines. And let me tell you, David was giving his all, but he started feeling pretty tired, man."
2 Samuel,21,16,"So there was this dude named Ishbibenob, who was from a whole line of giants. This guy had a serious heavy spear, like three hundred shekels of solid brass heavy. And get this, he was rocking a brand new sword too. He actually thought he could take down David, but nah, didn't happen. David ain't no easy target, you know?"
2 Samuel,21,17,"Abishai, Zeruiah's son, came through for him. He attacked the Philistine and took him down. After that, David's crew vowed to him, saying, 'You're done with battling with us, we won't let you dim the shine of Israel anymore.' (Note: In Hebrew, 'shine' means candle or lamp.)"
2 Samuel,21,18,"So, like, there was another fight with the Philistines at Gob after all that, and this dude named Sibbechai, who's from Hushath, totally killed Saph, who was one of those giant dudes. You know, the son of the giant. (Or maybe they called him Rapha, who knows?)"
2 Samuel,21,19,"So, there was another epic showdown in Gob between the Philistines and Elhanan, the son of Jaareoregim, who's from Bethlehem. And get this, Elhanan totally defeated Goliath the Gittite, who happened to be the brother of the one and only Goliath, the famous giant. Goliath's weapon was huge, like a super thick weaver's beam. Oh and just in case you're wondering, Jaareoregim is also known as Jair."
2 Samuel,21,20,"So there was this epic battle going down in Gath, and there was this insanely tall dude with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, making a total of twenty-four digits. And get this, he was even born from a giant family."
2 Samuel,21,21,"And when he disrespected Israel, Jonathan, the bro of David, totally took him out. {disrespected: or, dissed} {bro: also known as, homie}"
2 Samuel,21,22,"These four were born to the absolute unit in Gath, and got wrecked by David and his squad."
2 Samuel,22,1,"So, David straight up talked to God and dropped this sick song when the Lord came through and saved him from all his enemies, including Saul:"
2 Samuel,22,2,"He's like, God is my rock, my safe haven, and my savior."
2 Samuel,22,3,"The one above all else, my trusted rock. He's my protector and my source of salvation, my ultimate defense, and my safe haven. He rescues me from harm and violence."
2 Samuel,22,4,"I'm gonna hit up the LORD, who's totally worthy of mad praise, and that's how I'm gonna be saved from all my haters."
2 Samuel,22,5,"When death's waves surrounded me and a bunch of ungodly people gave me major anxiety; like, it was so scary, you know?"
2 Samuel,22,6,"I was totally surrounded by the worst kind of pain and suffering; I couldn't escape the clutches of death; (sorrows: or, cords)"
2 Samuel,22,7,"When I was freaking out, I hit up the LORD and straight up pleaded to my God. And you know what? He totally heard me, like straight from his headquarters, and my cry reached his ears and all."
2 Samuel,22,8,"Like, the ground totally shook and trembled, and even the foundations of heaven were all like, moving and shaking, 'cause God was, like, super mad."
2 Samuel,22,9,"Smoke started billowing from his nose and fire spewed from his mouth, devouring everything in its path. The coals were blazing as a result."
2 Samuel,22,10,"He flexed the skies and pulled a sick move; total darkness was like, 'Bruh, chill' below him."
2 Samuel,22,11,"And he hopped on a cherub and yeeted through the air, and everyone saw him going fast like on the wind!"
2 Samuel,22,12,"And like, he created these super cool dark pavilions all around him, filled with dark waters, plus those totally dense clouds in the sky. It was like a total binding of waters, you know? Like, so mysterious and awesome!"
2 Samuel,22,13,Before him were fiery coals shining brightly.
2 Samuel,22,14,"OMG, the LORD came in with some major thunder from above, and the Most High straight up dropped a sick line."
2 Samuel,22,15,"And he shot out some arrows, totally scattered them; lightning struck, and totally messed them up."
2 Samuel,22,16,"Yo, the ocean got all wild and crazy, the depths of the earth were exposed when the Lord got all fired up, like he was blowing a huge gust of air from his nose."
2 Samuel,22,17,"He slid into my DMs, grabbed my attention, and rescued me from drowning in a sea of problems; {many: or, great}"
2 Samuel,22,18,"He totally saved me from my major enemy, like, the one who totally hated me and was, like, super powerful and stuff. I mean, they were way too strong for me to handle on my own."
2 Samuel,22,19,They totally ruined my vibe when I was going through some major struggles: but the LORD had my back all the way.
2 Samuel,22,20,"He like totally took me to this awesome place: he saved me, 'coz he thought I was pretty rad."
2 Samuel,22,21,"God totally hooked me up, recognizing my righteousness and giving me mad props for keeping my hands clean."
2 Samuel,22,22,"I've stayed true to the vibes of the LORD, never straying into wickedness and keeping it real with my God."
2 Samuel,22,23,"I was totally down with all of his righteous rulings, and I never ditched his awesome laws."
2 Samuel,22,24,"I was, like, living righteously in front of him and minding my own business without doing anything wrong."
2 Samuel,22,25,"So like, God totally rewarded me based on how dope I've been in living righteously, you know? He saw me all clean and pure and honored me accordingly. #blessed #God'sGotMyBack"
2 Samuel,22,26,"When someone is kind to others, you'll show kindness to them too. And when someone is honest and righteous, you'll be honest and righteous to them."
2 Samuel,22,27,"When you're genuine, you'll attract genuine people, but when you're full of attitude, you'll only turn people off."
2 Samuel,22,28,"And like, you totally got the backs of the people who are struggling, but you're also keeping an eye out for those arrogant ones, so you can totally bring them down."
2 Samuel,22,29,"You're my ultimate source of light, LORD, and You'll illuminate all my darkest moments."
2 Samuel,22,30,"Because of you, I've totally crushed it! With my crew, I've jumped over obstacles like a boss. Like, my God is just that amazing! No challenge is too big for us. #Unstoppable"
2 Samuel,22,31,"God's got it all figured out; His words are totally legit. He's like a total shield for those who put their trust in Him. Like, He's been through some serious tests and passed with flying colors. No doubt about it."
2 Samuel,22,32,"Like, seriously, who even compares to the LORD? And I mean, who else can be as solid as our God?"
2 Samuel,22,33,"God is, like, totally my source of strength and power. He's, like, the one who makes my path super flawless and stuff. (By the way, 'maketh' means 'riddeth' or 'looseth' in Hebrew, just so you know.)"
2 Samuel,22,34,He makes my feet agile like deer's feet and sets me upon high places.
2 Samuel,22,35,"He's like my personal battle coach, training me to be a total beast in combat. I'm so powerful, I can snap a steel bow with my bare arms!"
2 Samuel,22,36,You've hooked me up with your salvation shield and your chill vibes have totally leveled me up. {leveled me up...: Heb. multiplied me}
2 Samuel,22,37,"You've totally expanded my territory and made sure I stayed steady. Like, no way I'm gonna slip and fall, no doubt."
2 Samuel,22,38,I went after my haters and totally wiped them out; I didn't stop until I completely took them down.
2 Samuel,22,39,"And I totally defeated them and took them down, leaving them unable to get back up. Yup, they've totally fallen under my feet."
2 Samuel,22,40,You've equipped me with the power to face my enemies head on. You've made those who dared to oppose me surrender to my greatness.
2 Samuel,22,41,"You totally handed over my enemies to me, so I could totally wipe out the haters."
2 Samuel,22,42,"They searched for help, but no one could rescue them. They reached out to the LORD, but He didn't respond."
2 Samuel,22,43,"I totally crushed them, like, so hard that they became dust, and I stepped on them like they were dirt in the street, and scattered them all around."
2 Samuel,22,44,"Yo, you totally saved me from dealing with all the drama from my peeps. Like, you made me the boss of all these foreign nations that I didn't even know would end up serving me. So rad, dude!"
2 Samuel,22,45,"Random people will totally respect me: once they catch wind of what I'm sayin', they'll be like, 'Yes, I'm on board!' {Random people: It's a fancy way of sayin' people who don't really know me} {submit...: or, act like they're all in, when really, they're not}"
2 Samuel,22,46,"Randoms be ghosting, straight up spooked hiding in their comfort zones."
2 Samuel,22,47,"OMG, the LORD is so lit! Shout out to my rock, he's totally blessed. And let's give props to God, the ultimate rock who saves me. #blessed"
2 Samuel,22,48,"God's got my back, taking down anyone who messes with me."
2 Samuel,22,49,And that's what saved me from my haters: you totally boosted me above all those who tried to bring me down: you totally saved me from the toxic person.
2 Samuel,22,50,"So I'm gonna show mad appreciation to you, LORD, in front of all these peeps, and I'm gonna sing your name like no other."
2 Samuel,22,51,"He's like the ultimate savior for his king, showing mad love to his chosen one, David, and his descendants for eternity. No cap."
2 Samuel,23,1,"So, like, these are David's final words. David, son of Jesse, was like, super legit. He was chosen by the God of Jacob and his rhymes were pure fire. Here's what he had to say:"
2 Samuel,23,2,"Yo, the Spirit of the LORD spoke through me, and his word was like, on point in my tongue."
2 Samuel,23,3,"The God of Israel was like, 'Yo, listen up! The Rock of Israel talked to me and said that whoever's in charge of people should totally be fair and treat everyone with respect for God. Like, ruling with justice and fear of God, you know? Oh, and check this out, 'Be thou ruler, etc'."
2 Samuel,23,4,"And he'll be like the lit morning, when the sun pops up, a sunny morning without clouds; like the fresh grass sprouting out of the ground after a refreshing rain."
2 Samuel,23,5,"My crib may not be blessed by the divine vibes, but God is still keeping it real with me. He's hooked me up with an everlasting contract that's totally on point, no cap. That's my ultimate salvation and what I'm all about, even if things don't always go according to plan."
2 Samuel,23,6,"But all those worthless people will be like annoying thorns, too difficult to handle or control."
2 Samuel,23,7,"But whoever comes close to them better be armed with iron and a spear, because they're gonna get totally roasted by fire right where they stand!"
2 Samuel,23,8,"These are the names of the super cool dudes that David hung out with: The Tachmonite who was totally the boss and sat in a high position among the captains; his real name was Adino the Eznite, and get this, he straight up took out 800 guys with his spear all at once. And just so you know, Tachmonite or Joshebbassebet, whichever name you prefer, was the leader of the three badasses. And those guys he defeated? Yeah, he totally annihilated them. Just saying."
2 Samuel,23,9,"And then there was Eleazar, Dodo's son from Ahohite squad, one of the top three warriors with David. They faced off against a bunch of Philistines who were ready to fight, while the rest of the Israelite soldiers had given up and left:"
2 Samuel,23,10,"He got up and totally wrecked the Philistines until his hand got tired and stuck to the sword. And God brought about a huge win that day. After that, the people only stuck around to grab the loot."
2 Samuel,23,11,"Next up was Shammah, son of Agee the Hararite. So the Philistines decided to show up in full force, taking over a piece of land that was loaded with lentils. And let me tell you, everyone started booking it as soon as they saw the Philistines coming. They weren't ready for that battle!"
2 Samuel,23,12,"But he flexed right in the center, totally defended the place, and straight up defeated all the Philistines. And you won't even believe it, but the LORD totally made it happen, like, major victory vibes all around."
2 Samuel,23,13,"So, three of the top thirty dudes decided to join David during harvest in this sick cave called Adullam. Meanwhile, the Philistines set up camp in the valley of Rephaim. No biggie."
2 Samuel,23,14,"So David was chilling in a fortress, while the Philistines were posted up in Bethlehem at that time."
2 Samuel,23,15,"David was like, bruh I really want a sip of that water from the well in Bethlehem, you know, the one by the gate!"
2 Samuel,23,16,"So, like, these three absolute legends went full beast mode and straight up breached the Philistines' defenses. They even managed to get their hands on some water from the well in Bethlehem, right by the entrance, and brought it to David. But David, being the humble dude he is, didn't drink it. Instead, he offered it as an offering to the LORD."
2 Samuel,23,17,"Bro, no way am I gonna do this, Lord! This drink is like the blood of those dudes who risked their lives for it! I'm not touching it. These three epic dudes did all this stuff."
2 Samuel,23,18,"Abishai, Joab's bro, Zeruiah's son, was the boss of the top three warriors. He straight up took his spear and wrecked three hundred dudes, earning major respect as one of the three. Killed 'em all. And everyone was like, whoa."
2 Samuel,23,19,"Yo, wasn't he, like, the most legit out of the three? So, he was their boss and all, but didn't quite make it to the top three."
2 Samuel,23,20,"And this dude named Benaiah, who came from the legendary town of Kabzeel, was a real badass. He had done some insane stuff, like taking down two Moabite dudes who were as fierce as lions. Oh, and get this, he even went down into a freaking pit during a snowstorm and killed a lion. Talk about epic!"
2 Samuel,23,21,"So this guy totally took out this Egyptian dude who looked pretty impressive. The Egyptian had this fancy spear in his hand, but the guy just rolls up with a staff, snatches the spear from the Egyptian, and straight up finishes him off with his own weapon. Like, he totally owned him! Oh, and by the way, that Egyptian dude, he was a total towering giant or something, if you're into the specifics."
2 Samuel,23,22,"Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, totally slayed it and became a real legend among the top three warriors."
2 Samuel,23,23,"He was well respected, but he didn't make it to the top three. David appointed him as leader of his crew."
2 Samuel,23,24,"Yo, Asahel, Joab's bro, was part of the squad of thirty; Elhanan, Dodo's son from Bethlehem,"
2 Samuel,23,25,"Shammah and Elika from Harod,"
2 Samuel,23,26,"Helez, the Paltite, and Ira, the son of Ikkesh from Tekoa,"
2 Samuel,23,27,"Abiezer from Anethoth, Mebunnai from Hushath"
2 Samuel,23,28,"Zalmon, the ultimate Ahohite, and Maharai, the legendary Netophathite,"
2 Samuel,23,29,"Heleb, the son of Baanah, a cool Netophathite, Ittai, the son of Ribai from Gibeah of the Benjamin squad,"
2 Samuel,23,30,"Yo, Benaiah from Pirathon, Hiddai of the sick Gaash vibes, you feel me?"
2 Samuel,23,31,"Abialbon, the cool Arbathite, and Azmaveth, the Barhumite squad member,"
2 Samuel,23,32,"Eliahba from the fam of Shaalbon, repping the Jashen squad, Jonathan be his homie,"
2 Samuel,23,33,"Shammah da Hararite, Ahiam, Sharar da Hararite's kid,"
2 Samuel,23,34,"Eliphelet, who was the son of Ahasbai, who was the son of the Maachathite. Also, Eliam, son of Ahithophel, who hailed from Gilon."
2 Samuel,23,35,"Hezrai from Carmel, Paarai from the Arbites,"
2 Samuel,23,36,"Igal, Nathan's kid from Zobah, and Bani, the cool Gadite,"
2 Samuel,23,37,"Zelek, the Ammonite 🛡️, Naharai from Beeroth, the rad sidekick of Joab, Zeruiah's son,"
2 Samuel,23,38,"Ira, the cool Ithrite, and Gareb, another awesome Ithrite,"
2 Samuel,23,39,"Uriah, the Hittite, had a total of thirty-seven."
2 Samuel,24,1,"So, like, God got super mad at Israel again, and he made David feel a strong urge to be like, 'Hey, go count all the peeps in Israel and Judah.'"
2 Samuel,24,2,"So the king told Joab, the leader of his army, who was by his side, 'Yo, go and check out all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, and count all the people. I wanna know the total headcount, ya know?'"
2 Samuel,24,3,"And Joab was like, yo king, may the LORD your God increase the people like a hundred times, no matter how many there are, so that my lord the king can witness it. But, like, why is the king so into this?"
2 Samuel,24,4,"But the king totally overruled Joab and the crew, so they bounced. They dipped out from the king's presence and decided to do a headcount of the peeps in Israel."
2 Samuel,24,5,"So they crossed the Jordan River and set up camp in Aroer, on the cool side of the city that's right in the middle of the Gad River, towards Jazer."
2 Samuel,24,6,"After that, they traveled to Gilead and the land of Tahtimhodshi. They also made their way to Danjaan and almost reached Zidon, which is known as the newly inhabited nether land."
2 Samuel,24,7,Then they reached the fortress of Tyre and visited all the cities inhabited by the Hivites and Canaanites. They traveled south to Beersheba in Judah.
2 Samuel,24,8,"So, like, after totally exploring the whole land, they finally arrived in Jerusalem after, like, nine months and twenty days."
2 Samuel,24,9,"So Joab went and told the king how many warriors there were in Israel: 800k badass sword-wielding dudes, and in Judah, there were 500k dudes."
2 Samuel,24,10,"And David's heart felt guilty when he decided to count the people. David said to the LORD, 'I messed up big time with what I did. Now, I beg you, O LORD, please forgive your servant; I acted really foolishly.'"
2 Samuel,24,11,"So like, when David woke up in the morning, he got this message from the LORD through the prophet Gad, who was like David's personal seer, and the message was like,"
2 Samuel,24,12,"Yo, go tell David this message from the LORD: I got three options for you, pick one and I'll make it happen for ya."
2 Samuel,24,13,"So Gad pulled up on David and was like, 'Yo, listen up! You got three options, my dude. Option one: you down to deal with a seven-year famine in your land? Option two: you tryna dip for three months while your enemies chase after you? Option three: you cool with three days of straight-up plague in your land? Now, give me some advice and let me know what I should tell the one who sent me.'"
2 Samuel,24,14,"And David was like, dude, I'm in a major pickle right now. So, let's just go ahead and trust in the Lord's total awesomeness and goodness, 'cause He's got mad love and mercy. And please, I beg you, don't let me end up at the mercy of any human. Like, not cool, man."
2 Samuel,24,15,"So God totally unleashed a massive plague on Israel, like OMG from morning until the end of the day. And, can you believe it? Seventy thousand dudes died, like, from Dan all the way to Beersheba. It was, like, a serious catastrophe."
2 Samuel,24,16,"And like, when the angel dude reached out his hand to wreck Jerusalem, the LORD was like, 'Nah, my bad, let's not do this,' and told the angel bro who was causing all the destruction, 'Stop right there, that's enough.' So the angel of the LORD was chilling near the threshing area of Araunah the Jebusite. (P.S. Araunah is also known as Ornan, just FYI)"
2 Samuel,24,17,"So David was like, 'Yo, God, I gotta talk to you real quick. I saw this angel straight up punishing the people and I gotta admit, I messed up big time. I did some seriously messed up stuff. But like, these innocent sheep, man, they didn't do anything wrong. So could you, like, put your wrath on me and my whole family instead? I'm just tryna take responsibility here.'"
2 Samuel,24,18,"So, like, Gad rolled up to David one day and was like, 'Bro, you gotta go and set up a sick altar for the LORD on Araunah the Jebusite's threshing floor. It's gonna be lit, trust me!'"
2 Samuel,24,19,"So David, like Gad said, went up as the LORD commanded."
2 Samuel,24,20,"Araunah peeped and spotted the king and his crew heading his way. So Araunah stepped out, totally respectful, and bowed down to the king, face planted on the ground."
2 Samuel,24,21,"Araunah's like, yo what's up, why you here king? And David's straight up like, I'm here to cop your threshingfloor and build an altar for the LORD to stop the plague from messing with the people."
2 Samuel,24,22,"So Araunah was like, 'Yo David, go ahead and do whatever you think is cool, king! Check it out, I got some dope oxen for burnin' sacrifices, and there are also some sick threshing tools and stuff from the oxen that you can use for firewood.'"
2 Samuel,24,23,"Araunah, the king, gave all these things to the king. And Araunah said to the king, 'May the LORD your God bless you.'"
2 Samuel,24,24,"And the king was like, no way, but I'll totally purchase it from you, bro, for a fair price. I ain't about to offer some cheap sacrifice to the LORD my God, it's gotta cost me something, ya know? So David bought the sick spot and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver."
2 Samuel,24,25,"Then David was like, 'Yo, I'ma build an altar for the Lord right here!' And he made hella burnt offerings and peace offerings. And you know what? The Lord totally listened and stopped the plague from messing with Israel."
1 Kings,1,1,"So, like, King David was like super old and just really frail, you know? They tried to keep him warm by covering him with clothes, but dude was just cold all the time. Like, his body couldn't generate any heat or something. It's like he was really advanced in years and stuff."
1 Kings,1,2,"So his homies said to him, yo, we gotta find a fresh young babe for my boy the king. She gonna stand by his side, show him love and be his bae. Like, they gonna get cozy together so my boy the king can feel the fire."
1 Kings,1,3,"So they were searching for a hot girl all over Israel, and stumbled upon Abishag, a total babe from Shunem, and brought her to the king."
1 Kings,1,4,"And the girl was super attractive, and she was really into the king, and took care of him and served him. But the king didn't hook up with her."
1 Kings,1,5,"So Adonijah, Haggith's son, thought he could totally be the king. He flexed by getting himself some sick chariots, horsemen, and even fifty dudes to hype him up. #RoyalGoals #Reign"
1 Kings,1,6,"And his dad never got mad at him and asked, 'Why'd you do that?' He was a really good-looking guy too, and his mom had him after Absalom."
1 Kings,1,7,"And he talked with Joab, son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest. They teamed up with Adonijah and supported him."
1 Kings,1,8,"But Zadok the priest, Benaiah (Jehoiada's son), Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David's awesome squad were not rollin' with Adonijah."
1 Kings,1,9,"And Adonijah killed some dope sheep and oxen and thicc cattle near this lit spot called Zoheleth, right next to Enrogel. He gathered all his bros, who were the king's sons, and all the homies from Judah who worked for the king. Enrogel was like a sick well, by the way, also known as the well Rogel."
1 Kings,1,10,"But Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the epic warriors, and Solomon, his bro, he didn't even reach out to them."
1 Kings,1,11,"So, like, Nathan goes up to Bathsheba, Solomon's mom, and he's like, 'Yo, have you not heard that Adonijah, Haggith's son, is lowkey ruling, and our main man David has no clue?'"
1 Kings,1,12,"So, like, listen up now. I'm about to drop some wisdom on you. It's important if you wanna save your own life and your son Solomon's life too, you know what I'm saying?"
1 Kings,1,13,"Yo, go find King David and be like, 'Bro, didn't you swear to me, your loyal servant, that Solomon, your son, would be the next king? So why is Adonijah ruling instead?'"
1 Kings,1,14,"Yo, listen up. While you're still chatting it up with the king, I'm gonna slide in right after you and back you up, making your words even stronger. {confirm: Heb. fill up}"
1 Kings,1,15,"So Bathsheba entered the king's chamber, and, like, the king was like super old, you know? And this girl named Abishag from Shunem was, like, taking care of the king and stuff."
1 Kings,1,16,"Bathsheba was respectful and bowed down to the king. And the king asked, 'What's up? What can I do for you?'"
1 Kings,1,17,"And she was like, 'Dude, you made a promise to me, swearin' by the LORD your God, that Solomon, your son, would totally become king after me and take over my throne.'"
1 Kings,1,18,"Yo, listen up, Adonijah is totally in charge now. And, like, King, you have no clue about it, okay?"
1 Kings,1,19,"So, he's like totally slaughtered a ton of oxen, fat cattle, and sheep, and he's gathered all the king's sons, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the leader of the army. But he hasn't invited your buddy Solomon, man."
1 Kings,1,20,"Yo, King, all of Israel is watching you! They wanna know who's gonna take the throne after you, my dude."
1 Kings,1,21,"If my king, like, dies and stuff, me and my boy Solomon will be labeled as troublemakers. (troublemakers: Hebrew for sinners)"
1 Kings,1,22,"And OMG, as she was still talking with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in."
1 Kings,1,23,"So, they were like, 'Yo, the king, Nathan the prophet is here!' And when Nathan came in, he straight up bowed down and put his face on the ground, showing mad respect for the king."
1 Kings,1,24,"And Nathan was like, yo king, did you say Adonijah's gonna rule after me and take my throne?"
1 Kings,1,25,"Yo, this dude went all out today! He's straight up slayed a ton of oxen, fat cattle, and sheep. Plus, he's gathered all the king's sons, the captains of the crew, and Abiathar the priest. They're feasting it up and shouting, 'Long live King Adonijah!'"
1 Kings,1,26,"But like, yo, even I, your homie, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and your boy Solomon, haven't been summoned or anything."
1 Kings,1,27,Did my dude the king do this without telling your homie who's supposed to be the next king after him?
1 Kings,1,28,"So King David was like, 'Yo, bring Bathsheba here.' And she rolled up to the king's crib, standing in front of him and all."
1 Kings,1,29,"And the king was like, dude, I swear on everything that's epic and amazing, the LORD is legit and has totally saved me from all the messed up situations!"
1 Kings,1,30,"Like, I promised you before the LORD God of Israel, for real, that Solomon your son is totally gonna be the next king after me. He'll like, literally sit on my throne and everything. And guess what? Today, I'm absolutely gonna make it happen, no doubt."
1 Kings,1,31,"Bathsheba straight up bowed down to the ground, showing respect to the king, and said, 'Long live my lord, King David, forever.'"
1 Kings,1,32,"So, like King David was all, 'Yo, get Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the homie, son of Jehoiada. And they came and stood in front of the king, ya know?"
1 Kings,1,33,"Yo, listen up! The king told them, 'Grab your lord's servants, and let Solomon, my son, ride on my sick mule. Take him down to Gihon ASAP. It's mine, ya feel me?'"
1 Kings,1,34,"So, Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet should totally declare him king of Israel, and you guys should blast the trumpet and shout, Godd save King Solomon!'"
1 Kings,1,35,"So, like, once he's done, you should totally come up and take his spot on the throne. 'Cause, like, you're gonna be the new king in my place, and I've totally picked you to be the ruler over Israel and Judah."
1 Kings,1,36,"And Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, responded to the king, and he was like, 'For real, dude! The LORD God of my lord, the king, totally agrees, yo.'"
1 Kings,1,37,"Just like the LORD has been with my lord the king, let him also be with Solomon, and make his throne even more epic than my lord king David's throne."
1 Kings,1,38,"Then Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah (Jehoiada's son), the Cherethites, and the Pelethites all went down and made Solomon ride on King David's mule, and led him to Gihon."
1 Kings,1,39,"So, like, this priest dude named Zadok grabbed a bottle of oil from the fancy tent and poured it all over Solomon. Then, they started hella blowing the trumpet and all the people were like, 'Yo, God bless king Solomon!'"
1 Kings,1,40,"And everyone followed him, jamming out on their instruments, and celebrated like there was no tomorrow! The noise they made was so hype that it shook the ground."
1 Kings,1,41,"Adonijah and all his squad heard it while they were finished grubbing. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he was like, yo, why is the whole city tripping?"
1 Kings,1,42,"And as he was still talking, bro, Jonathan, Abiathar's son and the priest, pulled up. Adonijah was like, 'Yo, come on in! You're a total legend and you bring awesome news!'"
1 Kings,1,43,"And Jonathan was like, dude, Adonijah, for real, our king David made Solomon the boss king."
1 Kings,1,44,"So the king sent Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites to accompany him, and they made him ride on the king's mule."
1 Kings,1,45,"So like, Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet just made him king in Gihon, and they're all hyped as they come back to the city, so it's like a crazy celebration going on. That's the sound that y'all are hearing."
1 Kings,1,46,"And yo, Solomon is chillaxin' on the throne, ruling the kingdom."
1 Kings,1,47,"And the king's squad came to give props to our boy King David, saying, May the man Solomon flex a better rep than you, and may his throne be bigger than your throne. And the king showed mad respect by bowing on his bed."
1 Kings,1,48,"And like, the king was like, 'Yo, praise the LORD God of Israel, man! He's hooked me up with someone to rule on my throne today, and bro, I totally saw it with my own eyes! 🙌👑"
1 Kings,1,49,"And all of Adonijah's crew got shook, bounced and scattered."
1 Kings,1,50,"Adonijah got scared of Solomon, so he hopped up, went out, and grabbed onto the altar's horns."
1 Kings,1,51,"So, Solomon got a message that basically said, 'Yo, check it out, Adonijah is scared of you, bro. He's freaking clutching onto the altar like his life depends on it, begging you to pinky swear that you won't go all sword-wielding crazy and kill him today.'"
1 Kings,1,52,"Solomon was like, if this dude proves he's legit, not a single strand of his hair will be harmed. But if he turns out to be wicked, he's donezo."
1 Kings,1,53,"So King Solomon was like, 'Yo, go get him from the altar.' And they brought him down and he came over, showed mad respect by bowing to King Solomon. Then Solomon was like, 'Bro, time for you to head back home.'"
1 Kings,2,1,"So like, the time was getting close for David to pass away, and he gave Solomon, his son, some super important instructions, you know what I'm saying?"
1 Kings,2,2,"I'm about to kick the bucket like everyone else: so, like, man up and show some real strength!"
1 Kings,2,3,"Make sure you obey the rules of the LORD your God and follow his ways, keeping all his laws, commandments, judgments, and testimonies that are written in the law of Moses. By doing this, you'll succeed in everything you do and wherever you go. {succeed: or, be wise}"
1 Kings,2,4,"So basically, God's like, 'Yo, I'm gonna make sure my promise to you stays legit, bro. If your fam stays on point, walking in truth with their whole being, I promise you won't be lacking a king ruling over Israel. Like, seriously, no one's gonna snatch that away from you.'"
1 Kings,2,5,"Also, you're aware of all the messed up stuff Joab did to me, right? He straight up killed Abner and Amasa, who were high-ranking dudes in Israel's army! And get this, he spilled their blood even when there wasn't a dang war going on. He was so ruthless, he stained his belt and shoes with their blood like some sick trophy."
1 Kings,2,6,"So, like, use your smarts and make sure his gray hair doesn't rest in peace when he kicks the bucket."
1 Kings,2,7,"Yo, be cool to the dudes from Barzillai's fam, the Gileadites, and let 'em chill at your table, 'cause they had my back when I bounced 'cause of your brother Absalom."
1 Kings,2,8,"Yo, check it out, you still got Shimei, Gera's son, a Benjamite from Bahurim, who seriously cursed me over at Mahanaim. But when I got to the Jordan, he came to meet me, and I made a promise to him in the name of the LORD, saying, I won't kill you with a sword, bro. Word."
1 Kings,2,9,"So like, don't just let him slide, dude. You're totally wise and know exactly what you should do to him. But make sure he pays for his wrongs, even if it means taking him down to the grave with just retribution."
1 Kings,2,10,"After living a full life, David passed away and was laid to rest in the city of David."
1 Kings,2,11,"So, David was in charge of Israel for a whole 40 years. He started his reign in Hebron and ruled there for 7 years. Then, he moved to Jerusalem and ruled for another 33 years."
1 Kings,2,12,"So Solomon slid into David's throne, a total power move, and his kingdom was totally lit, like, it was on another level."
1 Kings,2,13,"So Adonijah, Haggith's son, went to meet Solomon's mom, Bathsheba. And she was like, 'Are you here to cause any trouble?' And he was like, 'Nah, just chillin'."
1 Kings,2,14,"He was like, 'Yo, I got something to tell you.' And she was like, 'Spill the tea!'"
1 Kings,2,15,"And he was like, you know that the kingdom used to be mine, and, like, all of Israel was supporting me to be the ruler. But, like, things have totally flipped, and now the kingdom belongs to my bro because the Big Guy upstairs said so."
1 Kings,2,16,"So like, I've got this one favor to ask. Please don't say no. And she's all like, 'Yeah, sure, spill it.'"
1 Kings,2,17,"So, like, he was all, 'Dude, please talk to King Solomon and ask him for me, because he totally won't refuse, to let me marry Abishag the Shunammite.'"
1 Kings,2,18,"And Bathsheba was like, okay, I gotchu fam, I'll go talk to the king for you."
1 Kings,2,19,"So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to talk to him about Adonijah. When the king saw her, he got up, greeted her, and took a seat on his throne. He even arranged for a chair to be set up for his mom, who sat on his right side."
1 Kings,2,20,"So she's like, I've got this small request, pretty pretty please don't deny me. And the king's like, Sure, go ahead, mom! I won't say no to you."
1 Kings,2,21,"And she was like, yo, give Abishag the Shunammite to Adonijah, your bro, as his wife, you know?"
1 Kings,2,22,"Yo, listen up, Queen Mother! Why are you going to Abishag the Shunammite to ask for Adonijah? If you want, just go ahead and ask for the whole kingdom! 'Cause guess what? He's my older bro, so he's got a claim too, along with Abiathar the priest and Joab, son of Zeruiah."
1 Kings,2,23,"And like, King Solomon literally swears by the LORD, and he's all like, Godd better do all sorts of crazy stuff to me, like seriously intense stuff, if Adonijah didn't say this thing that's gonna totally mess up his life.'"
1 Kings,2,24,"So, like, I swear to God, the Almighty One who made me king and put me on the throne that belonged to my dad David, and who fulfilled the promise of giving me a palace; today, Adonijah will totally face death."
1 Kings,2,25,"So King Solomon sent Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, to take care of business, and let's just say things didn't end well for the guy."
1 Kings,2,26,"The king told Abiathar the priest, 'Go to Anathoth and tend to your own land. You deserve to die, but I won't kill you now because you served in front of God's ark for my father David and went through all the hardships he endured.'"
1 Kings,2,27,"So Solomon kicked Abiathar out from being a priest for the LORD, to make sure that what the LORD said about Eli's family in Shiloh would happen."
1 Kings,2,28,"So Joab heard the news because he was hanging out with Adonijah, not with Absalom. Joab got scared and ran to the LORD's hangout spot, grabbing onto the altar for dear life."
1 Kings,2,29,"So, like, word got to King Solomon that Joab escaped to the sacred place of the LORD, and guess what, he's chillin' right by the altar. So, Solomon's like, 'Yo, Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, go get him!'"
1 Kings,2,30,"So Benaiah went to the place where God was chilling, and he was like, 'Yo, the King wants you to come out.' But the guy was like, 'Nah, I'm staying here and I'm ready to die.' Then Benaiah went back to the King and was like, 'This is what Joab said, and this is how he responded to me.'"
1 Kings,2,31,"Then the king was like, 'Yeah, do what he said and tackle him, bury him and all. We gotta make sure to clear Joab's name from spilling innocent blood on me and my fam.'"
1 Kings,2,32,"And God will make him pay for what he did by making him suffer. He attacked two guys who were way cooler and righteous than him, and straight up murdered them. My dad David had no idea about any of this, just to be clear. The dudes he killed were Abner, the boss of Israel's army, and Amasa, the boss of Judah's army."
1 Kings,2,33,"So Joab and his descendants will bear the responsibility for their actions, paying for it with their own blood. But as for David, his descendants, his household, and his throne, they will enjoy everlasting peace bestowed by the LORD."
1 Kings,2,34,"Then Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, went up and took him out, killing him. They buried him in his own crib out in the middle of nowhere."
1 Kings,2,35,"The king chose Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, to take charge of his army, and Zadok the priest replaced Abiathar."
1 Kings,2,36,"So the king reached out to Shimei and was like, 'Yo bro, go ahead and build yourself a sick pad in Jerusalem. Settle down there and don't even think about bouncing out.'"
1 Kings,2,37,"Listen up, when you leave and cross over the Kidron brook, you better believe you're heading straight for doom. Your own blood will be on your hands, no doubt about it."
1 Kings,2,38,"Shimei was like, 'Yo, the king's words are straight fire. Whatever my lord the king commanded, your boy Shimei got you. And Shimei chilled in Jerusalem for a hot minute."
1 Kings,2,39,"So, after three years, two of Shimei's servants decided to dip and bounced to Achish, son of Maachah, the king of Gath. They hit up Shimei like, 'Yo, bro, guess where your servants are? Gath, man!'"
1 Kings,2,40,"So Shimei got up and hopped on his ride, headed to Gath to find his crew. Shimei went, and managed to bring his squad back from Gath."
1 Kings,2,41,"So, like, word got to Solomon that Shimei, you know, had dipped from Jerusalem to Gath and then pulled a U-turn."
1 Kings,2,42,"So the king texts Shimei and says, 'Bro, remember when I made you swear by the LORD and warned you that if you ever leave or go anywhere, you'll definitely die? And you were like, 'Yeah man, I got it, the word I heard sounds good'."
1 Kings,2,43,"So like, why didn't you keep your promise to the LORD and do what I told you to?"
1 Kings,2,44,"The king straight up told Shimei, like, you know all the messed up stuff you did to my dad David, right? Well, let me break it down for you: God's gonna totally make you pay for all your wickedness, like, it's gonna come back and bite you in the end, man."
1 Kings,2,45,"King Solomon gonna be blessed, and David's throne gonna stay strong in front of the LORD forever."
1 Kings,2,46,"Then the king told Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, to go and take care of him. Benaiah did as he was told and ended up finishing the guy off, so he kicked the bucket. And that's how Solomon became the boss of the kingdom."
1 Kings,3,1,"So Solomon hit it off with Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and started dating Pharaoh's daughter. He brought her back to the city of David while he finished building his own crib, the temple for the LORD, and the walls of Jerusalem all around."
1 Kings,3,2,"Back in the day, peeps used to do their sacrifices on the high places since there wasn't a legit house built in the name of the LORD at that time."
1 Kings,3,3,"Solomon was totally devoted to the LORD and followed in the footsteps of his father David, but he sometimes went all out with sacrifices and incense at the cool hangout spots."
1 Kings,3,4,"So the king headed to Gibeon to make sacrifices there, because it was a major holy spot. Solomon went all out and made a whopping thousand burnt offerings on that altar."
1 Kings,3,5,"So, like, one night, God made this total appearance to Solomon in a dream in Gibeon, right? And God was all like, 'Yo, ask me whatever you want and I'll hook you up, bro!'"
1 Kings,3,6,"And Solomon was like, yo, you totally showed my dad, David, mad love by giving him all that mercy and being real with him. He stayed true to you, always walking in truth, righteousness, and keeping it real with you. And you even blessed him with a son to take over his throne, which is still happening right now. It's all about that kindness, man."
1 Kings,3,7,"And now, yo God, you've made me king instead of my pops David. And to be real, I'm just a lil' kid. I don't even know how to step out or come in."
1 Kings,3,8,"And your servant is, like, totally chillin' with your chosen peeps, who are, like, a massive squad that, legit, can't even be counted or put a number on."
1 Kings,3,9,"So, like, God, can you just bless me with some serious wisdom? I need to be able to tell right from wrong when I'm dealing with your awesome squad. I mean, who has the skills to handle such a rad group of people, am I right?"
1 Kings,3,10,"And God was totally stoked with what Solomon asked, it made Him happy AF."
1 Kings,3,11,"And God said to him, yo, because you asked for this and didn't ask for like a super long life or riches or anything like that, and you didn't even ask for the harm of your enemies, but you asked for understanding to make good judgments, like that's legit cool of you, man."
1 Kings,3,12,"Listen up, I've totally delivered what you asked for - check it out, I've hooked you up with a brain that's wise and full of understanding. No one in the past or future will even come close to matching your greatness."
1 Kings,3,13,"I've totally hooked you up with things you didn't even ask for, like mad stacks of cash and mad respect, yo. Ain't nobody gonna be as gnarly as you, ruling the kings game forever. {shall...: or, hath not been}"
1 Kings,3,14,"And, like, if you're down to follow my vibes, keeping it real with my rules and stuff, just like your homie David did, then I'll hook you up with a nice long life, no cap."
1 Kings,3,15,"So Solomon woke up and realized it was all just a dream. Then he went to Jerusalem and stood in front of the ark of the LORD's covenant. He offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and threw a big feast for all his homies."
1 Kings,3,16,"So, like, these two women, who everyone knew were, like, sex workers or whatever, they came to the king and, like, stood right in front of him."
1 Kings,3,17,"So, like, this one woman was like, 'Yo, dude, me and this chick live together and we both had babies in the same house.'"
1 Kings,3,18,"So, like, three days after I had given birth, this other lady also gave birth. And we were there together, like, just the two of us in the house. There was nobody else around, you know."
1 Kings,3,19,"And like, this lady's baby passed away during the night 'cause she accidentally laid on top of it or something."
1 Kings,3,20,"So, like, in the middle of the night, she got up and snatched my kid from next to me, while I was knocked out, and put him in her arms, then put her lifeless baby in my arms."
1 Kings,3,21,"So, when I woke up in the morning to feed my baby, I was shocked to find out that the little one had passed away. But as I took a closer look in the morning, I realized that the baby lying there was not my own, the one I gave birth to."
1 Kings,3,22,"Then one of them spoke up and said, 'No, the baby who is alive is my child, and the baby who is dead is yours.' But the other one argued, 'No way, the dead baby is yours and the alive baby is mine.' They kept on arguing like this in front of the king."
1 Kings,3,23,"Then the king was like, one person is claiming 'This is my living child and yours is the deceased one', and the other person is saying, 'No way! Your child is the dead one and mine is the one who's alive'."
1 Kings,3,24,"Then the king's like, yo, get me a sword. So they brought a sword to the king and all."
1 Kings,3,25,"So the king was like, 'Yo, let's cut the baby in half and give each of them a piece.'"
1 Kings,3,26,"So this woman, who was the real mother of the child, spoke up to the king. She had such a strong love for her son that it felt like her heart was burning inside. She pleaded, 'Oh my lord, please give her the child and don't let anyone harm him.' But the other woman insisted, 'Let's just cut the child in half and share him.'"
1 Kings,3,27,"So, like, the king was all like, 'Yo, just give her the baby, don't even think about killing it. She's totally the real mom, man.'"
1 Kings,3,28,"When everyone in Israel found out about the king's fair judgment, they were in awe of him because they could see that God had blessed him with wisdom and good judgment."
1 Kings,4,1,"So, like, King Solomon was, like, the ruler of all Israel, you know."
1 Kings,4,2,"And these were the top dudes he had; Azariah, the son of Zadok the priest, you know, the big boss of the priests."
1 Kings,4,3,"Elihoreph and Ahiah, Shisha's kids who were really good at writing stuff down; Jehoshaphat, Ahilud's son, the expert at keeping records. {scribes: or, secretaries} {recorder: or, remembrancer}"
1 Kings,4,4,"Benaiah, Jehoiada's kid, was in charge of the squad, while Zadok and Abiathar held it down as the priests."
1 Kings,4,5,"Azariah, Nathan's son, was in charge of the officers, while Zabud, another one of Nathan's sons, held the important position of the king's right-hand man and close friend."
1 Kings,4,6,"Ahishar was in charge of running the household, and Adoniram, Abda's son, was responsible for collecting taxes."
1 Kings,4,7,"So, like Solomon had these twelve squad leaders running the show in Israel. They were in charge of making sure the king and his fam were all well-fed and taken care of. Each officer would take turns, one month at a time, to handle all the food and supplies."
1 Kings,4,8,"And these are their names: The son of Hur, in chill mount Ephraim: Benhur"
1 Kings,4,9,"The dude named Dekar's offspring be ruling over Makaz, Shaalbim, Bethshemesh, and Elonbethhanan. Bendekar might be involved too. Like, he might be Dekar's son or something."
1 Kings,4,10,Hesed's son was in charge of Aruboth. He had control over Sochoh and all the land of Hepher.
1 Kings,4,11,"Abinadab's son was in charge of the whole Dor area. He was married to Taphath, Solomon's daughter. (By the way, Abinadab means Benabinadab)"
1 Kings,4,12,"Baana, the son of Ahilud, had control over Taanach, Megiddo, and all of Bethshean, which is located near Zartanah below Jezreel, from Bethshean to Abelmeholah, all the way to the area beyond Jokneam."
1 Kings,4,13,"Geber's son was in charge of Ramothgilead. He owned the towns of Jair, Manasseh's son, in Gilead. He also had control over the region of Argob in Bashan. That place had a whopping sixty big cities with walls and metal bars. The son of Geber was a total boss at managing it all!"
1 Kings,4,14,"Iddo's son, Ahinadab, he was all about Mahanaim, you know - like, he was really into that place, Mahanaim. It was his jam, you know what I'm saying? Mahanaim all the way!"
1 Kings,4,15,"Ahimaaz was from Naphtali; he totally married Basmath, Solomon's daughter. #RelationshipGoals"
1 Kings,4,16,"Baanah, Hushai's kid, held it down in Asher and Aloth:"
1 Kings,4,17,"Jehoshaphat, Paruah's kid, repping Issachar:"
1 Kings,4,18,"Shimei, Elah's kid, reppin' Benjamin:"
1 Kings,4,19,"Geber, Uri's son, was in the land of Gilead, under the rule of Sihon, the Amorite king, and Og, the king of Bashan. He was the sole top dog in the whole land."
1 Kings,4,20,"Judah and Israel had a massive squad, like the insane amount of sand by the sea. They were all about feasting, partying, and having a blast."
1 Kings,4,21,"Solomon was the ruler of all the kingdoms, from the river to the land of the Philistines and all the way to the border of Egypt. People gave him gifts and served him faithfully throughout his entire life."
1 Kings,4,22,"So, like, Solomon's daily food stash was, like, 30 loads of dope fine flour and 60 loads of meal, you know? #FeastGoals #BreadLife"
1 Kings,4,23,"I got ten thicc oxen, twenty oxen chillin' in the meadows, a whole hundred sheep, and not to mention some harts, roebucks, fallowdeer, and some top-tier fatted fowl."
1 Kings,4,24,"Yo, this dude had complete control over all the land from Tiphsah to Azzah, ruling over all the kings in that area. And get this, he had mad peace going on, like, no drama anywhere around him."
1 Kings,4,25,"So, like, Judah and Israel were just chillin', you know? Living their best lives without any worries. Each dude had his own spot, kicking back under his vine and fig tree. It was all good vibes from Dan to Beersheba, throughout Solomon's reign. They were straight up living confidently, you feel me?"
1 Kings,4,26,"So basically, Solomon was flexin' with like, forty thousand horse parking spots for his flashy chariots, and he had twelve thousand soldiers riding those horses. Talk about a serious horse game, dude."
1 Kings,4,27,"And those high-ranking peeps kept the food game strong for King Solomon and all his homies at the royal feast, making sure everyone was well-fed every month. No one went hungry, fam."
1 Kings,4,28,They also brought barley and straw for the horses and dromedaries to the designated spot where the officers were stationed. Each person contributed according to their responsibilities. (Dromedaries can be understood as mules or swift beasts.)
1 Kings,4,29,"God blessed Solomon with mad wisdom and understanding, like, literally so much, and his heart was, like, huge, bro, just like the sand on the beach."
1 Kings,4,30,"Solomon was, like, the smartest out of everyone from the east and even those brainiacs from Egypt."
1 Kings,4,31,"He was the ultimate wisdom flex, smarter than everyone: even Ethan, Heman, Chalcol, and Darda, the coolest guys out there. He was famous in all the nations around. Respect."
1 Kings,4,32,"So basically, this dude dropped three thousand proverbs like they were hot and blessed us with a thousand and five sick tunes."
1 Kings,4,33,"And he talked about trees, from the giant cedar trees in Lebanon all the way to the hyssop that grows out of the wall. He also talked about animals, birds, creepy crawlies, and fish."
1 Kings,4,34,"So like, people from all over the place were flocked to hear Solomon's wisdom, even kings who had heard how insanely wise he was."
1 Kings,5,1,"So Hiram, the king of Tyre, sent his peeps to Solomon because he heard that they crowned him as king, taking over from his dad. Hiram was always a big fan of David, ya know? (P.S. Hiram is also known as Huram.)"
1 Kings,5,2,"So Solomon DM'd Hiram, like,"
1 Kings,5,3,"Yo, you know how David, my pops, couldn't even build a crib for the Lord his God 'cause he was caught up in wars from all directions? But, the Lord helped him subdue his enemies, making them bow down under his feet."
1 Kings,5,4,"But yo, God be hooking me up with mad chill vibes, makin' it all cool on all fronts, like no haters or drama disruptin' the flow."
1 Kings,5,5,"Yo, check it out, I'm planning on building a sick crib for the Lord my God, just like He told my pops David. He said that my son, who's gonna take over my throne, is gonna be the one to build a house in His name. No cap, that's what He said."
1 Kings,5,6,"So like, can you make sure that they cut down cedar trees from Lebanon? And then my crew will work with yours, ya know? I'll totally pay you for your peeps based on whatever you say, cause you're aware that none of us are skilled at cutting timber like the peeps from Sidon."
1 Kings,5,7,"So, like, Hiram was stoked when he heard what Solomon said, and he was all like, 'Dude, the LORD totally blessed David today by giving him a super smart son to rule over this awesome nation!'"
1 Kings,5,8,"Yo, Solomon, just got your message from Hiram. I've totally checked out the stuff you need and I'm down to hook you up with all the cedar and fir timber you want. No worries, consider it done!"
1 Kings,5,9,"My crew will bring those goods from Lebanon to the coast. Then we'll ship them on cool floating vessels to the spot you choose. Once we reach the destination, we'll unload them and you'll receive everything. This way, I'll be able to fulfill my goal of providing food for my fam. (Note: 'appoint' means 'send' in Hebrew)"
1 Kings,5,10,"So Hiram hooked Solomon up with some mad cedar trees and fir trees, just like he wanted, ya know?"
1 Kings,5,11,"So Solomon hooked Hiram up with twenty thousand measures of wheat to keep his crew's stomachs satisfied, and twenty measures of top-notch oil. Solomon came through with the same deal for Hiram every year. (measures: Hebrew for 'cors')"
1 Kings,5,12,"So like, God totally hooked Solomon up with mad wisdom, just like He promised! And because of that, Solomon and Hiram were all chill with each other and even formed an alliance."
1 Kings,5,13,So King Solomon gathered a squad of thirty thousand dudes from all over Israel. (levy means they were basically compulsory recruits)
1 Kings,5,14,"And he like, sent them to Lebanon, like ten thousand peeps per month on rotation: they stay in Lebanon for a whole month, and then they chill at home for two months. And Adoniram was in charge of the whole recruitment process, yo."
1 Kings,5,15,"Solomon had 70,000 people carrying heavy stuff and 80,000 stone-cutters up in the mountains;"
1 Kings,5,16,"Yo, check it out, Solomon had about 3,300 boss officers in charge of all the work going on. They were the ones leading the people who were getting things done."
1 Kings,5,17,"So the king was like, 'Yo, bring me some dope stones - the expensive kind, you know? And make sure they're all nice and carved, we gotta lay down a solid foundation for this house.'"
1 Kings,5,18,"So, like, Solomon's crew and Hiram's team were like totally carving those stones, you know, getting them all ready to build the house, man. They were all about that timber and those stones, you feel me? #BuilderGang"
1 Kings,6,1,"So, like, it happened around 480 years after the Israelites left Egypt, during Solomon's fourth year as king of Israel. It was in the month of Zif, which is the second month, when he started building the house of the LORD."
1 Kings,6,2,"So King Solomon built this massive crib for the LORD, it was like 60 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 30 cubits tall. That's a whole lot of space for God to chill in!"
1 Kings,6,3,"The entrance area in front of the temple was twenty cubits long, just as wide as the temple itself. And it was ten cubits wide, extending out from the front of the house."
1 Kings,6,4,"And he put some really cool windows in the house. They were all sleek and modern, with a narrower design on the outside. #Aesthetic"
1 Kings,6,5,"He built rooms all around the walls of the house, both in the temple and in the sacred area. The rooms were connected to the wall and had multiple levels."
1 Kings,6,6,"The lowest level was like 5 cubits wide, the middle level was like 6 cubits wide, and the top level was like 7 cubits wide. Along the sides of the house, there were special spaces made so the beams didn't have to be attached to the walls."
1 Kings,6,7,"So, back when the house was being built, it was made with pre-cut stones. They brought these stones to the site, so there was no need for hammers, axes, or any iron tools to be used while the house was being built."
1 Kings,6,8,"The entrance to the middle room was on the right side of the house. They used cool spiral stairs to go up to the middle room, and then from there, they moved to the third room."
1 Kings,6,9,"So, like, he totally built the house and finished it, you know? And he covered the house with, like, beams and boards made out of super cool cedar. It was, like, top-notch craftsmanship, ya know? Oh, and the vault beams and panellings were also decked out in cedar, if you wanted to know."
1 Kings,6,10,"So, like, he totally constructed these cool rooms all around the house, about five cubits high, ya know? And they were supported by cedar wood, how rad is that?"
1 Kings,6,11,"So God hit up Solomon and was like,"
1 Kings,6,12,"Hey, about this house you're building, if you're down to follow my rules, do what's right, and keep all my commands, then I'll totally keep my promise to your dad David and hook you up."
1 Kings,6,13,"And I'll totally be chillin' with the peeps of Israel, like, I won't ever bail on my homies in Israel."
1 Kings,6,14,So Solomon totally constructed the crib and got it all decked out.
1 Kings,6,15,"So he like totally constructed the walls of the crib with cedar planks. And the floor and the ceiling were all decked out with those same cedar vibes. On the inside, he added some more wood vibes, and covered the floor with some fancy fir planks. It was a whole process, from floor to walls and all that jazz."
1 Kings,6,16,"And he made the sides of the house twenty cubits long, using cedar boards for both the floor and walls. He even crafted them inside the temple, specifically for the special room, which was the holiest place."
1 Kings,6,17,"And the crib, like, the mega church in front of it, was 40 units long."
1 Kings,6,18,"The inside of the house was totally decked out with groovy carved patterns and fresh flowers. Everything was made of cedar, no stone in sight. It was like those fancy gourd-shaped decorations and cool openings were giving it some extra flair, ya know?"
1 Kings,6,19,And he made a special room inside the house for the ark of the LORD's promise to be placed there.
1 Kings,6,20,"The thing upfront was 20 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 20 cubits tall. It was all blinged-out with pure gold, covering the cedar altar."
1 Kings,6,21,"So like, Solomon totally decked out the inside of the house with legit gold: and he put up this gold chain divider thingy in front of the holy place; and he covered it all in gold."
1 Kings,6,22,"And, like, the entire house was covered in gold, you know? It was like, super fancy. Oh, and they even gold-plated the whole altar that was by the oracle, too. So extra, but totally fabulous."
1 Kings,6,23,"And inside the special room, he crafted two cherubims out of olive tree, each standing ten cubits tall. (Olive tree: or oily; the Hebrew word can be interpreted both ways)."
1 Kings,6,24,"And the wings of the cherub measured five cubits on one side and five cubits on the other side. The total wingspan of the cherub was ten cubits, stretching from one edge of the wing to the other."
1 Kings,6,25,"And the other cool angel was like ten cubits, and both the angels were the same size and shape."
1 Kings,6,26,"The cherubs were like 10 feet tall, both of them."
1 Kings,6,27,And he placed the cherubims inside the main room. They spread out their wings so that one wing touched one wall and the other wing of the cherub touched the opposite wall. Their wings met in the center of the room.
1 Kings,6,28,And he flexed the cherubims with mad gold bling.
1 Kings,6,29,"And he totally flexed with those lit designs, carving mad cherubims, palm trees, and flowers all over the walls inside and out. You know, like, super dope open flowers and stuff. So fire, man. 🔥🌴"
1 Kings,6,30,"And he flexed on the house's floor, putting a sick layer of gold inside and out, no cap."
1 Kings,6,31,"And like, for the entrance of the special room, he crafted these totally dope olive tree doors. The lintel and side posts were like one fifth of the wall. And by one fifth, I mean they were fivesquare. How rad is that?"
1 Kings,6,32,"The two doors were made of olive tree wood, and designs of cherubims, palm trees, and blooming flowers were carved onto them. They were then covered with gold, spreading gold on the cherubims and the palm trees. (two...: or, leaves of the doors) (open flowers: Heb. openings of flowers)"
1 Kings,6,33,"He also made posts for the entrance of the temple out of olive wood. The posts were one quarter the size of the wall, and they were shaped like a square."
1 Kings,6,34,"Yo, check it out, the doors were made of fir tree. One door had two folding leaves, and the other door had two folding leaves too."
1 Kings,6,35,"Then he designed these sick cherubims, palm trees, and lit flowers on it. And he flexed by covering them with gold to perfectly match the carving."
1 Kings,6,36,"So, he like totally constructed the inner courtyard using these sick three rows of finely cut stone, and on top of that, he added a row of super trendy cedar beams."
1 Kings,6,37,"In the fourth year, they started building the house of the LORD in the month Zif:"
1 Kings,6,38,"And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was totally finished, with all its parts and according to its unique style. It took a solid seven years to build it."
1 Kings,7,1,"So, Solomon was like totally flexing and constructing his crib for thirteen years, and he straight up completed the whole dang thing."
1 Kings,7,2,"He also constructed the super cool house in Lebanon, it was like a hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits tall. It had four rows of epic cedar pillars with cedar beams on top of them."
1 Kings,7,3,"And the top was decked out with cedar planks resting upon forty-five pillars, fifteen in each row. (The term 'beams' means 'ribs' in Hebrew.)"
1 Kings,7,4,"There were three rows of windows, with lights aligned in three ranks. It looked pretty lit, with each light shining in perfect harmony."
1 Kings,7,5,"And all the doorways and frames were square with windows, and the light was arranged in three rows, matching light with light. (The doorways and frames were square when viewed from the front.)"
1 Kings,7,6,"Then he built a super cool entryway with these awesome pillars. It was like 50 cubits long and 30 cubits wide. The entrance was right in front, with more pillars and a really thick beam. It was all so rad."
1 Kings,7,7,"So he built this cool throne porch where he could make righteous judgments. It was like, the ultimate judgment spot with cedar covering the whole floor, from one side to the other. It was super stylish, man! (Hebrew version: like, top to bottom, floor to floor!)"
1 Kings,7,8,"And the place where he lived had another area with a cool entrance, which was designed similarly. Solomon also built a space for the daughter of Pharaoh, whom he married, that looked just like this entrance."
1 Kings,7,9,"All of these materials were super expensive, like, made from fancy stones that were cut perfectly with saws. They were used for everything, from the foundation to the highest part, even on the outside facing the big courtyard."
1 Kings,7,10,"And the base was made of super expensive stones, like huge stones that were ten cubits long and eight cubits wide."
1 Kings,7,11,"And there were really expensive stones, cut to perfection, and some really nice cedar wood up there too."
1 Kings,7,12,The whole court area was made up of three rows of smooth stones and a row of cedar beams. These were used for both the inner court of the house of the LORD and the porch of the house.
1 Kings,7,13,"So King Solomon hit up Hiram from Tyre and was like, 'Yo, come through.' (BTW, Hiram is also known as Huram.)"
1 Kings,7,14,"He was this guy, right, whose mom was a widow, and he was from the tribe of Naphtali. And his dad, man, he was a skilled worker from Tyre, all into making stuff with brass, you know? This dude was so wise, understanding, and had mad skills to do all kinds of brass work. Eventually, he met King Solomon and did all the awesome brass work for him. That's how he rolled, being the son of a widow and all."
1 Kings,7,15,"So he made these cool brass pillars, each one standing at a whopping eighteen cubits tall. And there was this slick design of twelve cubits that went all around each of them. (FYI: 'cast' means 'fashioned' in Hebrew)"
1 Kings,7,16,"Then he created two awesome brass caps to place on top of the pillars. Each cap was five cubits tall, just like the other one."
1 Kings,7,17,They made cool net patterns and dope chain designs for the decorative tops of the pillars. They had seven for one top and seven for the other top.
1 Kings,7,18,"And he made these dope pillars, and put two rows all around them, to cover the tops with this sick-looking network, and added some sick pomegranates too, just like he did for the other tops."
1 Kings,7,19,"And the cool decorative tops on the pillars were like lily flowers, so awesome! They were in the entrance, measuring four cubits."
1 Kings,7,20,"Yo, check it out! So, those dope chapiters on the two pillars had some sick pomegranate designs on top, right above the belly part where the network was. And get this, there were like two hundred pomegranates arranged in rows all around the other chapiter. Talk about a stylish touch, straight fire!"
1 Kings,7,21,"And he put the pillars by the entrance of the temple. He named the right one Jachin, which means 'He shall establish', and he named the left one Boaz, which means 'In it is strength'."
1 Kings,7,22,"And on the very top of the pillars there were beautiful flower designs, showing that the craftsmanship of the pillars was complete."
1 Kings,7,23,"So he created this big round pool, it was ten cubits from one end to the other, and it stood five cubits tall. A line of thirty cubits went all the way around it."
1 Kings,7,24,"And on the rim all around there were decorative knobs, ten within each cubit, encircling the sea all around. These decorative knobs were formed in two rows when the whole thing was cast."
1 Kings,7,25,"There were twelve oxen holding it up, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The sea was placed on top of them, and their backparts were all on the inside."
1 Kings,7,26,"It was, like, a handbreadth thick and the rim of it was designed to look like a cup rim with beautiful lily flowers. It could hold, like, a whopping two thousand baths!"
1 Kings,7,27,"And he built ten sick bases out of brass. Each base was four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits tall."
1 Kings,7,28,The bases were structured like this: they had edges and the edges were placed between the ledges.
1 Kings,7,29,"And on the edges of the ledges, there were these sick AF lions, oxen, and cherubims. And above the ledges was like a dope foundation, and beneath the lions and oxen, there were these rad decorations made of super intricate thin work."
1 Kings,7,30,"Each podium had four cool metal wheels and shiny brass plates. The four corners had sturdy supports, and under the sink were sleek support structures crafted like art. They totally rocked, just like the hip additions on the side."
1 Kings,7,31,"And the opening inside the top part was about a cubit wide: but the opening itself was circular, sculpted to match the design of the pedestal, a cubit and a half wide: and also around the opening there were engravings with their edges, square-shaped, not circular."
1 Kings,7,32,"And there were four wheels beneath the edges, and the axles of the wheels were attached to the base. The height of a wheel was one and a half cubits. The axles were attached to the base."
1 Kings,7,33,"The wheels were totally rad, like straight out of a cool chariot movie. The axles, hubs, rims, and spokes were all crafted with some sick molten skill."
1 Kings,7,34,"And, like, there were four super solid support thingies at the four corners of one foundation, and these support thingies were part of the foundation itself, like, inseparable."
1 Kings,7,35,"On top of the base, there was a cool circular thing about half a cubit high. And the ledges and borders on top of the base were totally matching."
1 Kings,7,36,"So, on the surfaces and edges of the plates, there were carvings of cherubims, lions, and palm trees. Each detail was perfectly proportioned, with additional decorative elements all around."
1 Kings,7,37,"Then he created the ten bases with all the same casting, measuring, and size."
1 Kings,7,38,"So he made ten big washbasins out of brass. Each washbasin held forty baths of water, and each washbasin was four cubits tall. He put one washbasin on top of each of the ten bases."
1 Kings,7,39,"Then he placed five bases on the right side of the crib, and five on the left side of the crib: and he placed the sea on the right side of the crib, facing the south in the east. {side: Heb. shoulder}"
1 Kings,7,40,"And Hiram was responsible for making the fancy sinks, fancy scoopers, and fancy bowls. He completed all the work that King Solomon asked him to do for the house of the LORD."
1 Kings,7,41,"The two pillars, and the two lit-looking bowls on top of them; and the two fancy nets, to cover the two bowls on top of the pillars;"
1 Kings,7,42,"And there were, like, 400 pomegranates for the two cool designs, ya know? Two rows of pomegranates for each design, to decorate the two bowls that were on top of the pillars. It was on the front side of the pillars, btw! 😎"
1 Kings,7,43,"And like, there were ten bases, and ten sick lavers on top of the bases, you feel me?"
1 Kings,7,44,"There was also this sick pool, and like, a bunch of big ox statues chilling beneath it, ya know?"
1 Kings,7,45,"And there were like, these sick pots, shovels, and basons - all these cool stuff that Hiram made for king Solomon's crib, you know? They were made out of shiny brass, like super polished and stuff."
1 Kings,7,46,"The king yeeted them into the flat area of Jordan, straight into the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan. {in...: Heb. in the thickness of the ground}"
1 Kings,7,47,"So Solomon didn't bother weighing all the stuff, 'cause there was so much of it! They couldn't even figure out how heavy the brass was. It was like, way too much to handle!"
1 Kings,7,48,"So Solomon made all the sick items for the house of the LORD: a sick gold altar, and a sick gold table for the yummy bread."
1 Kings,7,49,"Yo, there were these lit gold candlesticks, five on each side, flexin' in front of the oracle. They were all decked out with flowers, lamps, and gold tongs, no less."
1 Kings,7,50,"And there were these sick gold bowls, snuffers, basons, spoons, and censers, all shiny and pure. The hinges for the doors of the super holy place inside the house were also made of gold, along with the doors of the whole temple. Like, totally fancy stuff."
1 Kings,7,51,"And that's how everything king Solomon built for the house of the LORD was finished. Solomon also brought in the stuff his dad David had dedicated—like the silver, gold, and fancy things—and put them with the rest of the treasures in the house of the LORD. These were the special things that belonged to David."
1 Kings,8,1,"So Solomon gathered all the old heads of Israel, and the top guys from all the tribes, the big bosses of the Israelite families, to meet with King Solomon in Jerusalem. They wanted to bring the sacred ark that represents the LORD's promise out of David's city, also known as Zion."
1 Kings,8,2,"And like, all the dudes in Israel totally gathered around king Solomon during this lit feast in the month Ethanim, which, by the way, is the seventh month."
1 Kings,8,3,"So like, all the OGs of Israel rolled up, and the priests grabbed the ark, no cap."
1 Kings,8,4,"So they brought the ark of the LORD, the tabernacle, and all the sacred stuff that was in the tabernacle up, with the priests and the Levites leading the way."
1 Kings,8,5,"So like, King Solomon and all the squad from Israel gathered around him, you know, all swaggy in front of the ark and started flexing hard by sacrificing tons of sheep and oxen. There were so many, man, we lost count 'cause it was straight up lit!"
1 Kings,8,6,"Yo, the priests brought in the ark of the LORD's covenant to its spot, into the super sacred place in the house, right under the wings of the cherubims."
1 Kings,8,7,"So, like, the cherubims totally stretched out their two wings over the spot where the ark was, and they totally shielded the ark and its poles from above, you know."
1 Kings,8,8,"And they pulled out the poles, so that the ends of the poles were visible from within the sacred place in front of the special box, but not visible from outside. And there they remain even to this day. (ends: Hebrew: heads) (sacred place: or, ark)"
1 Kings,8,9,"The only thing in the ark were these two stone tablets that Moses put in there at Horeb, when the LORD made a deal with the Israelites after they dipped out of Egypt."
1 Kings,8,10,"So, like, after the priests left the sacred zone, a massive cloud totally filled up the LORD's crib."
1 Kings,8,11,"The priests couldn't even do their thing because of the thick cloud, cause the house of the LORD was filled with His glorious presence."
1 Kings,8,12,"So Solomon said, God said that he would live in total darkness."
1 Kings,8,13,I've totally hooked you up with a sick crib to crash at forever. It's the ultimate chill spot you won't wanna leave.
1 Kings,8,14,Then the king turned around and gave his blessings to all the peeps of Israel. (And all the peeps of Israel stood up;)
1 Kings,8,15,"And he was like, OMG, totally blessed is the LORD God of Israel, who like talked to David, my father, and like actually made it happen with his hands, and was like, 'I got this, yo!'"
1 Kings,8,16,"Ever since I freed my peeps, Israel, from Egypt, I didn't pick any random city from the tribes to build a crib for myself. Instead, I chose David to lead my fam, Israel."
1 Kings,8,17,"So, like, David, my dad, really wanted to construct a rad house for the name of the LORD God of Israel."
1 Kings,8,18,"And God was like, 'Yo David, my homie, I heard you wanted to build me a sick crib in your heart. That's pretty solid, man. Respect.'"
1 Kings,8,19,"But you won't be the one building the house, it'll be your future kid who's gonna do it in my name."
1 Kings,8,20,"So, like, God totally kept His word and everything, just as He said. And now, I'm taking over for my dad David and sitting on the throne of Israel, just like God promised. Plus, I've built this awesome house to honor the name of the LORD, the God of Israel."
1 Kings,8,21,"And I made a sick spot for the ark, like where the LORD's promise vibes at. He made it back in the day when he saved our ancestors from Egypt, you know?"
1 Kings,8,22,"So, Solomon was like, standing up in front of everyone, right by the altar of the LORD. And get this, it was in front of the whole Israel crew. He like, stretched out his hands toward heaven, you know?"
1 Kings,8,23,"And he was like, yo, LORD God of Israel, you're, like, the most epic God ever, in the whole heaven above and the earth beneath. You totally keep your promises and show mad love and kindness to your peeps who straight up walk before you with all their heart, no cap! 🙌"
1 Kings,8,24,"You've totally kept your promise to my dad, David. You spoke it and now you're makin' it happen, just like it is right now."
1 Kings,8,25,"Yo, LORD God of Israel, please hold up your promise to my dad David. You said there'd always be someone from his bloodline chillin' on the throne of Israel. So, it's like super important for your crew to stay on point and walk in your ways, just like my dad did."
1 Kings,8,26,"Yo, God of Israel, please make sure your word to my dad David comes true, like you said it would."
1 Kings,8,27,"Like, seriously, can God actually chill on earth? I mean, the whole universe, even the super fancy parts, can't even handle Him, so this house I built is like, way too small for Him, ya know?"
1 Kings,8,28,"But please listen to the prayer of your servant, O LORD my God. Pay attention to the requests and pleas that your servant is making today."
1 Kings,8,29,"So that you're always aware of this house, day and night, and especially of the special spot where you said, 'I'll put my name there.' That way, you'll be able to listen to the prayers that your servant makes in this place."
1 Kings,8,30,"Yo, listen up and pay attention to your servant's request and the prayers of your people Israel, when they pray towards this spot. Hear them out from your heavenly crib and when you actually listen, forgive them, you know. {or, like, in this place}"
1 Kings,8,31,"If someone does something wrong to their friend and is told to swear an oath, and they come to your altar in this house to take the oath:"
1 Kings,8,32,"So, like, listen up, God, and take action. You gotta judge your peeps, like, punish the bad ones and make them pay for their wrongdoings. But on the flip side, you gotta back up the good ones and reward them for being righteous, ya know, give 'em what they deserve."
1 Kings,8,33,"When your peeps, the Israelites, are totally wrecked by their enemies 'cause they messed up and went against you, but then they come back to you, confess your name, pray, and beg for your mercy in this place:"
1 Kings,8,34,"So like, listen up in heaven and forgive the mistakes of your people Israel, and like, bring them back to the land that you gave to their ancestors."
1 Kings,8,35,"When the sky is like, totally closed and there's no rain 'cause they messed up against you; if they send prayers in this direction and say sorry, and totally change their ways, when you're making them go through a tough time:"
1 Kings,8,36,"Yo, listen up in heaven, and like, forgive the wrongs of your peeps, both your servants and the Israel fam. Show 'em the lit path to follow and bless their land with rain, 'cause you gave it to them as an inheritance, ya know?"
1 Kings,8,37,"If, like, there's a serious lack of food in the area, or if there's like, a major outbreak of some nasty disease, or if crops are getting messed up by things like intense weather or annoying bugs, or if the people are getting attacked by their enemies in their own cities, or pretty much any kind of bad situation or sickness that happens, ya know?"
1 Kings,8,38,"Whenever someone, like, prays or asks for something, whether it's just one person or, like, all the cool people in Israel, and they're, like, totally aware of the struggles deep inside their hearts, and they, like, raise their hands towards this place, you know:"
1 Kings,8,39,"Okay, listen up, God, as you kick it in your heavenly crib. Like, forgive us and stuff, and do your thing, and hook everyone up based on how they roll, since you totally know what's up with their hearts (and seriously, you're the only one who knows what's going on in our hearts, all us humans)."
1 Kings,8,40,So they'll respect You as long as they live in the land You gave to our ancestors.
1 Kings,8,41,"Oh, and when it comes to someone who's not from your crew, ya know, not one of your homies from Israel but someone from a far-off land who's all about repping your name..."
1 Kings,8,42,"Cuz people gonna hear about how awesome you are, how you flex with your strength, and how you throw out your power, when they come and pray towards this place."
1 Kings,8,43,"Yo, listen up from your heavenly crib and grant every request that comes your way, even from the outsider. The goal is for everyone on this planet to recognize your name and respect you, just like the people of Israel do. And they gotta know that this epic house I built is named after you. Like, your name is literally on it!"
1 Kings,8,44,"When your squad goes into a battle against their rival, wherever you send them, they should hit up the LORD, facing the city you picked, and showing love towards the house I built for your name. (the way of the city: in other words, straight to the heart of it!)"
1 Kings,8,45,"So, like, listen up, man. When they pray and ask for stuff, you gotta be there, y'know? Take their side and support them. #NoDoubt"
1 Kings,8,46,"If they mess up and do wrong (because let's face it, everyone messes up sometimes), and you get mad at them and let the enemy take them captive to their territory, whether it's far away or nearby,"
1 Kings,8,47,"But, like, if they like stop and really think about it in the place where they got taken as captives, and they genuinely feel sorry and ask for forgiveness in the same place where they were taken captives, saying, 'Yo, we messed up big time and did some seriously messed up stuff; we were totally wicked.'"
1 Kings,8,48,"And they'll come back to you with their whole heart and soul, even if they're stuck in their enemies' land who took them as captives. They'll pray towards the land you gave to their ancestors, the city you picked, and the house I made for your name."
1 Kings,8,49,"So like, listen up, hear their prayer and supplication in heaven, where you dwell, and make sure they get what they deserve. #justice"
1 Kings,8,50,"And forgive your people for messing up and doing wrong against you, and for all the times they messed up and went against you. Show them kindness, especially to those who have them under control, so that they might also show them kindness in return."
1 Kings,8,51,"Because they're, like, totally yours, the people you rescued from the land of Egypt, where life was as tough as being stuck in a scorching iron furnace."
1 Kings,8,52,"So that you'll totally listen to your servant's prayers and the prayers of your people Israel, and give them what they ask for."
1 Kings,8,53,"You picked them out from everyone else on earth, to be Yours and only Yours, just like You told Moses. Remember when You rescued our ancestors from Egypt, God?"
1 Kings,8,54,"So, like, after Solomon finished praying this whole deep prayer to the LORD, he got up from the altar of the LORD where he was kneeling with his hands raised up to the sky."
1 Kings,8,55,"So he stood up and gave a big shoutout to all the squad of Israel, like yo, saying,"
1 Kings,8,56,"Praise the LORD, who's totally hooked us up with some chill vibes and brought peace to his crew, the peeps of Israel. He stayed true to every single promise, not even one of his awesome words fell through the cracks. He dropped all those promises to Moses, his main servant, and didn't let us down. 🙌"
1 Kings,8,57,"May God be with us, just like he was with our ancestors. May he never abandon or desert us."
1 Kings,8,58,"So our hearts can vibe with Him, and we stay loyal to His ways, following His rules, decrees, and judgments just like our ancestors were told to do."
1 Kings,8,59,"And may these words of mine, which I've prayed before the LORD, always be close to our God day and night. May He support His servant and the people of Israel in every situation that arises. (Heb. as needed for each day)"
1 Kings,8,60,"So, like, everyone should know that the LORD is totally God and no one else can even come close."
1 Kings,8,61,"So, like, make sure your heart is totally aligned with the LORD our God, you know? Walk the talk and keep His commandments, just like we're doing it right now."
1 Kings,8,62,"And the king, along with all of Israel, flexed their worship game in front of the LORD."
1 Kings,8,63,"So Solomon flexed big time with a sacrifice to the LORD, yo. He dropped 22k oxen and 120k sheep on the table. And you know what, the king and all the peeps of Israel were like, 'This is lit!' They dedicated the LORD's crib."
1 Kings,8,64,"On that day, the king made the middle of the court in front of the house of the LORD sacred. He offered burnt offerings, meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings there because the bronze altar in front of the LORD wasn't big enough to handle all the offerings."
1 Kings,8,65,"So like, back then, Solomon threw this massive feast party, right? And I'm talking huge! Everyone in Israel came, from Hamath to the river of Egypt, to celebrate and honor the Lord our God. And get this, the party went on for a solid fourteen days - a whole two weeks of absolute celebration!"
1 Kings,8,66,"On the eighth day, he let the people go home. They shouted praises to the king and went back to their cribs, feeling super stoked and happy because of all the awesome things that the LORD had done for David, his right-hand man, and for the people of Israel. They were totally grateful, dude!"
1 Kings,9,1,"After Solomon was done flexing with the mad sick crib he built for the Lord's house, and his own pad for the king, just as he wished and vibed with."
1 Kings,9,2,"So, like, Solomon was chilling when the LORD showed up again, just like the first time at Gibeon."
1 Kings,9,3,"And God was like, yo dude, I totally heard your prayer and the stuff you asked for. This place you built is sacred, I've claimed it as my own and I'm gonna keep it that way forever. And just so you know, I'll always be watching and caring about what happens there, no cap."
1 Kings,9,4,"And if you wanna be like David, your dad, and live with integrity and do what I tell you to do, and follow my rules and guidelines:"
1 Kings,9,5,"So basically, I'm gonna make sure that your kingdom in Israel is gonna last forever, just like I promised your dad David. Trust me, there's always gonna be someone ruling over Israel, no doubt about it."
1 Kings,9,6,"If y'all totally start straying away from following me, like you or your homies, and refuse to keep my rules and regulations that I've dropped on you, but instead start simpin' over other deities and flexin' on 'em:"
1 Kings,9,7,"Yo, I'm gonna straight up remove Israel from the land I blessed them with. The crib I made sacred for my name? Yeah, I'm gonna kick it outta my view. And Israel? They're gonna become like a famous saying, a word people use to mock."
1 Kings,9,8,"And when they see this lit house, everyone who walks by will be shook and be like, 'Whoa!' They'll be talking, like, 'Why did God do all this crazy stuff to this place and the crib?'"
1 Kings,9,9,"And they will be like, 'Dude, it's because they totally ditched the LORD their God, who rescued their ancestors from Egypt, and started clinging onto other gods, worshiping and serving them. So, that's why the LORD brought all this evil upon them, you know? No hate, just facts.'"
1 Kings,9,10,"So, after like, 20 whole years, when Solomon finished building the two rad houses - the house of the LORD and the king's crib -"
1 Kings,9,11,"So, like, King Hiram of Tyre totally hooked Solomon up with some sick cedar trees, fir trees, and gold, just how Solomon wanted it. And in return, Solomon gave Hiram twenty lit cities in Galilee land. Talk about a rad trade!"
1 Kings,9,12,"So Hiram rolled up to check out the cities that Solomon hooked him up with, but they were just not his vibe. Like, they totally didn't meet his standards, you know?"
1 Kings,9,13,"And he's like, dude, what's up with these cities you gave me, bro? So, he named them Cabul, which basically means they're gross and disappointing, and that name stuck till today."
1 Kings,9,14,"And Hiram DM'd the king with, like, 120 talents of gold."
1 Kings,9,15,"So basically, King Solomon needed some funds to build the house of the LORD, his own crib, and some other cool stuff like Millo, the wall of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer."
1 Kings,9,16,"So, like, Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, went and attacked Gezer, totally burnt it down and killed all the Canaanite peeps living there. And get this, he then decided to gift the city to his daughter, who's actually Solomon's wife."
1 Kings,9,17,"So like, Solomon totally built Gezer and Bethhoron below,"
1 Kings,9,18,"Whoa, check out Baalath and Tadmor, they're like in the middle of nowhere, out in the wild lands!"
1 Kings,9,19,"Solomon had a ton of cities, like seriously stacked with places for his fancy chariots and sick horsemen. He was all about building cool stuff in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and every inch of his territory. Man, he really wanted to make it happen, ya know?"
1 Kings,9,20,"And all the peeps that were still around from the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who weren't part of the children of Israel,"
1 Kings,9,21,"So, like, there were some kids left in the land that the Israelite children couldn't totally wipe out, right? Well, Solomon decided to make them pay up and work as servants to this very day. It's like a tribute or something, you know?"
1 Kings,9,22,"But Solomon didn't enslave any of the Israelites. They were all warriors, his loyal crew, their leaders, and the ones in charge of his cool chariots and horse squad."
1 Kings,9,23,"So basically, these were the main boss dudes who were in charge of all the work that Solomon was doing. There were like 550 of them, and they were the ones calling the shots and overseeing all the people doing the actual work."
1 Kings,9,24,"So, Pharaoh's daughter moved into the house that Solomon built for her in the city of David, and then he went ahead and built Millo."
1 Kings,9,25,"So, like, three times a year, Solomon would offer burnt offerings and peace offerings on this sick altar he built for the LORD, and he'd burn some lit incense on the altar that was right in front of the LORD. And boom! He finished the whole house."
1 Kings,9,26,"King Solomon flexed and built a whole fleet of ships in Eziongeber, right next to Eloth, on the Red Sea coast in the Edom region. It was lit, fam! 🔥"
1 Kings,9,27,"So Hiram sent his squad of experienced sailors on his dope navy, along with Solomon's crew."
1 Kings,9,28,So they went to Ophir and got four hundred and twenty talents of gold and brought it back to King Solomon.
1 Kings,10,1,"So, like, word got out about how amazing Solomon was and how he was all about praising the LORD. The queen of Sheba was like, 'I need to see if this guy's legit,' so she came and hit him up with some seriously tough questions."
1 Kings,10,2,"And she pulled up to Jerusalem with a massive crew, rolling in on some camels carrying all the fancy spices, loads of gold, and precious bling. Once she reached Solomon, she sat down and had a deep conversation about everything on her mind."
1 Kings,10,3,"Solomon answered all of her questions without holding back anything. He didn't keep any secrets from her, spillin' all the tea like a boss."
1 Kings,10,4,"And like, when the queen of Sheba checked out all of Solomon's mad wisdom, and the sick crib he built,"
1 Kings,10,5,"And all the food on his table, the way his servants were sitting, the way his ministers were serving, their clothes, his personal drink servers, and the path he took to go up to the house of the LORD - it left her speechless and amazed. {attendance: in other words, standing} {cupbearers: or, butlers}"
1 Kings,10,6,"Yo, King, gotta tell you, word on the street was true about your mad skills and wisdom back in my own land. No cap. {report: Hebrew translation is 'word'} {acts: or, sayings}"
1 Kings,10,7,"But I didn't believe it, until I actually saw it with my own eyes. And let me tell you, it was even better than what I had heard. Your wisdom and success totally surpass the hype!"
1 Kings,10,8,"Blessed are your squad, so blessed are these your loyal peeps who stay by your side, always vibing with your wisdom."
1 Kings,10,9,"Praise the LORD your God, who totally vibes with you and chose you to be the ruler of Israel because he's always loved Israel and wanted you to bring fairness and justice."
1 Kings,10,10,"And she hooked up the king with like, a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and like, a ton of spices and precious stones. Yo, there ain't never been no stash of spices like the ones the queen of Sheba blessed king Solomon with."
1 Kings,10,11,"And Hiram's navy, who brought gold from Ophir, also brought in a ton of almug trees and precious stones from Ophir. (By the way, almug trees are also known as algum trees.)"
1 Kings,10,12,"The king used super cool almug trees to make pillars for the house of the LORD and the king's crib. He also had some sick harps and psalteries for the singers. People hadn't even seen those almug trees before, they were that rare."
1 Kings,10,13,"King Solomon hooked up the queen of Sheba with everything she wanted, no cap. He gave her whatever she asked for, on top of what he already gave her from his royal stash. Then she bounced and went back to her own country with her crew. (FYI: Solomon really hooked her up, no lie)"
1 Kings,10,14,"So, like, Solomon received this insane amount of gold in just one year, man. It was, like, six hundred and sixty talents of gold! Can you even imagine that? So epic, dude!"
1 Kings,10,15,"In addition to the stuff he got from all the cool merchant peeps, the spice traders, and even the bosses from Arabia and the local rulers/captains. Ya know, lots of goodies!"
1 Kings,10,16,"King Solomon flexed with two hundred gold targets, each worth six hundred shekels of gold."
1 Kings,10,17,"So this dude totally crafted like 300 sick golden shields. Each shield took a hefty three pounds of gold to make, man! Then the king just stashed 'em in this badass crib called the House of the Forest of Lebanon, no biggie."
1 Kings,10,18,"And the king flexed with this sick throne made of ivory, all blinged out with the finest gold."
1 Kings,10,19,"The throne had, like, six steps, and the top of the throne was rounded at the back. And there were these cool supports on both sides of the seat, with two lions standing beside them. (By the way, 'behind' in Hebrew means on the back part, and 'stays' means hands.)"
1 Kings,10,20,"And there were, like, twelve fierce lions chillin' on both sides of the six steps, man. No other kingdom had anything as rad as that. {so: like, it's crazy}"
1 Kings,10,21,"So like, all of King Solomon's drinking cups were made of gold, and all the fancy cups in the Lebanese forest palace were pure gold too! They didn't even bother with silver back then, it didn't matter to them at all."
1 Kings,10,22,"The king had a sick navy with the king of Hiram at sea: every three years the sick navy would roll in, bringing loads of gold, silver, fancy ivory, cool apes, and stunning peacocks. {ivory: or, elephants' teeth}"
1 Kings,10,23,"King Solomon was, like, the ultimate flex when it came to being rich and wise, no other kings could even come close."
1 Kings,10,24,"So basically, people from all over the place were flocking to Solomon because they heard he was super wise, thanks to God dropping that wisdom in his heart."
1 Kings,10,25,"So everyone came bringing their gifts: awesome silver and gold stuff, cool clothes, sick armor and weapons, fancy spices, swift horses, and fresh rides, like every single year!"
1 Kings,10,26,"So, Solomon flexed by having a whole army of chariots and horsemen. Picture this: he had, like, a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. He spread them out in different cities, you know, to have chariot fun, and he kept some by his side in Jerusalem, right alongside him."
1 Kings,10,27,"And the king hooked up Jerusalem with silver, like it was made out of cool rocks, and he hooked up the cedars, making them as awesome as the sycomore trees in the valley because there were mad amounts of them. (made: means he gave)"
1 Kings,10,28,"So like, Solomon brought in some dope horses from Egypt, along with some fresh linen threads. The king's merchants bought the linen threads at a decent price, ya know?"
1 Kings,10,29,"Then someone brought a sick ride out of Egypt, worth 600 silver coins, and a dope horse for 150. They made mad profit by supplying fancy rides to the kings of the Hittites and Syria."
1 Kings,11,1,"Yo, King Solomon was all about dating a ton of different women, like the pharaoh's daughter, hotties from Moab, Ammon, Edom, Sidon, and the Hittites. Dude was expanding his options, ya feel me?"
1 Kings,11,2,"God told the Israelites not to mingle with other nations, as they will lead you astray with their different beliefs. But Solomon fell in love with them and embraced their gods."
1 Kings,11,3,"So, like, the dude had 700 wives who were all fancy princesses, and 300 side chicks. And, well, let's just say all those ladies kinda messed with his heart."
1 Kings,11,4,"So like, when Solomon got all old, his wives started tempting him to follow other gods and stuff. And yeah, his heart wasn't totally in sync with the LORD his God, unlike David his dad who had a way more loyal heart."
1 Kings,11,5,"So, like, Solomon was totally into worshipping Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Zidonians, and Milcom, who was like a major abomination to the Ammonites. BTW, Milcom is also known as Molech."
1 Kings,11,6,"So, like, Solomon, he didn't exactly do the right things in the eyes of the LORD, you know? He didn't fully follow the LORD like his dad David did. Like, he didn't totally do what he was supposed to."
1 Kings,11,7,"So, Solomon went ahead and built a really cool spot for worshipping Chemosh, which the Moabites thought was super awesome, on this hill right in front of Jerusalem. And he also built another spot for worshipping Molech, which the Ammonites were really into. But let's make it clear, these deities were considered abominations to God."
1 Kings,11,8,"And he did the same thing for all his non-traditional wives, who worshipped and made offerings to their gods."
1 Kings,11,9,"God was so mad at Solomon because he started ghosting the Lord God of Israel, even though they had major face time twice!"
1 Kings,11,10,"And like, God was all like, yo dude, don't be chasing after other gods, but like, he totally did not listen to God and did his own thing, you know what I'm saying?"
1 Kings,11,11,"So, the LORD was like, 'Yo, Solomon, since you went and messed up by not keeping my covenant and obeying my rules that I specifically told you, I'm gonna have to take the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your servants. Just sayin'.'"
1 Kings,11,12,"But don't worry, during your lifetime I won't do it because of your dad David. I'll take it away from your son instead."
1 Kings,11,13,"But, like, I'm not gonna totally split up the whole kingdom or whatever. I'm gonna let your son have just one tribe, you know, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city I've chosen."
1 Kings,11,14,"And God caused a rival to rise against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was a descendant of the king in Edom."
1 Kings,11,15,"So, like, David was chilling in Edom, right? And Joab, the boss of the army, went up to bury the dead dudes after he totally defeated every guy in Edom. No cap!"
1 Kings,11,16,"(So Joab and all of Israel stayed in Edom for six months, until they had eliminated every male from the land: )"
1 Kings,11,17,"So Hadad and some of his father's Edomite servants escaped and went to Egypt. At that time, Hadad was just a young kid."
1 Kings,11,18,"So they bounced out of Midian and pulled up to Paran, bringing some homies from Paran with them. They rolled up to Egypt, straight to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. And guess what? Pharaoh hooked them up with a crib, food on deck, and even some land."
1 Kings,11,19,"Hadad was, like, totally liked by Pharaoh and got to marry the sister of his own wife, who was Tahpenes, the queen's sister."
1 Kings,11,20,"And Tahpenes' sister gave birth to Genubath, her son, who was raised in Pharaoh's house. Genubath grew up among Pharaoh's sons in the royal household."
1 Kings,11,21,"So, like, when Hadad found out in Egypt that David had passed away and Joab, the commander of the army, was no more, Hadad went to Pharaoh and was like, 'Yo, dude, let me bounce and go back to my own country.' And Hadad was straight-up asking Pharaoh to let him go, you know what I'm saying."
1 Kings,11,22,"So Pharaoh's like, why you wanna bounce back to your homeland? Did I not treat you well enough or something? And the dude's like, nah dude, nothing's lacking, but I still gotta dip, you know? Let me go, fam, no biggie. {Nothing: Heb. Not}"
1 Kings,11,23,"And God caused another enemy to rise up against him, Rezon, son of Eliadah, who had fled from his master Hadadezer, the king of Zobah:"
1 Kings,11,24,"So, basically, David got a bunch of guys together and became the leader of a crew. They went and defeated some people from Zobah, then settled down in Damascus and took charge over there."
1 Kings,11,25,"And this guy was, like, constantly causing problems for Israel while Solomon was in charge. Not to mention all the trouble that Hadad guy caused. He totally hated Israel and ruled over Syria."
1 Kings,11,26,"So there was this guy named Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who was from Zereda. He used to be Solomon's servant and his mom, Zeruah, was a widow. But here's the crazy part - Jeroboam actually rebelled against the king, and even raised his hand against him."
1 Kings,11,27,"And this is why he went against the king: Solomon built up Millo and fixed the broken parts of the city that belonged to his dad, David."
1 Kings,11,28,"Jeroboam was like, super strong and skilled, and Solomon, peeping that this dude was hardworking, put him in charge of everything related to the house of Joseph. Like, all the responsibilities and stuff."
1 Kings,11,29,"So, like, one day Jeroboam was leaving Jerusalem, right? And then this prophet dude named Ahijah the Shilonite, he comes across Jeroboam on the way. And get this, Jeroboam was rocking some fresh new clothes. And, yo, they were all alone in the field, just the two of them."
1 Kings,11,30,And Ahijah grabbed the sick outfit that was on him and tore it into twelve pieces:
1 Kings,11,31,"And he was like, yo Jeroboam, snag yourself ten chunks, ‘cause the LORD, the God of Israel, was like, check it out, I’m about to snatch the kingdom away from Solomon and hook you up with ten tribes, fam:"
1 Kings,11,32,"But yo, there gonna be one tribe holdin' it down for my homie David and for Jerusalem, the city I picked outta all the tribes of Israel."
1 Kings,11,33,"So like, they totally ditched me and started idolizing Ashtoreth, the queen of the Zidonians, Chemosh, the god of the Moabites, and Milcom, the god of the Ammonites. They're not even following my ways or doing what's right in my eyes, unlike David, their OG king who stayed on track with my rules and decisions."
1 Kings,11,34,"But I'm not gonna totally strip him of his kingdom, instead, I'll let him be in charge as prince for the rest of his life. All because of David, my loyal servant, who I picked 'cause he always followed my rules and regulations."
1 Kings,11,35,"But I'm gonna snatch that kingdom away from his kid and hand it over to you, like, ten tribes in total."
1 Kings,11,36,"And I'll give one tribe to his son, so that David, my servant, can always have a cool vibe in Jerusalem, the city where I decided to make my presence known. {cool vibe: Hebrew - lit. lamp, or, candle}"
1 Kings,11,37,"And like, I've got you, fam. You're gonna have the ultimate power and be the boss, ruling Israel and making all your dreams come true."
1 Kings,11,38,"Yo, if you're down to listen to everything I tell you, and you actually live your life in a way that pleases me, following my rules and doing what's right, just like David did, then I got your back. I'll make sure you have a stable and secure life, just like I did for David, and I'll even give you control over Israel."
1 Kings,11,39,"And I'm gonna totally cause some trouble for the descendants of David, but it won't last forever, I promise."
1 Kings,11,40,"So, like, Solomon was totally out to get Jeroboam. And Jeroboam was like, 'No way, dude!' and peaced out to Egypt to chill with King Shishak. He stayed there until Solomon passed away."
1 Kings,11,41,"Yo, there's so much more that Solomon did, his crazy amazing moves and his insane wisdom, isn't it all written down in the book of Solomon's epic journey? Like, seriously, it's all there - every single cool thing he said and did."
1 Kings,11,42,"So Solomon was the ruler of all Israel in Jerusalem for a solid forty years. Like, this dude was in charge and running the show for a pretty long time. You know, just putting it out there, 'cause it's worth mentioning. Oh, and by the way, when they say timee', they mean 'days'. No biggie, just a little language tidbit for you. Peace out!"
1 Kings,11,43,"So, Solomon passed away and was laid to rest in the same city as his father, David. Then, his son Rehoboam took over as the ruler in his place. {Rehoboam: BTW, in Greek, his name is Roboam}"
1 Kings,12,1,"So Rehoboam went to Shechem, because all of Israel had gathered there to make him king."
1 Kings,12,2,"So, like, Jeroboam, Nebat's son, who was still in Egypt at the time, heard about it, ya know? 'Cause he had run away from king Solomon and was living in Egypt and stuff."
1 Kings,12,3,"So they hit up Jeroboam and the whole Israel squad was like, 'Yo, Rehoboam, we gotta talk,'"
1 Kings,12,4,"Your dad made our workload unbearable. So, like, could you, like, make his super heavy workload easier for us? If you do that, we'll totally be loyal to you."
1 Kings,12,5,"And he's like, yo, peace out for three days, then come back and see me. And the squad dipped."
1 Kings,12,6,"So, like, King Rehoboam chilled with the OGs who used to be with his dad, King Solomon, back in the day. And he was like, 'Yo, guys, I need your opinion on how to respond to these peeps. What's the move?'"
1 Kings,12,7,"And they were like, 'Yo, if you're down to be all about serving these people today and catering to them, speaking kind and positive vibes to them, then they'll be ride or die for you forever.'"
1 Kings,12,8,"But he ignored the advice from the wise elders and turned to his squad of homies, who were his day ones and always by his side:"
1 Kings,12,9,"And he's like, yo dudes, what's your advice on how to respond to these peeps? They're all like, 'Dude, make the burden your dad laid on us less heavy, bro.'"
1 Kings,12,10,"So, like, the dudes who were homies with him, they spoke to him and were like, 'Yo bro, here's how you should talk to the people who were complaining about your dad, saying he made their lives suck. Just tell them that your pinky finger is stronger than your dad's whole body.'"
1 Kings,12,11,"So, like, my dad totally burdened you with this super heavy weight, right? Well, guess what? I'm gonna make it even worse for you. He used whips to punish you before, but I'm gonna use freaking scorpions!"
1 Kings,12,12,"So Jeroboam and all the peeps came to Rehoboam on the third day, like the king had planned, straight up saying, 'Slide through again on the third day, fam.'"
1 Kings,12,13,"And the king totally dissed the people, not taking the advice of the old folks who had his back; {roughly: like, seriously}"
1 Kings,12,14,"So I talked to them, taking advice from the homies, and I was like, yo, my dad totally made your life super hard, but guess what? I'm about to make it even harder. Like, my dad used to punish you with whips, but I'm gonna bring out the scorpions for real."
1 Kings,12,15,"So, like, the king didn't listen to the people because, ya know, that was all part of God's plan. God wanted to make sure His words came true, the ones He told Ahijah the Shilonite to speak to Jeroboam, Nebat's son and everything."
1 Kings,12,16,"So, like, when all of Israel saw that the king wasn't listening to them, the people were like, 'What's our deal with David? We don't get anything from being Jesse's son. It's time for you, David, to take care of your own house.' And then Israel peaced out and went back to their tents."
1 Kings,12,17,"So, like, the Israelites who were living in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam was their king and all."
1 Kings,12,18,"So King Rehoboam sent Adoram, the guy in charge of taxes, and all of Israel literally pelted him with stones until he died. So, King Rehoboam quickly hopped into his fancy chariot and got the heck out of there, heading straight to Jerusalem."
1 Kings,12,19,"So Israel totally ghosted the house of David up until now. {ghosted: or, ditched}"
1 Kings,12,20,"So, like, everyone in Israel found out that Jeroboam came back and they were all like, 'Yo, let's gather and make this dude our king over the whole country.' And legit, the house of David had no followers except for the tribe of Judah. #loyalty"
1 Kings,12,21,"So, when Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he gathered all the peeps from the tribe of Judah and Benjamin – a whopping 180,000 fearless warriors – ready to battle against the house of Israel and put Rehoboam, Solomon's son, back in charge of the kingdom."
1 Kings,12,22,"So God straight up messaged Shemaiah, who's a real devout dude, and He was like,"
1 Kings,12,23,"Yo, listen up Rehoboam, bro of Solomon, king of Judah! And not just you, but also all the peeps in Judah and Benjamin, and even the leftover crowd, here's what I gotta say to ya,"
1 Kings,12,24,"Listen up, fam. God says, 'Don't even think about attacking your fellow Israelites. Head back home and chill, because this situation is all part of my plan.' So, these peeps actually listened to what God said and decided to bounce, just like He told them."
1 Kings,12,25,So Jeroboam decided to build up Shechem in the mountains of Ephraim and made it his crib. Then he bounced from there and also built up Penuel.
1 Kings,12,26,"So Jeroboam thought to himself, like, oh great, now the kingdom's gonna go back to David's fam:"
1 Kings,12,27,"If these people go to worship at the LORD's crib in Jerusalem, they'll simp for Rehoboam, the king of Judah, and they'll be ready to cancel me and flock back to Rehoboam, the king of Judah."
1 Kings,12,28,"So the king was like, 'Yo, I got an idea!' He gathered some peeps to help him make two lit golden calves. Then he was all like, 'Listen up, Israel! Going all the way to Jerusalem is a hassle. Check out these gods who totally brought you out of Egypt!'"
1 Kings,12,29,"So he placed one in Bethel, and the other in Dan."
1 Kings,12,30,"And this became a problem: because people started going to worship in only one place, even all the way to Dan."
1 Kings,12,31,"And he built a lit AF crib with sick views, and appointed some regular dudes as priests, even though they weren't from the crew of Levi."
1 Kings,12,32,"And Jeroboam threw a lit party in the eighth month, exactly on the fifteenth day, just like the fire festival they have in Judah. He went all out and offered sacrifices on the altar. He did the same in Bethel, sacrificing to the handmade idols he had made. He even put his own team of priests in charge of the high places he created."
1 Kings,12,33,"So he went up to the altar he made in Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, a totally made-up month that he came up with himself. He threw a party for the Israeli kids and burnt incense on the altar."
1 Kings,13,1,"Yo, check it out, this dude who's tight with God came from Judah rollin' with a message straight from the LORD to Bethel. Jeroboam was chillin' by the altar, 'bout to light up some incense, ya feel?"
1 Kings,13,2,"And he totally called out the altar like, in the word of the LORD, and was like, yo altar, listen up! This is what the LORD says - get ready, 'cause a child named Josiah is gonna be born into the house of David. And guess what? He's gonna straight up offer those priests who burn incense on you, and even burn men's bones on you, okay? It's gonna go down, no joke."
1 Kings,13,3,"So, like, this dude was all like, 'Yo, check it out! God said there's gonna be a sick sign today. The altar is gonna straight up split in half, and all the ashes on it are gonna spill out.'"
1 Kings,13,4,"So, like, King Jeroboam heard what the man of God said when he was calling out the altar in Bethel. And then he got all upset and stretched out his hand from the altar, telling his dudes to grab the man. But, surprise surprise, his hand dried up and he couldn't pull it back to himself anymore."
1 Kings,13,5,"Yo, peep this: the altar straight up got wrecked, and the ashes just spilled out all over the place, just like the dude of God said would happen 'cause of the word of the LORD."
1 Kings,13,6,"Then the king replied to the man of God, like, 'Yo, could you please ask your God and pray for me, so that my hand can be healed and all? And the man of God prayed to the Lord, and boom, the king's hand was totally restored and back to normal, just like before!"
1 Kings,13,7,"And the king was like, hey, dude of God, come chill at my crib and take a break, and I'll hook you up with a sick prize."
1 Kings,13,8,"The man of God straight up told the king, like, bro, if you're down to give me half of your crib, I'm still not vibin' with you. I ain't eatin' or drinkin' anything in this spot."
1 Kings,13,9,"The LORD told me not to eat or drink anything, and not to go back the same way I came."
1 Kings,13,10,"So he took a different path, and didn't go back the way he came to Bethel."
1 Kings,13,11,"So, there was this OG prophet chilling in Bethel. And his sons peeped all the epic stuff the man of God pulled off that day in Bethel: they spilled the tea on the boss words he dropped on the king, and they made sure to tell their pops about it too."
1 Kings,13,12,"And their dad was like, yo, which way did that dude go? 'Cause his sons peeped where the man of God went, who came from Judah."
1 Kings,13,13,"And he was like, yo sons, get me that donkey. So they hooked him up with the donkey, and he rode off on it,"
1 Kings,13,14,"So, they chased after the man of God and, like, totally found him chilling under this huge oak tree. And they're like, 'Yo, are you that dude who came all the way from Judah and stuff?' And the man of God's like, 'Yeah, bruh, that's me.'"
1 Kings,13,15,"And he was like, 'Yo, come chill at my crib and grub some bread.'"
1 Kings,13,16,"And he's like, 'Nah, I can't roll with you or chill with you: I won't even grab a bite or sip water with you here.'"
1 Kings,13,17,The LORD told me not to eat any bread or drink water there and not to go back the way I came.
1 Kings,13,18,"He was like, 'Dude, I'm a prophet just like you. And an angel came to me, straight from the LORD, saying, 'Take him back to your place so he can have some food and water.' But he totally lied to him."
1 Kings,13,19,"So he went with him, and they grabbed a bite to eat at his place, and chilled with some water."
1 Kings,13,20,"So, like, they were just chilling at the table when the LORD straight up spoke to the prophet who brought him back:"
1 Kings,13,21,"And he called out to the dude of God who came from Judah, like, 'Yo, the LORD says, because you straight up ignored what He said and didn't do the commandment He gave you,"
1 Kings,13,22,"But like, you totally turned back and went and had some food and drinks at that spot even though the Lord clearly told you not to, saying 'Don't eat any bread or drink any water', and now you won't even have a proper burial alongside your ancestors, man."
1 Kings,13,23,"And it happened, after he finished chowing down and guzzling, he got the ride ready, specifically for the prophet he had brought back."
1 Kings,13,24,"Yo, so this dude was just minding his own business, when out of nowhere, a lion rolls up and straight up takes him out. The guy's dead body gets thrown onto the road, and his poor donkey just stands there next to it, while the lion hangs around too."
1 Kings,13,25,"So, like, these dudes were walking and they saw a dead body just chilling on the road, and there was a lion hanging around near it. They were like, 'Yo, we gotta tell the old prophet who lives in the city about this, it's crazy!'"
1 Kings,13,26,"And when the prophet who brought him back heard about it, he said, 'Yo, it's the man of God who straight up ignored the word of the LORD. So the LORD let him be taken by a lion, which totally ripped him apart, just like the LORD said it would.'"
1 Kings,13,27,"And he was like, yo, kids! Get the donkey ready. So they hooked the donkey up, just like he asked, no questions asked."
1 Kings,13,28,"So he went and came across his dead body lying on the road, with the donkey and the lion standing next to it. The lion hadn't eaten the body and hadn't harmed the donkey either. {torn: in Hebrew, it means broken}"
1 Kings,13,29,"So the prophet picked up the dead body of the man of God and placed it on the donkey, then took it back. And the older prophet went to the city to grieve and give him a proper burial."
1 Kings,13,30,"And he put his body in his own grave; and they were really sad about it, like, 'Oh no, my bro!'"
1 Kings,13,31,"So, once he finished burying him, he had a chat with his kids and said, 'Listen up, when I kick the bucket, make sure to bury me in the same tomb where that holy dude was buried. Put my bones right next to his bones, alright?'"
1 Kings,13,32,"Like, the word of the LORD totally came true, man! He was all like, 'Yo, check it out! This altar in Bethel and all those fancy high places in the Samaria cities? They're gonna get some serious consequences, no doubt!'"
1 Kings,13,33,"After all that, Jeroboam didn't change his evil ways. Instead, he started appointing random dudes from the common folk as priests in the fancy spots. Basically, anyone who wanted the gig got it, and they became priests in those fancy spots."
1 Kings,13,34,"And this action became a sin for the fam of Jeroboam, so much so that it had to be eliminated and wiped out completely."
1 Kings,14,1,"This one time, Abijah, son of Jeroboam, got really sick."
1 Kings,14,2,"And Jeroboam was like, yo wifey, you gotta rock a sick disguise so nobody knows you're Mrs. Jeroboam. Go to Shiloh, 'cause that's where Ahijah the prophet is at. He's the one who said I was gonna be king over this crew."
1 Kings,14,3,"Grab ten loaves, some yummy cracknels, and a bottle of honey. Go to him and he'll spill the tea on what's gonna happen to the kid."
1 Kings,14,4,"So Jeroboam's wife followed the plan and got up to go to Shiloh, where she went to Ahijah's house. But Ahijah couldn't see because his eyesight had weakened with age."
1 Kings,14,5,"Yo, the LORD told Ahijah, listen up, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to ask you something for her son 'cause he's sick. This is what you gotta say to her: when she comes in, she should pretend to be someone else."
1 Kings,14,6,"So, like, Ahijah hears her footsteps at the door and he's all like, 'Come on in, you're Jeroboam's wife, why you pretending to be someone else?' 'Cause I got some serious stuff to tell ya, it's not gonna be easy to hear."
1 Kings,14,7,"Yo, go and spread the word to Jeroboam. This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, is saying: 'Yo, I totally lifted you up from the crowd and appointed you as the ruler over my peeps, Israel.'"
1 Kings,14,8,"And took the kingdom from David's family and gave it to you. But you haven't been like my dude David, who totally obeyed me and gave me his full loyalty, only doing what I thought was right."
1 Kings,14,9,"But you seriously messed up more than anyone before you: you went ahead and created your own gods, and even made statues of them, just to get on my nerves and totally disrespected me."
1 Kings,14,10,"Yo, check it out - I'm about to bring some serious trouble to Jeroboam's crib. I'm gonna wipe out anyone who thinks they're the king and also those left in Israel. I'll straight up remove any trace of Jeroboam's family, like how a person gets rid of stinky junk until it's all gone."
1 Kings,14,11,"Whoever dies from Jeroboam in the city, the dogs will eat them; and whoever dies in the field, the birds of the air will eat them. Because the LORD said so."
1 Kings,14,12,"So, like, go back to your house. And once you step foot into the city, the kid's gonna kick the bucket."
1 Kings,14,13,"And all of Israel will be sad and lay him to rest, because he was the only one from Jeroboam's house who will be given a proper burial. He was the only one who showed some goodness towards the LORD, the God of Israel."
1 Kings,14,14,"Yo, the LORD gonna bring up a new king for Israel, who gonna take down Jeroboam's whole fam in a single day. Like, seriously, it's about to go down."
1 Kings,14,15,"Like, the LORD is gonna totally teach Israel a lesson, you know? It'll be like shaking a reed in the water, but bigger. He's gonna uproot Israel from this awesome land their ancestors got, and scatter them beyond the river. Why? 'Cause they've been all about those groves and it's totally getting on the LORD's nerves."
1 Kings,14,16,"And God's gonna let Israel go down the drain because of all the messed up stuff Jeroboam did, dragging the rest of Israel into sin too."
1 Kings,14,17,"Then Jeroboam's wife got up, left, and went to Tirzah. And when she reached the doorway, the child passed away."
1 Kings,14,18,"They laid him to rest and all of Israel grieved for him, just as the LORD had foretold through his servant Ahijah the prophet."
1 Kings,14,19,"So, like, there's more stuff about what Jeroboam did, you know? Like how he was all about that war and ruling. You can find all the deets in the book that's all about the history of the kings of Israel."
1 Kings,14,20,"Jeroboam was in charge for like 22 years, and then he like died and his son Nadab took over."
1 Kings,14,21,"So, Rehoboam, Solomon's son, became the ruler of Judah. He was like forty-one years old when he started ruling and was in charge for like seventeen years in Jerusalem, the chosen city by the LORD from all the Israel tribes to give it His name. By the way, his mom's name was Naamah, an Ammonitess."
1 Kings,14,22,"So, Judah totally messed up in God's eyes, and they made Him super jealous with all the sinful stuff they did. It was way worse than anything their ancestors ever did. 😬"
1 Kings,14,23,"Dude, they totally set up these epic, elevated spots for worship with all these fancy statues and groves, like, everywhere! They had them on every freakin' hill and even chillin' under every lush tree."
1 Kings,14,24,"So like, you know, there were these people in the land who were into some messed up stuff, doing all the disgusting things that the other nations were doing, and just a reminder, God kicked them out of the land before His peeps, the children of Israel, moved in."
1 Kings,14,25,"So, like, in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, this dude Shishak, who was like the king of Egypt, straight up showed up at Jerusalem:"
1 Kings,14,26,"So, like, this dude straight up just swiped all the cool stuff from the house of the LORD and the king's crib. I'm talking about all the treasure, man. And he didn't stop there, he even jacked all of Solomon's sick gold shields. Like, seriously? Talk about a major heist."
1 Kings,14,27,"So king Rehoboam replaced the shields with cool bronze ones and gave them to the head of the guard, who was in charge of protecting the entrance to the king's crib. #keepingitsecure"
1 Kings,14,28,"So, like, when the king entered the crib of the LORD, the squad carried them and brought them back to the cool guard room."
1 Kings,14,29,"Yo, there's more to Rehoboam's story, and everything he did can be found in the book of the kings of Judah. Real talk."
1 Kings,14,30,"So, Rehoboam and Jeroboam were constantly beefing with each other."
1 Kings,14,31,"Rehoboam passed away and was laid to rest alongside his ancestors in the city of David. His mom, Naamah, was an Ammonite. Abijam, his son, took over as king after him. (Abijam was also known as Abijah, according to the Greek translation.)"
1 Kings,15,1,"So, like, in the eighteenth year that king Jeroboam, Nebat's son, was ruling, this dude Abijam became the king of Judah."
1 Kings,15,2,"He was king of Jerusalem for three years. His mom's name was Maachah, she was Abishalom's daughter. Maachah was also known as Michaiah, daughter of Uriel. Abishalom was also called Absalom."
1 Kings,15,3,"And he, like, totally followed in his father's footsteps, doing all the same wrong stuff, ya know? And his heart wasn't, like, fully committed to the LORD his God, you know, like how David his father's heart was."
1 Kings,15,4,"But yo, for real, the LORD his God gave David a lit lamp in Jerusalem, to make sure his son could take over and keep Jerusalem steady. (lamp can also mean candle, just fyi)"
1 Kings,15,5,"Yo, David was totally on point in the eyes of the LORD. He never went off track from anything the big guy commanded him to do throughout his life, except for that whole situation with Uriah the Hittite."
1 Kings,15,6,So Rehoboam and Jeroboam were constantly beefing throughout their whole lives.
1 Kings,15,7,"Hey, do you want to know more about Abijam? Well, for all the juicy deets and everything he did, you gotta check out the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah. Oh, and just so you know, there was some serious war going on between Abijam and Jeroboam."
1 Kings,15,8,"And Abijam passed away; they laid him to rest in the city of David, and his son Asa took over as ruler."
1 Kings,15,9,"So like, in the twelfth grade year of Jeroboam being the king of Israel, Asa became the ruler of Judah."
1 Kings,15,10,"So this dude ruled in Jerusalem for a solid 41 years. And his mom, Maachah, was the daughter of Abishalom. Just a little FYI, when I say mom, I mean grandma."
1 Kings,15,11,"And Asa was totally on point in the eyes of the LORD, just like his dad David."
1 Kings,15,12,So he got rid of all the people into some messed up stuff and destroyed all the cheesy statues that his ancestors had created.
1 Kings,15,13,"And even his mom, Maachah, he totally dethroned her 'cause she went and made a super lame idol in the grove. Asa straight up destroyed that idol and burned it by the brook Kidron."
1 Kings,15,14,"But like, those high places were still there, you know? But hey, Asa was totally keeping it real with the LORD every single day, no cap."
1 Kings,15,15,"So, he brought all the stuff his dad had dedicated, and the stuff he himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD. The goodies included silver, gold, and fancy items. {things: Hebrew for holy}"
1 Kings,15,16,"So, Asa and Baasha, the kings of Israel, were at constant odds and engaged in warfare throughout their reigns."
1 Kings,15,17,"So Baasha, the king of Israel, decided to go against Judah and built a stronghold in Ramah to block any incoming or outgoing traffic to King Asa of Judah."
1 Kings,15,18,"So Asa gathered up all the leftover cash and bling from the Lord's crib and his own crib, and gave it to his homies. Then King Asa sent his homies to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, who was the boss of Syria living in Damascus, and he said,"
1 Kings,15,19,"Yo, we cool, right? My pops and your pops, they tight too. Check it, I'm sending you some sick bling, silver and gold. Come through, let's cancel that deal you got with Baasha, the king of Israel, so he backs off. Word."
1 Kings,15,20,"So Benhadad listened to king Asa and sent his army captains to attack the cities of Israel. They successfully struck Ijon, Dan, Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, along with the entire land of Naphtali."
1 Kings,15,21,"And when Baasha found out, he stopped building Ramah and moved to Tirzah."
1 Kings,15,22,"So, like, King Asa got everyone in Judah to listen up, no one was left out, and they took those stones from Ramah and the wood that Baasha used to build, and King Asa used them to build Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah. Cool, right? No one was left out, you know?"
1 Kings,15,23,"Yo, there's still a bunch of cool stuff that Asa did, like his sick moves, and all the things he pulled off, not to mention the awesome cities he built. You can find all the deets in the book of records about the kings of Judah. But, like, when he got old, his feet got all messed up and he was dealing with some health issues."
1 Kings,15,24,"And Asa passed away and was buried in the same city as his ancestors, David his father. Afterward, his son Jehoshaphat became the new ruler. {Jehoshaphat: AKA Josaphat in Greek}"
1 Kings,15,25,"So, Nadab, Jeroboam's son, took over as the ruler of Israel in the second year of Asa's reign over Judah. He ruled Israel for a total of two years."
1 Kings,15,26,"And he totally messed up in God's eyes, like, he followed his father's lead and indulged in the same sinful behavior that caused all of Israel to go astray."
1 Kings,15,27,"So, there's this guy named Baasha, son of Ahijah from the Issachar fam, and he straight up plotted against another guy. Baasha went ahead and totally wrecked him at Gibbethon, which was like Philistine territory or whatever. You see, Nadab and all of Israel were just chilling, laying siege and everything, to Gibbethon."
1 Kings,15,28,"During Asa's third year as king of Judah, Baasha came and straight up took him out, becoming the new ruler."
1 Kings,15,29,"And like, when he was in charge, he totally wiped out the whole fam of Jeroboam. Like, he made sure no one was left, until he completely took him down, just like how the LORD said through his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:"
1 Kings,15,30,"Because Jeroboam did a bunch of messed up stuff that made both himself and Israel trip up, and as a result, he totally ticked off the LORD God of Israel, sending Him into rage mode."
1 Kings,15,31,"So, like, all the other stuff Nadab did, you can find it written in the book of the kings of Israel, ya know?"
1 Kings,15,32,"So Asa and Baasha, the kings of Israel, were at war with each other throughout their reigns."
1 Kings,15,33,"In Asa's third year as king of Judah, Baasha, Ahijah's son, took over as ruler of all Israel in Tirzah, and he ruled for twenty-four years."
1 Kings,15,34,"And he was not good in God's eyes, and followed the path of Jeroboam, and committed the same wrongdoing that led Israel astray."
1 Kings,16,1,"So, like, God was all like, 'Yo, Jehu, check it. I got a message for you about Baasha, bro."
1 Kings,16,2,"Dude, I totally lifted you up from the bottom and made you the big boss over my peeps in Israel. But like, you went and followed in Jeroboam's footsteps and got my people all messed up, making them sin and ticking me off with all their wickedness."
1 Kings,16,3,"Yo, listen up! I'm gonna totally wipe out Baasha's descendants and the whole line of his family. Then I'll make your crib just like Jeroboam, Nebat's son, no cap."
1 Kings,16,4,"Those who die in the city of Baasha will be eaten by dogs, and those who die in the fields will be eaten by birds of the air."
1 Kings,16,5,"Yo, you wanna know more about Baasha and all the stuff he pulled off? Check out the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel, fam. It's got all the deets on his acts, his epic moves, and his straight-up power."
1 Kings,16,6,"And Baasha passed away, joining his ancestors, and was laid to rest in Tirzah. Then his son Elah became king in his place."
1 Kings,16,7,"And like, the prophet Jehu, Hanani's son, totally received a message from the LORD about Baasha and his fam. And let me tell you, Baasha had done some seriously messed up stuff in the eyes of the LORD. He was all up in God's face, with the things he was doing and the way he was acting, just like Jeroboam's crew. Oh, and by the way, Baasha straight up killed Jeroboam too."
1 Kings,16,8,"In like, the 26th year of Asa, the king of Judah, Elah, dude, the son of Baasha, took over as ruler of Israel in Tirzah, and he, like ruled for two years, man."
1 Kings,16,9,"And then Zimri, the cool dude in charge of half his sick chariots, totally plotted against him while he was chilling in Tirzah, getting wasted in the crib of Arza, the manager of his house in Tirzah. #sneaky"
1 Kings,16,10,"So Zimri went in and, like, totally attacked him and ended up killing him, in the twenty-seventh year of Asa ruling over Judah, and he became the new ruler and everything."
1 Kings,16,11,"So, like, once this guy became king and sat on his throne, he totally wiped out the entire household of Baasha. Seriously, not a single person was spared, not even his relatives or friends. Like, it was a complete annihilation, bro."
1 Kings,16,12,"So Zimri totally wiped out Baasha's whole crib, just like the message from the Big Man himself, spoken through Jehu the prophet. (FYI, Jehu was like the messenger boy for the LORD)."
1 Kings,16,13,"Like, Baasha and his son Elah were totally caught up in their sinful ways, and they got Israel hooked too! They seriously ticked off the LORD God of Israel with all their pointless and empty actions."
1 Kings,16,14,"Yo, like, if you wanna know more dope stuff Elah did, check out the book of the kings of Israel. It's got all the juicy deets and everything!"
1 Kings,16,15,"So, like, in the 27th year of Asa being king of Judah, this dude Zimri became king for, like, a whole week in this place called Tirzah. And the people were all like camping out near this place called Gibbethon, which was, like, owned by the Philistines or whatever."
1 Kings,16,16,"So, like, the peeps who were camping, they heard this tea that Zimri was plotting and he straight up killed the king. So, all of Israel decided to make Omri, the boss of the squad, the king of Israel right then and there in the camp."
1 Kings,16,17,"So, Omri and all the cool peeps in Israel rolled out of Gibbethon and decided to lay down some serious siege action on Tirzah."
1 Kings,16,18,"So, like, Zimri peeped that the city got taken, and he was like, 'nah, not today,' and straight up headed to the king's crib, and straight up set fire to the king's house and himself, and that's how he met his end."
1 Kings,16,19,"Because he messed up and did a lot of bad stuff that went against what God wanted, following in the messed-up footsteps of Jeroboam. And he didn't stop there, he went ahead and made all of Israel mess up too."
1 Kings,16,20,"Yo, there's more juicy deets about Zimri and all the sketchy stuff he pulled. You can find all the tea in the book that's filled with stories about the kings of Israel, ya know what I'm sayin'?"
1 Kings,16,21,"So, like, Israel was totally split into two groups: one side was all about Tibni, Ginath's son, and, like, they wanted to make him king. But the other side was all about Omri, you know? And they were like, 'Omri for the win!'"
1 Kings,16,22,"But the squad that rolled with Omri totally crushed Tibni's crew, son of Ginath. So Tibni croaked and Omri took over the throne."
1 Kings,16,23,"In the thirty-first year of Asa being king of Judah, Omri came to power as the ruler of Israel. He reigned for twelve years, with six of those years spent ruling from Tirzah."
1 Kings,16,24,"So he copped the Samaria hill from Shemer for two silver talents, then he straight up built a city on that hill and named it Samaria, after Shemer who owned the hill. {Samaria: Hebrew for Shomeron}"
1 Kings,16,25,"But Omri was seriously problematic in the eyes of the LORD, and he did even worse stuff than anyone who came before him."
1 Kings,16,26,"Because he totally followed the footsteps of Jeroboam, Nebat's son, and committed the same sinful acts that led all of Israel astray. This obviously made the Almighty God of Israel pretty mad, thanks to their obsession with worthless stuff."
1 Kings,16,27,"Yo, you wanna know about all the other cool things Omri did and how strong he was? Check out the book of Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, it's all written there, no cap!"
1 Kings,16,28,"And then Omri passed away and was buried in Samaria. So Ahab, his son, took over as the ruler."
1 Kings,16,29,"So, like, in the 38th year when Asa was ruling Judah, this dude Ahab, who's Omri's son, took over as the king of Israel. And get this, Ahab ruled over Israel in Samaria for a solid 22 years, man!"
1 Kings,16,30,"Ahab, the son of Omri, straight up messed up big time in the eyes of the LORD, like worse than anyone before him."
1 Kings,16,31,"And it happened, like it was no big deal to him, he started following the sinful ways of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat. He even married Jezebel, the daughter of Ethbaal, who was the king of the Zidonians. He went on to worship Baal, dedicating his life to serving him."
1 Kings,16,32,"And he built a sick altar for Baal in the totally lit house of Baal, which he flexed in Samaria."
1 Kings,16,33,"So, like, Ahab goes and sets up this grove thing, and honestly, he totally takes it to the next level by pissing off the LORD God of Israel way more than any other king before him. Like, the dude really knows how to push buttons, you know?"
1 Kings,16,34,"Back in the day, this guy named Hiel from Bethel went and built Jericho. He laid down the foundations using his firstborn son, Abiram, and set up the gates with his youngest son, Segub. Why, you ask? Well, it was all because of a word from the LORD that was spoken through Joshua, the son of Nun."
1 Kings,17,1,"Yo, Elijah from Gilead, the Tishbite, straight up told Ahab, the king, as long as the LORD God of Israel is legit, and I'm here representing Him, there ain't gonna be any dew or rain for a few years, and that's on me."
1 Kings,17,2,"Yo, the LORD dropped a message for him, like,"
1 Kings,17,3,"Yo, like, go away from here and head east, then find a chill spot by the brook Cherith, you know, the one in front of Jordan river."
1 Kings,17,4,"Yo, listen up! Get this, fam: You gonna sip from that stream, and guess what? I've straight up told those ravens to hook you up with snacks, right there."
1 Kings,17,5,"So he did what God said and went to live by this cool stream called Cherith, right before the Jordan River. It was lit."
1 Kings,17,6,"And those ravens, like, totally hooked him up with bread and meat in the morning and evening, and he quenched his thirst from the brook."
1 Kings,17,7,"So, after some time, the brook totally dried up because there was no rain at all in the whole land. #DrySeasonAlert 😬"
1 Kings,17,8,"God slid into his DMs, saying,"
1 Kings,17,9,"Yo, get up and head to Zarephath, you know, that place near Zidon. Settle down there because I've specifically told a widow in that area to take care of you. Trust me, it's gonna be all good!"
1 Kings,17,10,"So he got up and went to Zarephath. And when he arrived at the entrance of the city, he saw a widow woman gathering sticks there. He called out to her and said, 'Yo, can you get me a little water in a cup so I can quench my thirst?'"
1 Kings,17,11,"As she was heading over to get it, he called out to her and said, 'Hey, can you please bring me a piece of bread?'"
1 Kings,17,12,"And she was like, 'OMG, I swear on God's name, I don't have a cake or anything fancy, just a tiny bit of meal in a container and a little oil in a bottle. Like, I'm literally out here picking up two sticks so I can make a fire and cook it for me and my son, so that we can eat it and survive.'"
1 Kings,17,13,"So Elijah was like, 'Chill, don't be scared. Go ahead and do what you said, but whip up a small cake for me first, then bring it to me. After that, go ahead and make some for yourself and your son.'"
1 Kings,17,14,"Listen up, fam! The big man upstairs, AKA the LORD God of Israel, has got your back. He's saying that your meal stash won't run out and your oil supply won't dry up until He blesses us with rain. No cap! 💯"
1 Kings,17,15,So she went and did what Elijah said: and both she and Elijah and everyone in her house had food for a long time. They feasted for days on end. It was a bountiful year of feasting.
1 Kings,17,16,"And the supply of food never ran out, and the oil bottle never went empty, just like the LORD had said through Elijah."
1 Kings,17,17,"So like, after all this stuff went down, the son of the woman who owned the place got really sick. And I mean, he was sick to the point where he couldn't even breathe anymore. It was intense."
1 Kings,17,18,"And she was like, OMG Elijah, why you gotta bring up my past and make me feel guilty? Are you here just to remind me of my mistakes and make my son suffer?"
1 Kings,17,19,"And he was like, 'Yo, hand me your son.' So he grabbed the kid from her and took him up to this chill loft where he stayed, and gently put him on his own bed."
1 Kings,17,20,"So, like, he prayed to the LORD and was like, 'Yo, LORD my God, did you, like, totally make bad stuff happen to the widow I've been hanging out with by making her son die?'"
1 Kings,17,21,"So, like, he laid down on the kid three times and was like, yelling to God, and saying, 'Hey, God, please, like, bring this kid's soul back to him.' {stretched: means measured or, like, extended} {into...: means into his inward parts or, like, deep inside him}"
1 Kings,17,22,"And OMG, God totally heard Elijah callin' out, and the kid's soul was like back in him, and he came alive again. It was lit!"
1 Kings,17,23,"And Elijah took the kid, and brought him down from the room into the crib, and gave him back to his mom: and Elijah was like, yo, check it out, your son is alive."
1 Kings,17,24,"And the woman was like, OMG Elijah, I totally believe you're a legit man of God. The stuff you say, straight from the Lord's mouth, it's all facts. No cap."
1 Kings,18,1,"After a while, the LORD spoke to Elijah, after three years, and said, 'Yo, go find Ahab and I'll make it rain on the earth.'"
1 Kings,18,2,"So Elijah went to meet up with Ahab. And dude, there was a serious famine going on in Samaria."
1 Kings,18,3,"So Ahab reached out to Obadiah, who was in charge of his house. (By the way, Obadiah was totally devoted to the LORD; his Hebrew name is Obadiahu.) Also, just to clarify, Obadiah was the boss of Ahab's crib."
1 Kings,18,4,"Back in the day, when Jezebel straight up wiped out all the LORD's prophets, Obadiah came in clutch. He saved a hundred prophets and hid them in groups of fifty in a secret cave, making sure they were fed with bread and water. (BTW, Jezebel's real name in Hebrew is Izebel, just an FYI)"
1 Kings,18,5,"Ahab was like, 'Yo Obadiah, go check out all the water sources and streams in the land. Maybe we can find some grass to keep our horses and mules alive, so we don't end up losing all our animals. You know, we don't wanna cut ourselves off from them, man.'"
1 Kings,18,6,"So they split up the land between them and decided to explore it separately: Ahab went his own way, and Obadiah took a different path for himself."
1 Kings,18,7,"While Obadiah was on his way, he suddenly ran into Elijah and recognized him. Overwhelmed with awe, he bowed down and said, 'Dude, are you the one and only Elijah?'"
1 Kings,18,8,"And he was like, yo, tell your boss, like, guess who's here? Elijah, bro."
1 Kings,18,9,"And he's like, yo, what did I do wrong that made you wanna give me to Ahab to kill me?"
1 Kings,18,10,"I swear on everything, God is out here sending people from all over to find you. They be saying you ain't around, but my guy made sure to make a big deal out of it and made everyone swear that they couldn't find you in any nation or kingdom."
1 Kings,18,11,"And now you're like, 'Dude, go tell your boss, guess what? Elijah's in the house!'"
1 Kings,18,12,"Like, once I bounce, the Spirit of the LORD will take you somewhere, I don't even know where. Then, when I go and tell Ahab, and he can't find you, he'll totally kill me. But, like, I've been fearing the LORD since I was young, you know?"
1 Kings,18,13,"Yo, didn't I tell you, my dude, how I held it down when Jezebel took out all them prophets? I straight up hid a hundred of the LORD's prophets, splitting 'em fifty-fifty, in a cave and hooked them up with bread and water."
1 Kings,18,14,"And now you're like, 'Go tell your boss, Elijah's here and he's gonna kill me.'"
1 Kings,18,15,"And Elijah was like, I swear on God's name who has ultimate power, and I'm standing here in front of Him, that I'm definitely going to reveal myself to that guy today."
1 Kings,18,16,"So Obadiah was like, 'Yo, Ahab, listen up!' And Ahab was like, 'What's good?' And then Ahab rolled up to meet Elijah."
1 Kings,18,17,"So, like, when Ahab spotted Elijah, he was all like, 'Yo, dude! Are you the one causing all this chaos in Israel?'"
1 Kings,18,18,"And he was like, 'Dude, it's not my fault that things are messed up in Israel. It's totally you and your fam's fault for ditching God's commandments and going after Baalim."
1 Kings,18,19,"So like, go ahead and gather all of Israel, ya know, to mount Carmel and bring the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of the groves, who totally have their fancy meals with Jezebel and all."
1 Kings,18,20,So Ahab hit up all the Israelite homies and invited the prophets to roll through to Mount Carmel.
1 Kings,18,21,"So, Elijah pulled up to the crowd and was like, 'Yo, how long you gonna be indecisive? If the LORD is the real deal, then show some loyalty. But if you're all about Baal, then go ahead and follow him.' And you know what? The people didn't even say a word. Silence, bro."
1 Kings,18,22,"So Elijah was like, 'Yo, listen up everyone! I'm, like, the only prophet left who reps the LORD. But those dudes who worship Baal? They got, like, four hundred and fifty prophets.'"
1 Kings,18,23,"Yo, tell them to bring us two bullocks. And then they can choose one for themselves, cut it up and put it on the wood, but don't light it up or anything. I'll take care of the other bullock, put it on the wood, and no need to ignite it either."
1 Kings,18,24,"Yo, go ahead and holla at your gods, and I'll be calling on the name of the LORD. We'll see which God responds with fire and that's the real deal. And all the peeps said, 'That's a solid plan, fam.'"
1 Kings,18,25,"So Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, 'Alright, listen up, guys. Pick a bull for yourselves and get it ready. Since there are a lot of you, go ahead and call on your gods, but don't light any fire.'"
1 Kings,18,26,"So, they grabbed the bullock they were given, got it all ready, and began calling out to Baal like crazy from morning to noon, like 'Yo, Baal, listen up!' But guess what? Baal didn't say a word, didn't even text back. They even started jumping around on the altar they made in desperation."
1 Kings,18,27,"And in the middle of the day, Elijah started to tease them, saying, 'Shout louder! Maybe your god is on the phone, or on a road trip, or taking a nap and needs to be woken up.'"
1 Kings,18,28,"They were screaming and started cutting themselves with knives and sharp objects, causing their blood to gush out. (The blood was literally pouring out of them.)"
1 Kings,18,29,"So, like, it happened when it was already past noon and they kept on prophesying until the time when they were about to offer the evening sacrifice. But, dude, there was no voice, no one to answer, no one to pay attention. It was like crickets, man."
1 Kings,18,30,"And Elijah was like, 'Yo, all y'all come over here.' So the people gathered around him. And he totally fixed up the altar of the LORD that was all messed up."
1 Kings,18,31,"So Elijah grabbed twelve stones, like for each of the tribes of Jacob's offspring, because God had told him that Israel was gonna be their name, you know?"
1 Kings,18,32,"So, he used the stones to flex and build an epic altar in the name of the LORD. And to level up the altar game, he dug a huge trench around it, big enough to hold two whole measures of seed."
1 Kings,18,33,"Then he arranged the wood, diced the bullock, and placed it on the wood. He commanded, 'Get four barrels and totally drench the burnt sacrifice and the wood with water.'"
1 Kings,18,34,"And he was like, 'Yo, do it again. And they were like, 'Bet, let's do it again.' And he was like, 'Okay, one more time.' And they were like, 'Sure, let's do it one last time.'"
1 Kings,18,35,"And the water totally surrounded the altar, and he even filled the trench with water. {went: means water was flowing}"
1 Kings,18,36,"So, like, when it was time for the evening sacrifice, Elijah the prophet came up and was like, 'Yo, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let everyone know today that you're the real deal in Israel and that I'm your servant and I've totally done all this stuff because you told me to.'"
1 Kings,18,37,"Listen up, LORD, listen up, so that these peeps can know that you're the one and only LORD God and that you've totally helped them get their hearts back on track."
1 Kings,18,38,"And then, like, a massive fire from the LORD came down and totally burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones, the dust, and even drank up all the water that was in the trench. It was insane!"
1 Kings,18,39,"And when everyone saw what happened, they were completely shook and dropped to the floor. They were like, 'OMG, the LORD is the boss, like the ultimate God, no doubt about it. The LORD, like, totally rules!"
1 Kings,18,40,"And Elijah was like, yo, grab all those prophets of Baal, don't let any of them get away. So they caught them and Elijah took them to the brook Kishon and straight up took them out there."
1 Kings,18,41,"Yo, Ahab, get up and grab some food and drinks! I'm telling you, there's about to be a crazy rainstorm coming in. Like, you can already hear the sound of it, man!"
1 Kings,18,42,"So Ahab was like, 'Yo, I'm gonna go eat and drink.' And Elijah was all like, 'I'm heading up to the top of Carmel,' and he straight up flung himself down on the ground, with his face buried between his knees."
1 Kings,18,43,"Then he told his servant, 'Yo, head up and peep at the sea.' So his servant went up, checked it out, and was like, 'Nah, nothing there.' But the boss was like, 'Nah, try again, bro. Seven times.'"
1 Kings,18,44,"So, like, after trying seven times, this dude was like, 'Yo, check it out, there's, like, this small cloud rising from the sea, like it's the size of a dude's hand.' And he was like, 'Go tell Ahab, get your ride ready and head down before you get caught in the rain.'"
1 Kings,18,45,"So, like, it happened in the meantime, the sky got all dark with clouds and wind, and it started pouring like crazy. And Ahab, he hopped on his ride and headed to Jezreel."
1 Kings,18,46,"The LORD empowered Elijah, and he got ready and sprinted ahead of Ahab all the way to the entrance of Jezreel. {to the...: Means until he reached Jezreel}"
1 Kings,19,1,"So, like, Ahab spills the tea to Jezebel about everything Elijah pulled off, ya know? He's all like, 'Yo, Elijah totally wrecked those prophets, straight up slayed 'em with a sword.'"
1 Kings,19,2,"So Jezebel hit up Elijah with a message, like, swear to the gods, if I don't make your life as cursed as theirs by this time tomorrow!"
1 Kings,19,3,"And when he saw that, he was like, OMG! He quickly got up, ran for his life, and arrived at Beersheba, which is in Judah. He left his loyal servant there."
1 Kings,19,4,"But he totally dipped into the wilderness for, like, a whole day and found a chill spot under a juniper tree. He straight up asked to peace out and be done with life, saying 'I'm over it, God, can you just end me now? I ain't no better than my ancestors, tbh. Like, seriously, for real."
1 Kings,19,5,"And while he was chilling and taking a nap under a cool tree, suddenly an angel came and gently tapped him, saying, 'Yo, wake up and grab a snack.'"
1 Kings,19,6,"So he checked it out, and like, there was this epic cake cooking on the coals, and a container of water right next to his swag. And he totally chowed down and drank, then crashed out again. #Blessed"
1 Kings,19,7,"Then the LORD's angel came back again, giving him a friendly tap and saying, 'Dude, get up and grub! This journey is way too intense for you to handle on an empty stomach.'"
1 Kings,19,8,"Then he got up, had some grub and a drink, and journeyed for a solid forty days and nights to Horeb, the lit mount of God."
1 Kings,19,9,"So, Elijah went to this cave and decided to spend the night there. And, surprise surprise, God spoke to him and asked, 'Why are you here, Elijah? What's up?'}"
1 Kings,19,10,"Yo, listen up, fam. I gotta keep it real with y'all. I've been mad protective of the big man upstairs, the LORD God of hosts. The Israelites straight up betrayed the promise they made with Him, breaking altars and straight-up murdering prophets. I'm telling you, I'm the last one holdin' it down for God, and now these peeps are after me, trying to end my life."
1 Kings,19,11,"Then God was like, 'Yo, go out and chill on that big mountain in front of Me.' And guess what? God showed up, but not in the wind that straight up tore apart those mountains and rocks. And there was also an earthquake, but God wasn't in that either:"
1 Kings,19,12,"And like, right after the earthquake, there was this fire, ya know? But, like, the LORD wasn't in the fire or anything. And then, after the fire, there was, like, this super calm and soft voice, dude."
1 Kings,19,13,"So like, when Elijah heard that, he was totally shook. He quickly covered his face with his cloak and stepped outside, standing at the entrance of the cave. And yo, out of nowhere, a voice came to him asking, 'Dude, what's up? What are you doing here, Elijah?'"
1 Kings,19,14,"So, like, I totally told him, 'Listen up, I've been super loyal and protective of the LORD God of hosts, because the Israelites straight up ditched your covenant, destroyed your altars, and killed your prophets with swords. And guess what? I'm the only one left and they're out here trying to take my life.'"
1 Kings,19,15,"And God was like, 'Yo, dude. Head back to the wilderness of Damascus and once you get there, go ahead and anoint Hazael as the king of Syria.'"
1 Kings,19,16,"You gotta anoint Jehu, Nimshi's kid, as the king of Israel. And Elisha, Shaphat's son from Abelmeholah, you gotta anoint as the prophet to take your place. (Elisha is also known as Eliseus in Greek)."
1 Kings,19,17,"And like, yo, the ones who manage to dodge Hazael's sword, Jehu's gonna take them down. And like, the peeps who escape from Jehu's sword, Elisha's gonna slay them. No joke!"
1 Kings,19,18,"But I still have seven thousand fellow Gen Zers in Israel who haven't given in to the Baal trend, the ones who haven't jumped on that bandwagon and kissed it. #keepingitreal #staytrue"
1 Kings,19,19,"So he went away from there and came across Elisha, son of Shaphat, who was out there plowing with a whole bunch of oxen, like twelve yokes of them. Elisha himself was working on the last one, and then Elijah just walked up to him and threw his cool cloak thingy on him."
1 Kings,19,20,"And he ditched the oxen and sprinted after Elijah, and was like, 'Yo, let me just peck my mom and dad, and then I'm down to roll with you.' And Elijah was like, 'Yo, go back. What's my deal to you? #Clueless'}"
1 Kings,19,21,"And he bounced back from that, grabbed some farming equipment and killed a couple of oxen, cooked their meat with those same tools, and served it to the crowd. Then he got up, followed Elijah, and started serving him."
1 Kings,20,1,"So this dude Benhadad, the king of Syria, he got all his homies together. There were like 32 kings with him, plus a bunch of horses and chariots. Then they straight up rolled up to Samaria and started a full-on siege and war."
1 Kings,20,2,"So he DM'd some messengers to Ahab, the king of Israel, slid into his city, and hit him up with this, he's like,"
1 Kings,20,3,"I totally own your cash, your bling, and even your squad and fam. Like, your bae goals and your squad goals are all mine, no cap."
1 Kings,20,4,"And the king of Israel was like, yo king, I'm all yours, just like you said, and everything I got too."
1 Kings,20,5,"And the messengers came again, and were like, yo, Benhadad is saying, even though I hit you up before, telling you to hand over your money, jewelry, and your whole fam;"
1 Kings,20,6,"But yo, tomorrow I'm sending my peeps to check out your crib and your servants' cribs too. And whatever looks fly to you, they'll snatch it up and take it. It's gonna be lit, trust."
1 Kings,20,7,"So the ruler of Israel gathered all the older people of the land and said, 'Listen up, guys, check this out: this dude is up to no good. He reached out to me asking for my spouses, my kids, and all my valuable stuff, and I didn't refuse him!'"
1 Kings,20,8,"And lke, all the boomers and all the squad were like, don't even listen to what he's saying, like, don't even agree with him, you know?"
1 Kings,20,9,"So he told the messengers of Benhadad, 'Let my dude the king know that I got you covered with everything you asked for the first time, but I just can't do this one thing.' And the messengers bounced, then came back with the message."
1 Kings,20,10,"So Benhadad DM'd him and said, I swear on the gods, and even more, if there's enough dust in Samaria for everyone who's simpin' after me. {follow...: in other words, they're all at my feet}"
1 Kings,20,11,"And the king of Israel was like, bruh, tell him not to flex his gear like he's already won the battle."
1 Kings,20,12,"So, like, when {Benhadad} heard this text, while he was chugging drinks with the kings in the chill pavilions, he was all like, 'Yo, squad, get ready for battle!' And they all geared up, ready to attack the city. {word: Hebrew term} {pavilions: or, tents} {Set yourselves in array: or, Arrange the artillery. And they arranged the artillery}."
1 Kings,20,13,"Yo, listen up! So there's this prophet who rolls up to Ahab, the king of Israel, and drops this sick message from the LORD: 'Hey, Ahab, you peeped that massive crowd over there? Well, check this out. I'm gonna hand 'em over to you today, just so you know I'm the almighty boss.'"
1 Kings,20,14,"Ahab was like, 'Who's gonna make this battle happen?' And the dude was like, 'Listen up, young fellas from all over are gonna lead the charge.' Ahab was like, 'Okay, but who's gonna call the shots?' And the response was, 'You, bro. You're in charge.'"
1 Kings,20,15,"So he like counted all the cool dudes from the important places, and there were like 232 of them. And then he counted all the peeps, like every single one of the Israelites, and there were 7,000 of them."
1 Kings,20,16,"So, like, it was noon and they all went out, right? And Benhadad was totally getting wasted in the pavilions, along with the thirty-two kings who were supporting him."
1 Kings,20,17,"So, like, the homies from the important places dipped out first; and Benhadad was like, 'yo, go check it out' and they came back saying, 'dude, there are guys coming from Samaria'."
1 Kings,20,18,"And he was like, if they're chill and want peace, then like, capture them; or if they're all ready for a fight, still capture them."
1 Kings,20,19,"So, like, these cool dudes from the cities, you know, they rolled out with their crew of fellow soldiers. 🕺🏼"
1 Kings,20,20,"So, like, each dude totally took out their opponent, and the Syrians straight up ran away, but Israel was all like, 'Nuh-uh, not letting you escape!' And Benhadad, the king of Syria, managed to ride away on a horse with his squad of horsemen."
1 Kings,20,21,"So the king of Israel went out and totally wrecked the horses and chariots, and straight up defeated the Syrians with a massive beatdown."
1 Kings,20,22,"So, like, the prophet went up to the king of Israel and was all like, 'Listen up, bro! You gotta get your act together and be on top of your game. Watch closely and figure out your next move, 'cause next year the king of Syria will totally be after you.'"
1 Kings,20,23,"So like, the servants of the king of Syria were like, 'Dude, their gods only work in the hills, that's why they defeated us. But if we fight them in the open plain, for sure we'll be stronger than them.'"
1 Kings,20,24,"Yo, listen up! It's time to make moves. Let's strip those kings of their power, kick 'em out of their thrones, and replace 'em with some badass captains!"
1 Kings,20,25,"Gather a squad, just as big as the squad you lost, with horses and chariots matching theirs. We're gonna go head-to-head on the battlefield, and trust me, we'll be stronger than them. And guess what? He agreed to their plan and made it happen."
1 Kings,20,26,"So, at the start of the year, Benhadad counted his squad, rounded up the Syrians, and headed to Aphek for a massive battle with Israel. Yeah, you heard it right, they were ready to throw down!"
1 Kings,20,27,"So, like, the children of Israel, they all gathered up and got ready to face the Syrians. It was like two small groups of cute little goats coming up against them. But man, the Syrians, they just totally took over the whole place, you know?"
1 Kings,20,28,"So this dude who's all close to God rolls up to the king of Israel and starts saying, 'Listen up, God's like, the boss everywhere. These Syrians are dissing Him by saying He's only in charge of the hills, not the valleys. But let me tell ya, I'm gonna hand this massive army over to you. And then you'll see that I'm the real deal, the LORD."
1 Kings,20,29,"They set up camp across from each other for a whole week. Then, on the seventh day, the battle began. The Israelites totally obliterated the Syrian army, taking down a whopping one hundred thousand soldiers in just one day."
1 Kings,20,30,"So the others dipped out of there and went to Aphek, like, into the city and a massive wall straight up fell on twenty-seven thousand dudes who were still left. And Benhadad ran off and slipped into the city, hiding in some hidden spot, probably like a boss hideout or something. (or, like going from one fancy room to another: Hebrew says, like a secret chamber within another secret chamber)"
1 Kings,20,31,"So, his peeps were like, yo listen up! We've heard that the kings from Israel are all about that compassion vibe. Let's hit 'em up, like please! We'll wear these humble threads, put ropes on our heads, and roll up to the king of Israel, hoping he might just save your soul."
1 Kings,20,32,"So they, like, put on these sackcloth outfits and tied ropes on their heads, and went up to the king of Israel and were all like, 'Yo, your boy Benhadad wants to live. Can you let him?'. And the king's like, 'Wait, he's still alive? He's, like, my bro!'."
1 Kings,20,33,"So these guys were basically watching and waiting to see if anything would happen, and when it did, they quickly grabbed onto it. They were like, 'Yo, that's your bro Benhadad!' Then the dude was like, 'Go get him!' And just like that, Benhadad came forward and hopped into the chariot."
1 Kings,20,34,"And Benhadad was like, yo dude, I'mma give back those cities my dad took from your dad. And you can have some sweet streets in Damascus, just like my dad made in Samaria. Then Ahab was all, bet, I'll send you off with this agreement. So they made a deal and Benhadad bounced. (Streets: aka market places)"
1 Kings,20,35,"So there was this dude, one of the prophets' crew, talking to his homie like, 'Yo, hit me up for real, fam. I'm down.' But his friend was like, 'Nah, bro. I ain't gonna hit you.'"
1 Kings,20,36,"And he was like, yo bro, since you didn't listen to the Lord's voice and all, check it, as soon as you leave my presence, a lion's gonna take you out. No joke, man, as soon as he bounced, a lion came across him and bam, he was done."
1 Kings,20,37,"Then he came across another dude and was like, 'Yo, hit me up, bro.' And the dude straight up smacked him, leaving him with some serious bruises. 🤕"
1 Kings,20,38,"So the prophet bounced, and chillaxed for the king on the road, and fronted with ashes on his face."
1 Kings,20,39,"And like, as the king was walking by, this dude shouted at him and was like, 'Yo, listen up king! So, I was out there in the heat of battle, right? And outta nowhere, some dude comes up to me and hands me another dude, saying I gotta keep him safe. He was like, 'If this dude goes missing, your life is gonna pay the price or you gotta cough up a whole talent of silver, bro. Like, seriously!"
1 Kings,20,40,"And when your boy was all over the place, he disappeared. Then the king of Israel was like, 'That's how it's gonna go down for you, my dude. You brought it upon yourself.' (FYI, dude totally vanished!)"
1 Kings,20,41,"In a hurry, he quickly wiped the ashes off his face, and the king of Israel realized that he was one of the prophets."
1 Kings,20,42,"Yo, listen up! God said to him, 'Check it, dude. You messed up big time by letting that guy escape who I totally wanted destroyed. So now, your life is gonna be payback for his life, and your people will suffer the consequences too.'"
1 Kings,20,43,"So the king of Israel went back home feeling bummed and annoyed, and he arrived in Samaria."
1 Kings,21,1,"So, like, there was this dude named Naboth, he was a Jezreelite and he had this sick vineyard in Jezreel, right next to the palace where Ahab, the king of Samaria, chilled."
1 Kings,21,2,"So, Ahab goes up to Naboth and is like, 'Yo, can you give me your vineyard? I want to turn it into an herb garden because it's right next to my crib. And I'll hook you up with an even better vineyard in exchange, or if you'd rather, I'll give you the cash value for it."
1 Kings,21,3,"And Naboth was like, 'Ahab, dude, I can't let that happen! It's totally against what God wants for me to just give away my family's property to you.'"
1 Kings,21,4,"So, Ahab went back to his crib all moody and upset because of what Naboth the Jezreelite said to him. Naboth straight up told him, 'No way am I giving you my family's inheritance.' Ahab was so pissed, he just threw himself on his bed, turned away, and refused to eat anything."
1 Kings,21,5,"Then Jezebel, his wife, came up to him and was like, 'Yo, why you lookin' all down? Not even eating any bread?'"
1 Kings,21,6,"So, like, I talked to this girl and I was all like, 'Hey, Naboth from Jezreel, give me your vineyard and I'll pay you for it. Or, if you prefer, I can give you another vineyard in exchange.' But then he was all like, 'No way, man! I'm not giving you my vineyard!'"
1 Kings,21,7,"Yo, Jezebel, his wifey, straight up said to him, 'You really gonna be in charge of Israel now? Come on, get up and have some grub, enjoy yourself. I'll hook you up with Naboth the Jezreelite's vineyard.'"
1 Kings,21,8,"So she slid into Ahab's DMs, using his custom emoji seal, and sent the messages to the OGs and influencers in his city, who were homies with Naboth."
1 Kings,21,9,"So she sent messages that said, 'Everyone, we're having a fast, and let's make Naboth the center of attention among the people. Like, he should be like, super popular and stuff.'"
1 Kings,21,10,"And get two dudes, total non-believers, to stand in front of him and talk trash about him, claiming he disrespected God and the ruler. And then, take him outside and throw rocks at him until he dies."
1 Kings,21,11,"So, like, the dudes from his town, ya know, the older guys and the fancy peeps who lived there, did what Jezebel told them to do. They followed everything that was written in the letters she sent them."
1 Kings,21,12,They called for a fast and put Naboth in a top position among the people.
1 Kings,21,13,"So, like, there were these two guys who were like total troublemakers, and they came and sat in front of this other guy. And these troublemaker guys started talking smack about this guy named Naboth, in front of everyone! They were saying how Naboth disrespected God and the king. And guess what they did next? They actually took Naboth out of the city and threw stones at him until he died. Like, it was brutal, man."
1 Kings,21,14,"So they texted Jezebel like, 'Naboth got wrecked and he's gone.'"
1 Kings,21,15,"So, like, Jezebel found out that Naboth got stoned and, you know, dropped dead. And then Jezebel goes to Ahab and is all like, 'Dude, get up and take over Naboth's vineyard in Jezreel! He totally wouldn't sell it to you even if you offered cash, but guess what? Naboth ain't around anymore, he's dead!'"
1 Kings,21,16,"So like, Ahab found out that Naboth was dead, and he was like, 'Yo, I'm gonna head to Naboth's vineyard in Jezreel and take it for myself.'"
1 Kings,21,17,"So, like, God reached out to Elijah the Tishbite, right? And here's what He said,"
1 Kings,21,18,"Hey, get up and head over to meet Ahab, the king of Israel. He's chilling in Samaria, specifically at Naboth's vineyard, where he's planning to take it over."
1 Kings,21,19,"And you need to talk to him, like, listen up, the LORD says, did you really have to go and kill someone just to take their stuff? And I'm telling you, the LORD says, just like how those dogs licked up Naboth's blood in that place, they're gonna lick up your blood too, yes, yours."
1 Kings,21,20,"Ahab was like, 'Yo, Elijah, you found me, you sneaky enemy!' And Elijah was like, 'Yeah, I found you, bro. You sold yourself out, doing evil stuff that's not cool in the eyes of the LORD.'"
1 Kings,21,21,"Yo, listen up. Imma make some bad stuff happen to you, like seriously not cool. Your fam? Yeah, they're gone. And I'm gonna wipe out all dudes in Ahab's gang, whether they pee standing or are left behind in Israel. It's gonna be rough, man."
1 Kings,21,22,"And your crib will be like Jeroboam's crib and Baasha's crib, 'cause you totally ticked me off and got Israel to sin."
1 Kings,21,23,"The LORD also said some stuff about Jezebel, like, 'The dogs are gonna chow down on her by the wall of Jezreel.' (By wall, I mean ditch, FYI.)"
1 Kings,21,24,"Anyone who dies in the city, Ahab's got the dogs to feast on 'em; and anyone who dies in the field, the birds in the sky got a meal lined up for 'em."
1 Kings,21,25,"But no one was as wicked as Ahab, who completely sold himself out to do evil in the eyes of the LORD. His wife Jezebel was his partner in crime, always encouraging him to do wrong."
1 Kings,21,26,"And OMG, he was like totally doing the most disgusting thing ever by worshipping idols, just like how the Amorites used to do, but then God kicked them out before the Israelites."
1 Kings,21,27,"And like, Ahab heard what was said, and he totally freaked out and tore his clothes, and put on sackcloth, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and walked around all gentle and stuff."
1 Kings,21,28,"So, like, God spoke to Elijah the Tishbite, and this happened..."
1 Kings,21,29,"Yo, peep how Ahab is straight up humble in front of me? 'Cause he's all humble and respectful, I won't let any bad stuff happen to him while he's alive. But, his descendants gonna catch that bad energy later on in life, like, it's gonna hit his fam hard."
1 Kings,22,1,And they went on for like three whole years without any drama or fighting between Syria and Israel.
1 Kings,22,2,"So, like, after three years, it happened that Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, rolled up to meet the king of Israel."
1 Kings,22,3,"Yo, listen up, fam! The king of Israel straight up told his squad, 'Y'all know that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, right? And we just sitting here, not even snatching it from the king of Syria's grip? Like, bro, we keeping it low-key, not making any moves.'"
1 Kings,22,4,"And he was like, yo Jehoshaphat, you wanna tag along to Ramothgilead for a battle? And Jehoshaphat was like, word to the king of Israel, I got you fam. My people are your people, my horses are your horses."
1 Kings,22,5,"Yo, Jehoshaphat was like, yo king of Israel, can you do me a solid and ask the LORD for some guidance today?"
1 Kings,22,6,"So the king of Israel got all the prophets, like around 400 peeps, and asked them, 'Should I attack Ramothgilead or chill out?' And they were like, 'Dude, go for it! The Lord's got your back.'"
1 Kings,22,7,"Jehoshaphat was like, 'Yo, isn't there any other prophet from the LORD around here that we can hit up and ask?"
1 Kings,22,8,"And the king of Israel was like, 'Hey, Jehoshaphat, there's this one dude, Micaiah, son of Imlah, he's the only one we can ask God for advice, but I can't stand him! He never says anything good about me, only bad stuff.' And Jehoshaphat was like, 'Don't diss him like that, dude.'"
1 Kings,22,9,"So the king of Israel was like, 'Yo, get Micaiah the son of Imlah over here ASAP!' The king called for his officer to make it happen. (BTW, officer could also mean eunuch if you didn't know)"
1 Kings,22,10,"So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, were kicking back on their thrones, all dressed up in their fancy robes, chilling in an open area by the entrance of the gate in Samaria. And there were a bunch of prophets going at it, spittin' fire with their prophecies right in front of them."
1 Kings,22,11,"Then Zedekiah, Chenaanah's son, crafted some sick iron horns and was like, 'Yo, this is what the LORD says: Use these horns to completely wreck the Syrians until they're totally gone.'"
1 Kings,22,12,"And like, all the prophets were like, prophesying and stuff, like saying, yo, go up to Ramothgilead and like, don't worry 'bout a thing, 'cause the LORD's got your back and He's gonna deliver it into the king's hand. Fuuursho!"
1 Kings,22,13,"So the messenger who went to fetch Micaiah talked to him and said, listen up, all the prophets are totally agreeing and saying good things to please the king. Can you just say something that sounds positive and agree with them?"
1 Kings,22,14,"And Micaiah was like, I swear on everything holy, I'm only gonna say what the LORD tells me to say, no cap."
1 Kings,22,15,"So he went up to the king. And the king was like, 'Yo, Micaiah, should we hit up Ramothgilead and start a battle or should we just chill? And Micaiah was all like, 'Go for it, man! The LORD's got your back, he'll totally hand it over to you.'"
1 Kings,22,16,"The king was like, 'Seriously, dude, how many times do I have to tell you to only speak the truth in the name of the LORD?'"
1 Kings,22,17,"So, like, I was looking at all of Israel and they were like, totally scattered on the hills, you know, like sheep without a shepherd. And then the LORD was like, 'Yo, these peeps don't have anyone to lead them, so let them go home in peace.'"
1 Kings,22,18,"The king of Israel straight up told Jehoshaphat, like, 'Didn't I tell you that this dude would never say anything positive about me? Only negative vibes, man!'"
1 Kings,22,19,"Yo, listen up and pay attention to what the LORD said: I peeped the LORD chillin' on his throne, and all the heavenly squad posted up on his right and left."
1 Kings,22,20,"God was like, 'How can we convince Ahab to go to Ramothgilead and get himself killed?' And one person had this idea, while another person had a different idea. (The word 'persuade' could also mean deceive.)"
1 Kings,22,21,"Then this spirit appeared before God and said, 'I got this, I'll convince him'."
1 Kings,22,22,"And God was like, 'How are you gonna do it?' And the lying spirit was like, 'I'm gonna go and make all his prophets tell lies.' And God was like, 'Yeah, go ahead, convince him and succeed. Go and do it.'"
1 Kings,22,23,"So listen up, the LORD has made these prophets straight up spew lies and spread evil things about you."
1 Kings,22,24,"So this guy Zedekiah, Chenaanah's son, came up and straight-up slapped Micaiah across the face. Then he had the audacity to ask, 'Yo, how did the Spirit of the LORD even get to you to speak? Like, it should've come to me first, right?'"
1 Kings,22,25,"And Micaiah was like, yo, check it: when the time comes and you in a tight spot, look for a safe hideout, like a secret room within a room. Rock on."
1 Kings,22,26,"So the king of Israel was like, 'Yo, get Micaiah and take him back to Amon, the governor of the city, and also to Joash, the king's son.'"
1 Kings,22,27,"And like, the king was all like, 'Yo, put this {dude} in the slammer and give him some super plain bread and water until I come back, no drama, bro.'"
1 Kings,22,28,"And Micaiah was like, if you come back safe and sound, then the LORD definitely did not speak through me. And he was like, listen up, everyone!"
1 Kings,22,29,"So, like, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went up to this place called Ramothgilead."
1 Kings,22,30,"So, like, the king of Israel was all like, 'Yo, Jehoshaphat, I'm gonna low-key change my appearance and join the battle, but you should totally keep wearing your fancy clothes.' And then the king of Israel totally disguised himself and got in the middle of the battle. It's kind of like he was like, 'I'll just slip in unnoticed, no biggie.'"
1 Kings,22,31,"So, the king of Syria gathered his squad of 32 chariot commanders and ordered them: 'Don't waste your time battling against anyone but the king of Israel, whether they're big shots or nobodies'."
1 Kings,22,32,"So, like, when the chariot captains spotted Jehoshaphat, they were like, dude, that has to be the king of Israel! And they totally changed course to fight against him. Then Jehoshaphat straight up yelled out for help."
1 Kings,22,33,"So, like, when those chariot leaders realized it wasn't the Israelite king, they decided to stop chasing him."
1 Kings,22,34,"So there was this dude who randomly shot an arrow and ended up hitting the king of Israel in a weak spot in his armor. The king was like, 'Driver, get me out of here! I've been wounded!'"
1 Kings,22,35,"The fight was on fire that day: and the king was chilling in his swag chariot, taking on the Syrians. But when it hit evening, he went out like a boss and there was mad blood flowing from his wound into the middle of the chariot."
1 Kings,22,36,"A message spread like wildfire among the gang as the sun was setting, declaring, 'Everyone, head back to your turf, and each person return to their own hood!'"
1 Kings,22,37,"So the king passed away, and they took him to Samaria where they laid him to rest; he was buried in Samaria. {was brought: Hebrew term came}"
1 Kings,22,38,"So this person washed the chariot in the Samaria pool, and, like, the dogs totally licked up his blood. They also washed his armor, just like the LORD said they would. Pretty intense, right?"
1 Kings,22,39,"Yo, you wanna know more about Ahab and all the stuff he did? Check out the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. They've got all the deets on Ahab's acts, the sick ivory house he built, and all the lit cities he constructed."
1 Kings,22,40,"So Ahab passed away, and his son Ahaziah took over as king."
1 Kings,22,41,"So, Jehoshaphat, Asa's son, started ruling over Judah during Ahab's fourth year as the king of Israel."
1 Kings,22,42,"Jehoshaphat took the throne at the young age of thirty-five and ruled Jerusalem for a solid twenty-five years. His mom, Azubah, was the daughter of Shilhi."
1 Kings,22,43,"And like, he totally followed in the footsteps of his dad Asa, like not deviating at all, doing things that were right in the eyes of the LORD."
1 Kings,22,44,"But like, those high places were still there, ya know? People kept offering sacrifices and burning incense up there."
1 Kings,22,45,"So, basically, Jehoshaphat was like, 'Yo, let's squash the beef with the king of Israel.'"
1 Kings,22,46,"So, like, there's more stuff that Jehoshaphat did, all the powerful things he did and all the battles he fought. You can find all the deets about it in the book that's keeping track of all the cool stuff the kings of Judah did, you know?"
1 Kings,22,47,He got rid of the leftover sodomites in the land that were still around from his father Asa's time.
1 Kings,22,48,"So basically, at that time, Edom didn't have a king. They had a sort of second-in-command king, you know?"
1 Kings,22,49,"Jehoshaphat wanted to flex his ship game with some boss Tharshish ships to score mad gold from Ophir. But oh snap, those ships straight up FAILED because they got wrecked at Eziongeber. And we ain't talking ten ships, we talking ten losses."
1 Kings,22,50,"So Ahaziah, Ahab's son, asked Jehoshaphat, 'Can my peeps roll with your squad on the ships?' But Jehoshaphat was like, 'Nah, not feeling it.'"
1 Kings,22,51,"And Jehoshaphat passed away peacefully, joining his ancestors, and was laid to rest in the city of David, his father. Jehoram, his son, took over as the new ruler."
1 Kings,22,52,"So, like, this dude Ahaziah, Ahab's son, started ruling over Israel in Samaria while Jehoshaphat was king of Judah, around the seventeenth year. He stayed in power for two years, ruling over Israel."
1 Kings,22,53,"So, like, this dude totally messed up in God's eyes. He was just following in his parents' footsteps, and even took after Jeroboam, the dude who led Israel astray. Smh, not a good look."
1 Kings,22,54,"Yo, this dude was into Baal, like legit served and worshipped him. And, dang, he really ticked off the LORD God of Israel, you know, like super annoyed Him, just like his dad did. No chill."
2 Kings,1,1,So Moab straight up went against Israel once Ahab was out of the picture.
2 Kings,1,2,"So Ahaziah was hanging out in his chill chamber in Samaria when he fell through a lattice and got sick, bummer. He was like, 'Yo messengers, go ask Baalzebub, the god of Ekron, if I'm gonna bounce back from this sickness'."
2 Kings,1,3,"But this super chill angel dude was like, 'Yo, Elijah the Tishbite, get up and meet the squad sent by the king of Samaria. Tell them straight up, don't you realize there's a legit God in Israel? Why are you even bothering to ask Baalzebub, the god of Ekron?'"
2 Kings,1,4,"So, like, God was like, 'Yo, listen up! You can't get off that bed you went on, or else you're gonna die. Bye, Elijah!"
2 Kings,1,5,"And when the messengers came back to him, he asked them, why did y'all go and come back?"
2 Kings,1,6,"So, they told him this story: Some dude came up to us and said, 'Yo, go back to the king who sent you and deliver this message to him. The LORD asks, 'Why are you seeking guidance from Baalzebub, the god of Ekron, when you know there's a God in Israel?' So basically, the LORD is saying you won't be leaving that bed you climbed onto. You're gonna die for sure, man."
2 Kings,1,7,"And he's like, yo, dudes, who was that guy who came up to you and told you this stuff? What did he look like and all? Like, what's the deal with him?"
2 Kings,1,8,"And they were like, yo, he had a serious mane, and had this wicked leather belt around his waist. And this dude was like, 'Yo, that's Elijah the Tishbite!'"
2 Kings,1,9,"So the king sent a squad of 50 with their leader. They approached the man of God who was chilling up on a hill. The leader called out to him, saying, 'Hey, holy dude! The king wants you to come down.'"
2 Kings,1,10,"'Yo, so Elijah straight up responds to the captain of fifty like, 'If I'm really a man of God, then bring on that fire from heaven and let it wreck you and your whole squad.' And guess what? That fire actually came down from heaven and totally burned them all up."
2 Kings,1,11,"Then he sent another group of soldiers, about fifty of them along with their captain. The captain respectfully approached the man of God and said, 'Hey, the king wants you to come down right away.'"
2 Kings,1,12,"And Elijah was like, yo, if I'm really a man of God, then let fire rain down from heaven and wipe out you and your whole squad. And sure enough, boom! God's fire came down and totally roasted them all."
2 Kings,1,13,"Then he sent another captain with his group of fifty. The captain approached Elijah, went down on his knees, and earnestly pleaded, saying, 'Oh, man of God, I humbly ask that you value not only my life but also the lives of these fifty servants of yours.'"
2 Kings,1,14,"Yo, check it out, fire straight up rained down from the sky and totally roasted those two leaders and their crews. So, like, can you please consider my life valuable now?"
2 Kings,1,15,"And the angel of the LORD was like, 'Yo Elijah, go down with him, don't be scared, bro.' So Elijah was like, 'Alright, bet,' and went down with him to the king."
2 Kings,1,16,"And he was like, 'Yo, listen up! The LORD has something to say. So, you sent your boys to ask Baalzebub, the so-called god of Ekron, if it's because you think there's no God in Israel who can answer your questions? Well, I got news for you, bro. Since you did that, you ain't getting off that bed you climbed onto, and you're gonna die for sure.'"
2 Kings,1,17,"And just as the LORD had said through Elijah, he passed away. Then Jehoram took over as king in the second year of Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, since he didn't have any sons."
2 Kings,1,18,"Yo, all the other stuff Ahaziah did, isn't it all written down in that book about the Kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,2,1,"So, get this, when God was ready to bring Elijah up to heaven in a crazy whirlwind, Elijah rolled with Elisha from Gilgal."
2 Kings,2,2,"And Elijah was like, yo Elisha, just chill here for a sec because the big man upstairs sent me to Bethel. And Elisha was like, swear on the Lord and swear on your own life, I'm not ditching you. So they both rolled down to Bethel."
2 Kings,2,3,"So, like, these guys who were training to be prophets at Bethel came up to Elisha and said, 'Yo dude, do you know that the LORD is gonna snatch your teacher away from you today?' And Elisha was like, 'Yeah man, I'm aware, so just chill and keep quiet about it, okay?'"
2 Kings,2,4,"And Elijah was like, 'Yo Elisha, chill here for a sec, 'cause the LORD sent me to Jericho.' And Elisha was like, 'Swear, man! I ain't ditching you, not even if my life depended on it!' So they rolled up to Jericho together."
2 Kings,2,5,"So, like, the prophets' guys in Jericho went up to Elisha and were all, 'Hey, do you know that the LORD is gonna take your boss away from you today?' And Elisha was like, 'Yeah, I'm totally aware of that, so just chill and keep quiet, okay?'}"
2 Kings,2,6,"And Elijah was like, 'Yo, dude, chill here for a bit, 'cause the LORD hooked me up to go to the Jordan river.' And the other guy was like, 'OMG, swear on the LORD and your life, I'm not gonna leave you!' So they both kept going together, no doubt."
2 Kings,2,7,"Fifty dudes from the sons of the prophets went over there and took a chill spot to scope things out from a distance, while these two just kicked it by the Jordan river."
2 Kings,2,8,"Then Elijah grabbed his cloak and wrapped it up. He hit the water and bam, it split in two, opening up a path for them to walk on dry land."
2 Kings,2,9,"So, when they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, 'Yo, ask me what I can do for you before I bounce. And Elisha was like, 'Bro, please hook me up with a double dose of your spirit.'"
2 Kings,2,10,"And he was like, 'Bro, you're asking for something really difficult. But, if you actually witness me disappearing right in front of you, then okay, you can have it. But if you don't see it happen, then sorry, it's not gonna go down like that. Just saying, you asked for something pretty tough.'"
2 Kings,2,11,"While they were walking and chatting, suddenly this epic scene unfolded: a lit chariot with fire vibes and fiery horses rolled in and split the two apart; Elijah straight up ascended to heaven, riding on a whirlwind. It was insane!"
2 Kings,2,12,"Then Elisha saw it and exclaimed, 'OMG, dad, dad, you were like the ultimate ride of Israel with your sick chariot and horsemen. And just like that, you were gone. Elisha couldn't handle it, so he pulled a serious fashion move, tearing his clothes into two pieces."
2 Kings,2,13,"Then he picked up Elijah's cool jacket that fell off him, and went back and stood by the riverside, you know, by the Jordan River. Just saying, 'bank' in Hebrew is 'lip',"
2 Kings,2,14,"So he grabbed Elijah's jacket that had fallen from him, and hit the water, saying, 'Where's the LORD God of Elijah?' And when he hit the water too, it split apart, making a path for Elisha to cross."
2 Kings,2,15,"And when the dudes who followed the prophets and were hanging out in Jericho caught sight of Elisha, they were like, 'Yo, Elijah's spirit is totally on him!' So they went up to him, paid mad respect, and bowed down before him."
2 Kings,2,16,"Yo, listen up! So, like, check it: we got around fifty tough dudes here, right? How 'bout we send 'em vibes to go find your master, just in case the Spirit of the LORD, like, whisked him away to some mountain or valley or sumthin'. But the dude was like, nah, don't even bother sending 'em."
2 Kings,2,17,"And when they kept bugging him until he couldn't take it anymore, he was like, 'Fine, whatever.' So they sent fifty dudes to look for three whole days, but they couldn't find him anywhere."
2 Kings,2,18,"So, when they came back to him, (because he was chilling in Jericho,) he straight up told them, 'Didn't I already tell y'all not to go?'"
2 Kings,2,19,"So the guys in the city were like, yo Elisha, check out this city, it looks pretty cool, right? But dude, our water is totally messed up, and the ground here can't grow anything. It sucks, man."
2 Kings,2,20,"Then he was like, yo, get me a fresh container and put salt in it. And they brought it to him."
2 Kings,2,21,"So he went to this sick water source, and just Yeeted some salt in there, and was like, 'Yo, listen up! The big man upstairs said I've healed this water, so no more death or boring dryness in this place.'"
2 Kings,2,22,"So like, the water totally got healed and it's been that way till today, just like what Elisha said would happen."
2 Kings,2,23,"So, he left that place and went up to Bethel. And as he was walking along, a group of kids came out of the city and started making fun of him, saying, 'Hey, Mr. Baldie, go up! Hey, Mr. Baldie, go up!'"
2 Kings,2,24,"Then he turned around and saw them, and he got really angry and called down some serious bad vibes in the name of the LORD. And out of nowhere, two angry she-bears came charging out of the woods and totally wrecked forty-two of those kids."
2 Kings,2,25,"Then he went to Mount Carmel, and after that, he headed back to Samaria."
2 Kings,3,1,"So, like, Jehoram, Ahab's kid, became the ruler of Israel in Samaria, when Jehoshaphat had been ruling Judah for eighteen years, and he was in power for twelve years."
2 Kings,3,2,"And he did bad stuff that made God unhappy; but it wasn't as bad as what his dad and mom did. He got rid of that idol thingy that his dad made called Baal. (BTW, Baal was like a statue or something)"
2 Kings,3,3,"But he still kept doing the same messed up stuff as Jeroboam, which got Israel all caught up in sin - he didn't stop doing it."
2 Kings,3,4,"Yo, Mesha, the king of Moab, was totally a boss when it came to raising sheep. He straight up gave the king of Israel a whopping 100,000 lambs and 100,000 rams, plus all that wool. Respect!"
2 Kings,3,5,"So, like, once Ahab was gone, the king of Moab totally went against the king of Israel. Can you believe it?"
2 Kings,3,6,So King Jehoram left Samaria at that time and counted all of Israel.
2 Kings,3,7,"So he texted Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, and was like, 'Dude, the king of Moab totally turned against me. Wanna team up and take Moab down in a battle?' And Jehoshaphat was all, 'I'm in! We're like BFFs, my people are your people, and my horses are your horses.'"
2 Kings,3,8,"So he's like, 'Yo, which direction should we head?' And the other dude's like, 'Bro, the path goes through the Edom desert.'"
2 Kings,3,9,"So the kings of Israel, Judah, and Edom teamed up and took a detour that lasted a whole week. But hey, guess what? They ran out of water for both the army and the animals. It was a major problem."
2 Kings,3,10,"OMG, the king of Israel was like, so devastated! He couldn't believe that the LORD brought these three kings together just to let Moab defeat them! Like, what a bummer!"
2 Kings,3,11,"But Jehoshaphat was like, yo, is there a prophet of the LORD up in here? We need to find out what the LORD has to say. Then one of the king of Israel's servants was like, oh yeah, we got Elisha, son of Shaphat. He used to chill with Elijah and pour water on his hands and stuff."
2 Kings,3,12,"Jehoshaphat was like, yo, this dude got that divine knowledge on lock. So the kings of Israel, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom rolled up to him."
2 Kings,3,13,"So Elisha was like, 'Yo, why are you even talking to me? Go consult your parents' prophets.' Then the king of Israel was like, 'No way, man. The LORD brought us three kings here to hand us over to Moab.'"
2 Kings,3,14,"Yo, I need to keep it real with you. Swear on the highest authority, the LORD of hosts, the one I'm serving. If it wasn't for Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, being here, I wouldn't even bother looking at you or acknowledging your presence."
2 Kings,3,15,"Yo, grab me a sick musician right now. So, when this musician starts jamming, the power of the Lord vibes with him, you feel me?"
2 Kings,3,16,"And God was like, yo, listen up fam, I got a message for ya. Fill up this whole valley with ditches, okay?"
2 Kings,3,17,"So listen up, fam! God says you won't even see the wind or the rain, but guess what? That valley is gonna get filled with water, enough for you, your pets, and all your livestock to drink up."
2 Kings,3,18,"And like, this is not a big deal for God, okay? He's totally gonna make sure you kick the Moabites' butts too."
2 Kings,3,19,"You gotta wreck every fortified city, every cool city, and cut down every amazing tree, and block all water sources, and mess up every good piece of land with stones. (mess up: in Hebrew it means to make sad)"
2 Kings,3,20,"And the next morning, when they were making the food offering, something crazy happened: water started flowing from the direction of Edom, and the whole land got flooded!"
2 Kings,3,21,"And when all the Moabites found out that the kings were about to attack them, they called together all those who could suit up and get ready for battle, and they positioned themselves at the border."
2 Kings,3,22,"So, like, they woke up super early in the morning, and the sun was all beaming down on the water, and the Moabites, yo, they saw that the water on the other side was legit red, like blood and stuff."
2 Kings,3,23,"And they were like, dude, this is blood! The kings totally went at it and killed each other. So now, Moab, let's go grab all their stuff!"
2 Kings,3,24,"So, when the Israelites reached the Israelite camp, they totally defeated the Moabites, causing them to run away scared. But not stopping there, they kept on attacking the Moabites in their own turf. It was an absolute smackdown!"
2 Kings,3,25,"So they totally wrecked the cities, on every prime spot of land each person threw their own rocks, filling it up. They blocked all the water wells and chopped down all the good trees, except in Kirharaseth they left the stones behind. But then the slingers went around and attacked it."
2 Kings,3,26,"So, like, when the king of Moab realized he was totally getting wrecked in battle, he got together a squad of 700 sword-wielding soldiers, thinking they could break through and reach the king of Edom. But guess what? They couldn't. Epic fail, bro."
2 Kings,3,27,"So he sacrificed his oldest son, who was supposed to be the next ruler, as a burnt offering on the wall. This seriously ticked off Israel and they ditched him, going back to their own land."
2 Kings,4,1,"So this woman, who was married to one of the prophets' sons, came to Elisha and said, 'Yo, my husband, your boy, passed away. And you know he had mad respect for the LORD. But now, the creditor is here tryna take my two sons as slaves.'"
2 Kings,4,2,"Elisha was like, 'Yo, what can I do for ya? Spill the tea, what do you have in the crib?' And the woman was like, 'Sorry, but I'm totally broke. I only have this little jar of oil.'"
2 Kings,4,3,"And he was like, 'Yo, go out and ask your neighbors if you can borrow their empty vessels. Don't just ask for a few, borrow as many as you can, no cap.'"
2 Kings,4,4,"Once you're inside, close the door behind you and your squad, then flex by pouring into all those lit containers and set aside the ones that are fully stacked."
2 Kings,4,5,"So she left him and closed the door with her and her sons who had brought the stuff to her, and she spilled it all out."
2 Kings,4,6,"When all the containers were filled up, she said to her son, 'Yo, grab me another container.' And he was like, 'Nah, there ain't no more containers left.' And the oil stopped flowing."
2 Kings,4,7,"So she went and told the prophet guy. And he was like, yo, sell the oil and use the money to pay off your debt. Then you can live with your kids on the leftover cash. #NoMoreBills"
2 Kings,4,8,"So, one day, Elisha went to Shunem where he met this amazing woman. She insisted that he join her for a meal. And from that day forward, whenever he passed by, he would stop by and have a bite to eat. Can you believe it? This woman was just so awesome that she had such an impact on Elisha that he couldn't resist her invitation!"
2 Kings,4,9,"And she was like, yo, hubby, check it out, I'm getting major vibes that this dude passing by is a legit holy man of God."
2 Kings,4,10,"Hey, how about we create a chill space, like a mini room on the wall? We can put a bed, a table, a stool, and a cool candle holder there. So when he comes to visit, he can crash there."
2 Kings,4,11,"So, one day, he arrives at the place, goes into the room, and crashes there."
2 Kings,4,12,"Yo, tell Gehazi, your sidekick, to hit up this Shunammite chick. And when he finally got her on the line, she showed up in front of him."
2 Kings,4,13,"And he was like, yo, go tell her, like wow, you've been looking out for us so much, what can we do to thank you? Do you want us to put in a good word for you with the king or the boss? And she was like, nah, I'm good, I'm chilling with my own peeps."
2 Kings,4,14,"And he was like, okay, what can we do to help her out? And Gehazi was like, bro, she doesn't have any kids and her husband is, like, ancient."
2 Kings,4,15,"Then he was like, 'Yo, call her.' And when he did, she came and stood by the door."
2 Kings,4,16,"And he was like, yo, in about this specific time, you're gonna be hugging up on a son. And she was like, nah, my dude, you, the man of God, better not be straight up lying to your girl."
2 Kings,4,17,"And the lady got pregnant and gave birth to a son just like Elisha had predicted, at the right time in her life."
2 Kings,4,18,"So, like, when the kid got older, one day he went out to his dad who was working with the reapers."
2 Kings,4,19,"And he's like, yo pops, my head hurts so bad. And he's like, dude, go tell that kid to take you to your mom."
2 Kings,4,20,"And after he was taken and brought to his mother, he sat on her lap until noon, and then passed away."
2 Kings,4,21,"And she went up and put him on the man of God's bed and closed the door on him, then bounced outta there."
2 Kings,4,22,"So she texts her husband and asks him to hook her up with one of the epic boys and one of the cool rides, so she can zoom to the man of God and come back."
2 Kings,4,23,"And he was like, why are you even going to him today? It's not the new moon or sabbath or anything. And she was all like, it's gonna be fine, no worries."
2 Kings,4,24,"So she got a ride ready and told her servant to hurry up and go, without holding back, unless she says otherwise."
2 Kings,4,25,"So she went and found the man of God at mount Carmel. And when the man of God saw her from a distance, he said to his servant Gehazi, 'Look, there goes that Shunammite woman.'"
2 Kings,4,26,"Yo, go quickly and meet her, then ask her how she's doin'. Are things going good for you? Is your husband doing alright? Is the kid alright? And she replied, 'Everything's all good.'"
2 Kings,4,27,"So, she went up to the man of God on the hill and grabbed onto his feet, but Gehazi tried to push her away. But the man of God said, 'Leave her alone, her spirit is troubled deep down, and the LORD has kept it a secret from me, and hasn't told me yet.'"
2 Kings,4,28,"And she was like, wait, did I ask for a kid from you? I straight up told you not to play games with me!"
2 Kings,4,29,"Yo, Gehazi, get ready and grab my staff. Go on your way—don't greet anyone you meet, and if someone greets you, don't respond. Just put my staff on the kid's face."
2 Kings,4,30,"And the kid's mom was like, 'OMG, I swear to God and swear on my life, I'm not gonna abandon you.' So, the child got up and started following her."
2 Kings,4,31,"Gehazi went ahead of them and gently placed the staff on the child's face, but nothing happened. So he went back to meet Elisha and said, 'Sorry, but the child didn't wake up.'"
2 Kings,4,32,"So, when Elisha entered the house, guess what? The child was dead, just lying there on the bed."
2 Kings,4,33,"So, he went inside and closed the door behind him, leaving just the two of them. Then, he started praying to the LORD."
2 Kings,4,34,"And he climbed up onto the bed, and leaned over the kid, and pressed his lips against its lips, and his eyes against its eyes, and his hands against its hands: and he stretched himself out over the kid; and the body of the kid felt warm."
2 Kings,4,35,"Then he went back inside and started pacing back and forth, and went up to the child and stretched himself out on him. And the kid sneezed seven times, and finally opened his eyes. {to and fro: Hebrew meaning moving back and forth}"
2 Kings,4,36,"And he was like, yo Gehazi, hit up that Shunammite girl. So he hit her up and when she came to him, he was like, take your kid with you."
2 Kings,4,37,"So she walked in, and went straight to him, and like totally prostrated herself on the floor, and like picked up her son, and then left."
2 Kings,4,38,"So Elisha went back to Gilgal, and there was a major shortage of food in the land. The guys who were training to become prophets were hanging out with him, and he told his assistant, 'Get the big pot and cook some soup for the guys.'"
2 Kings,4,39,"And someone went to the field to collect herbs, and they found a super random vine with a bunch of these wild squash things. They grabbed a ton and then chopped them up and tossed them into the pot of soup because they had no clue what they were."
2 Kings,4,40,"So they served the food for the guys to eat. And while they were munching on the soup, they freaked out and said, 'Yo, man of God, this is some deadly stuff in the pot!' And they couldn't eat it for real."
2 Kings,4,41,"But he was like, yo, bring me some meal. So he threw it in the pot and was like, serve it up to the homies so they can eat. And guess what? The pot was all good, no bad vibes or anything."
2 Kings,4,42,"So there was this dude from Baalshalisha who brought the man of God some fresh vibes - twenty loaves of barley bread and fully loaded corn on the cob. And he was like, 'Yo, feed the people with this!' {the husk...: or, his scrip, or, garment}"
2 Kings,4,43,"And his servant was like, um, are you serious? Are you expecting me to serve this to a hundred people? But he was like, yup, give it to them anyways. Cuz God said, they're gonna eat and still have leftovers, so we good."
2 Kings,4,44,"Then he put it in front of them, and they chowed down and had leftovers, just like the LORD said."
2 Kings,5,1,"Yo, Naaman, the big shot captain of the king of Syria's crew, was straight up impressive and respected 'cause the Lord had helped him make Syria win battles and stuff. He was also pretty darn brave, but here's the thing, he had a case of leprosy. Like, it wasn't a good look, ya know?"
2 Kings,5,2,"So, like, the Syrians went out in groups and, like, kidnapped this girl from Israel and she became, like, a servant for Naaman's wife."
2 Kings,5,3,"And she was like, yo, imagine if my boss had the hookup with that prophet in Samaria! He could totally cure him of his leprosy and stuff. Like, for real!"
2 Kings,5,4,"So this person went in and told their boss, like, yo, check it, this girl from Israel said something like this and that."
2 Kings,5,5,"So, like, the King of Syria was like, 'Yo, listen up, I'm gonna send a letter to the King of Israel.' So he bounced and took with him ten talents of silver, six thousand pieces of gold, and ten outfits. Oh, and just so you know, 'with...in his hand' means he took it all with him."
2 Kings,5,6,"So, this message was taken to the king of Israel, like 'yo, when you get this letter, check it, I'm sending Naaman, my servant, to you. He needs help with his leprosy, bro."
2 Kings,5,7,"So, like, the king of Israel gets this letter, right? And he's, like, totally shook! He tears his clothes and goes, 'Dude, am I, like, God or something? Can I just kill and bring people back to life? This guy wants me to cure his leprosy or whatever. Can you believe he's tryna pick a fight with me? Seriously, think about it, guys! It's so not cool.'"
2 Kings,5,8,"So, like, when Elisha, this legit dude who's close to God, found out that the king of Israel tore his clothes in distress, he sent a message to the king, being all like, 'Why'd you tear your clothes, man? Come see me, and you'll realize there's a true prophet here in Israel.'"
2 Kings,5,9,"So Naaman rolls up with his dope horses and sick chariot, and parks at the entrance of Elisha's crib, straight flexin'."
2 Kings,5,10,"So Elisha hit him up with a DM, like, 'Yo, go and take a dip in the Jordan River seven times, and you'll be all good - your skin will be back and you'll be squeaky clean fam'."
2 Kings,5,11,"But Naaman was mad and left, saying, 'Dude, I totally thought this guy was gonna come out, like, flex and shout to his God, and do some kind of cool magic hand wave thing, and BAM, no more leprosy.'"
2 Kings,5,12,"Like, seriously? Are Abana and Pharpar, those rivers in Damascus, supposed to be better than all the waters in Israel? Can't I just wash myself there and be clean? And then, in a fit of anger, he just stormed off. You know, Abana, or whatever it's called."
2 Kings,5,13,"And his homies approached him and were like, yo pops, if the prophet told you to do something major, wouldn't you do it? So why not just listen to him when he says, 'Yo, cleanse yourself and be fresh'?"
2 Kings,5,14,"So he went down and took a dip in the Jordan River, just like the man of God told him to. And guess what? His skin became all fresh and smooth, like that of a newborn baby. He was totally clean!"
2 Kings,5,15,"Then he went back to the man of God with all his crew, stood before him, and said, 'Look, I get it now. The only true God is in Israel. So, please, accept this gift from your humble servant.'"
2 Kings,5,16,"He's like, bro, I swear on the Lord's name, the one I stand before, I ain't taking anything. He kept pushing him to take it, but he was like, nah, I'm good."
2 Kings,5,17,"And Naaman was like, yo, can I like, get a couple of loads of dirt? Cuz I'm totally done with offering burnt sacrifices to other gods. From now on, I'm all about worshipping the LORD."
2 Kings,5,18,"Yo, God, forgive me for this one. So, when my boss goes to worship this god named Rimmon and leans on me for support, and I gotta bow down with him in Rimmon's house, I hope you'll pardon me for doing it too."
2 Kings,5,19,"And he was like, 'Yo, take it easy bro.' So he bounced out of there, just a few steps away. {a little...: It was just a small distance}"
2 Kings,5,20,"But Gehazi, Elisha's servant, straight up said, yo, check it, my master totally let Naaman off the hook, the Syrian dude, by not accepting the stuff he brought. But, I swear on the Lord's name, I'm gonna chase after him and grab something from him."
2 Kings,5,21,"Gehazi decided to chase after Naaman. When Naaman noticed him running towards him, he hopped off his chariot to greet him and asked, 'Yo, what's up? Everything cool?'"
2 Kings,5,22,"And he was like, 'Everything's good, dude.' My boss sent me a message and he was like, 'Yo, check it out, two young dudes from mount Ephraim, they're like sons of the prophets or something, just arrived. Can you hook them up with like a ton of cash and a couple of fresh outfits?'"
2 Kings,5,23,"Naaman was like, 'Yo, be cool, bro, take these two talents.' And he kept insisting, so he put two bags filled with silver, along with two sets of clothes, on two of his servants. They carried it all in front of him."
2 Kings,5,24,"And when he reached the tower, he grabbed {them} from their hand, and placed {them} in the house. Then he set the dudes free, and they left. {tower: or, secret place}"
2 Kings,5,25,"So he went in and stood in front of his master. And Elisha asked him, 'Where you been at, Gehazi?' And he replied, 'I haven't been anywhere, boss, nowhere at all.'"
2 Kings,5,26,"And he was like, dude, did my heart not go with you when that guy turned around from his ride to greet you? Is this like, the right moment to be accepting money, clothes, fancy gardens, vineyards, animals, and people to work for you and clean your stuff?"
2 Kings,5,27,"So Naaman's leprosy will stick to you and to your descendants forever. And Naaman left his presence completely covered in leprosy, like pure white snow."
2 Kings,6,1,"So, the bros from the prophet gang were like, 'Yo Elisha, check it, the spot we're crashin' at with you is mad cramped, man.'"
2 Kings,6,2,"Yo, let's go to Jordan and grab a beam each to build ourselves a dope crib. Dude was like, 'Yeah, go for it'."
2 Kings,6,3,"And someone was like, yo, chill and come kick it with us, bro. And he's like, bet, I'm down."
2 Kings,6,4,"So he like went with them, no cap. And when they pull up at Jordan, they start slaying wood, you know what I'm saying?"
2 Kings,6,5,"So like, while this one dude was cutting down a beam, the axe head like, totally fell into the water. And he freaked out, and was like, 'Yo, master! That axe head was borrowed, dude!'"
2 Kings,6,6,"The guy who speaks for God asked, 'Where did it fall?' And the other guy showed him the spot. Then the guy grabbed a stick, threw it in there, and believe it or not, the metal floated."
2 Kings,6,7,"So, he was like, 'Yo, pick that stuff up.' And then he reached out his hand and grabbed it."
2 Kings,6,8,"So, like, the king of Syria started this war against Israel, and he gathered his crew and was like, 'Okay, let's set up camp in this specific spot.'"
2 Kings,6,9,"yo, the man of God hit up the king of Israel and was like, 'yo, don't even go near that spot, 'cause the Syrians rolled through there."
2 Kings,6,10,"So the king of Israel slid into the DMs of the spot that the man of God mentioned and gave him a heads up. And he stayed there to keep himself out of trouble, not just once, but multiple times."
2 Kings,6,11,"The king of Syria was freaking out because of this, so he gathered his squad and asked them, 'Yo, can someone tell me who among us is spying for the king of Israel?'"
2 Kings,6,12,"One of his servants was like, 'Nah, my dude, O king. But yo, Elisha, the prophet from Israel, straight up be telling the king of Israel all the stuff you be saying in your crib.'"
2 Kings,6,13,"So he's like, 'Yo, go check where he's at, so I can send for him.' And then someone was like, 'Listen up, he's chillin' in Dothan, just so you know.'"
2 Kings,6,14,"So he sent a whole squad of horses, chariots, and a massive crew. They arrived under the cover of night and surrounded the city completely. {heavy: meaning huge}"
2 Kings,6,15,"So, when the servant of the man of God woke up, went outside, they saw that the city was surrounded by a huge army with horses and chariots. The servant freaked out and said, 'Oh no, boss! What are we gonna do now?'"
2 Kings,6,16,"And he was like, don't even trip: we got way more people on our side than they do on theirs."
2 Kings,6,17,"So Elisha was like, 'Yo, God, please open this guy's eyes so he can see what's really going on.' And guess what? God did it! The young dude's eyes were opened and bam! He could see that the whole mountain was packed with these sick horses and fire chariots, all surrounding Elisha! It was lit!"
2 Kings,6,18,"So, when they went up to Elisha, he talked to God and was like, 'Hey, could you please make these people blind?' And then they actually became blind, just like Elisha said."
2 Kings,6,19,"And Elisha was like, 'Nah, guys, you're going in the wrong direction and this ain't even the right city. Follow me and I'll take you to the guy you're looking for.' So, he led them to Samaria. #NoWorries, just come with me."
2 Kings,6,20,"So, like, when they arrived in Samaria, Elisha was all like, 'Yo, LORD, give these dudes some epic vision.' And guess what? The LORD totally hooked them up, and boom! They could see everything around them in Samaria."
2 Kings,6,21,"The king of Israel asks Elisha, 'Hey, dude, should I like, totally go all out and attack them? Should I hit them or what?'"
2 Kings,6,22,"And he was like, yo, don't go all violent on those peeps: why would you wanna harm the ones you captured with your weapon? Just give 'em some grub and H2O, let 'em eat, drink, and bounce back to their boss."
2 Kings,6,23,"And he made sure there was a ton of food and drinks for them. After they filled themselves up, he sent them back to their boss. From then on, the Syrian bands never came back to the land of Israel."
2 Kings,6,24,"So like, later on, Benhadad, the king of Syria, got all his squad together and rolled up to Samaria, ready to put it on lockdown"
2 Kings,6,25,"Yo, there was this huge famine in Samaria, like, legit bad vibes. And yo, they had the city under siege and it got so desperate that they were selling an ass's head for, like, 80 pieces of silver, and like, a tiny bit of dove's dung for five pieces of silver. Talk about crazy times, man."
2 Kings,6,26,"So, like, the king of Israel was just, you know, strolling along on this wall, when suddenly this woman starts yelling for help, you know? She's all like, 'Yo! My lord, O king, help me!'"
2 Kings,6,27,"And he was like, if God doesn't help you, where do you expect me to help you from? From the farming tools or from the grape crushing machine? God forbid I save you myself."
2 Kings,6,28,"The king was like, yo, what's up with you? And she was like, this other chick straight up told me to give my son so we can feast on him today, and then tomorrow we eat my son. Like, what?!"
2 Kings,6,29,"So, like, we were super desperate, and we ended up cooking and eating my own son. Then, I was all like, 'Yo, give me your son so we can eat him too.' But she straight up hid her son and didn't give him to us."
2 Kings,6,30,"So, like, when the king heard what the woman said, he totally freaked out and ripped his clothes. Then he went along the wall, and everyone was staring at him, and guess what? He was wearing sackcloth under his clothes, like, against his skin."
2 Kings,6,31,"And he was like, yo, I swear on everything, if Elisha the son of Shaphat isn't toast by the end of today, may God unleash some major consequences on me."
2 Kings,6,32,"But Elisha was chilling at home, vibing with the elders. Then, the king sent a dude to see him, but before the messenger arrived, Elisha said to the elders, 'Yo, peep how this killer's offspring is tryna snatch my head? When the messenger comes, lock the door and keep him outside. Can't you hear his master's footsteps approaching?'"
2 Kings,6,33,"As they were having a convo, suddenly a messenger showed up and said, 'Yo, this bad situation is from the LORD. Should I even bother waiting for the LORD any longer?'"
2 Kings,7,1,"So Elisha was like, listen up fam! The word of the LORD is this: Tomorrow at this exact time, you're gonna find some top-quality flour for just a shekel, and two servings of barley for the same price, right there at the entrance of Samaria."
2 Kings,7,2,"So this dude, who was like the king's right-hand man, had the nerve to answer the man of God and be like, 'Yo, even if God opened up windows in heaven, could this really happen?' And the man of God straight up told him, 'Listen up, you'll see it happen but you won't get to enjoy it.'"
2 Kings,7,3,"Yo, there were these four dudes with leprosy chillin' at the entrance of the gate. They were like, 'Why are we just sittin' here waitin' to kick the bucket?'"
2 Kings,7,4,"Like, if we're like, 'Let's go into the city,' then there's, like, a legit famine in the city and we'll totally die there. And if we just chill here, we'll still die. So, like, let's go and surrender to the Syrian army, and if they spare us, we can live, you know? And if they, like, kill us, well, we'll just be dead, no biggie."
2 Kings,7,5,"And they like totally sneaked out in the evening, to head towards the camp of the Syrians: and when they reached the farthest edge of the Syrian camp, guess what? There wasn't a single soul to be found."
2 Kings,7,6,"Yo, the Lord totally freaked out the Syrians by making them hear a bunch of chariots and horses, like a massive army or something. And they were all like, 'OMG, the king of Israel totally hired the kings of the Hittites and Egyptians to attack us!'"
2 Kings,7,7,"So they like, totally panicked and dipped in the evening, abandoning their tents, horses, and donkeys - basically everything at the camp. They straight up ran for their lives, no cap."
2 Kings,7,8,"And when these lepers reached the farthest edge of the camp, they went into one tent and had a feast, enjoying some delicious food and drinks. They also took some silver, gold, and fancy clothes from there and went to hide it. Then they went into another tent and took even more valuable things and hid it there."
2 Kings,7,9,"Then they were like talking to each other, and they were like, 'Yo, we messed up big time, dude. Today is like such a lit day with all these good news, but we're just chilling here in silence like total noobs. If we wait till morning, something bad is gonna go down, for real. So let's go and spill the beans to the king's squad, ASAP. Otherwise, we might get some serious punishment, you know?'}"
2 Kings,7,10,"So, like, they went and called the security dude of the city, and they were all like, 'Yo, listen up! We went to the Syrians' camp and guess what? There was nobody! Like, seriously, no one was there, no voices or anything. Just horses and donkeys tied up, and the tents were just chillin' as they were before.'"
2 Kings,7,11,"And he called the porters, and they told it to the king's house within."
2 Kings,7,12,"So, like, the king woke up in the middle of the night and was all like, 'Yo, guys, listen up! I'm gonna spill the tea on what those Syrians did to us. They totally know we're starving and stuff, so they sneakily left our camp and hid in the fields. They're probably thinking, 'When those peeps leave the city, we can totally capture them and take over the city.'"
2 Kings,7,13,"And one of his servants was like, yo, let's take five of the horses that are still chillin' in the city. They're pretty much all that's left of the Israelites, like, all of 'em that didn't get wiped out, you know? We should send 'em out and see what's up. (in the city: like, in there)"
2 Kings,7,14,"So they grabbed two sick rides, and the king slid into DMs of the Syrian squad, like 'Yo, go scope them out.'"
2 Kings,7,15,"So they followed them all the way to Jordan, and, guess what, the whole path was covered in clothes and stuff that the Syrians had ditched in a hurry. And then the messengers came back and spilled the tea to the king."
2 Kings,7,16,"And the peeps went out and raided the tents of the Syrians. So, like, a bag of fancy flour costed a shekel, and you could get two bags of barley for the same price. All in accordance with what the LORD said, you know?"
2 Kings,7,17,"So the king gave the guy he trusted the most the important job of guarding the gate. But the crowd accidentally trampled all over him at the gate, and he died, just like the man of God predicted when the king went to see him."
2 Kings,7,18,"So, like, the king was chillin' with the man of God, right? And the man of God was all, 'Yo, tomorrow at this time, you'll be able to score two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, at the gate of Samaria.'"
2 Kings,7,19,"So the boss guy was like, 'Dude, seriously? Can you believe if the big man upstairs actually made windows in the sky? Like, impossible!' And the man of God was like, 'Just you wait, you'll see it happen right before your very eyes, but you won't get to enjoy it.'"
2 Kings,7,20,"And that's what happened to him: because everyone stepped all over him at the gate, and he died."
2 Kings,8,1,"So, Elisha was talking to the woman whose son he brought back to life, and he was like, 'Yo, get up and take your family somewhere else, wherever you can find a place to stay. The big man upstairs called for a famine, and it's gonna hit the land for seven years.'"
2 Kings,8,2,Then the woman got up and did what the man of God said. She took her fam and lived in Philistine territory for seven years.
2 Kings,8,3,"After seven years, the lady came back from Philistine territory and decided to approach the king to plead for her house and land."
2 Kings,8,4,"So the king like chatted with Gehazi, who's, like, the servant of this super holy dude, and he's all like, 'Yo, spill the tea, bro! Let me know all the epic stuff that Elisha has pulled off.'"
2 Kings,8,5,"So, like, while he was sharing with the king how he brought back a dead person to life, this woman, whose son he revived, straight up starts crying to the king, asking for her crib and her property. And then Gehazi, he's all like, 'Yo king, this chick and her kid right here, they're the ones Elisha brought back to life.'"
2 Kings,8,6,"So, like, when the king asked the woman, she spilled the tea. And then the king was like, 'Alright, I got you.' And he assigned this specific person, like, this officer or whatever, to make sure she gets everything back that was hers, including all the crops that were grown since the day she left, up until now. You know, no one's messing with her stuff anymore."
2 Kings,8,7,"So Elisha rolls up to Damascus, right? And guess what? Benhadad, the king of Syria, is feeling under the weather. Word gets out that the man of God has made his grand entrance in town, ya feel me?"
2 Kings,8,8,"So the king was like, yo Hazael, grab a gift and go meet the man of God. Ask him to speak to the LORD, like, will I get better from this sickness or what?"
2 Kings,8,9,"So Hazael went to hang out with him and brought a sick gift from Damascus, like all the cool stuff, on the backs of forty camels. He pulled up and stood in front of him, and was like, 'Yo, your son Benhadad, the king of Syria, sent me. He's wondering if he'll recover from this sickness?' {with...: like, he had the gift in his hand}"
2 Kings,8,10,"Elisha was like, 'Yo, go tell him he'll totally bounce back, but the big man upstairs told me that he's gonna kick the bucket for real."
2 Kings,8,11,"And he stared without flinching, until he felt embarrassed: and the holy person started crying."
2 Kings,8,12,"And Hazael was like, Yo, why you crying, my lord? And he replied, Bruh, I'm crying 'cause I know all the messed up stuff you're gonna do to the children of Israel. You gonna straight up burn down their fortresses, kill their young dudes with swords, and brutally attack their pregnant women and kids. It's just heavy, man."
2 Kings,8,13,"And Hazael was like, hold up, am I some kind of dog that I should do this epic thing? But Elisha was like, yo, the LORD straight up revealed to me that you're gonna be the king of Syria."
2 Kings,8,14,"So he left Elisha and went to his boss, who asked him, 'What did Elisha say to you?' And he replied, 'He told me that you'll definitely get better.'"
2 Kings,8,15,"The next day, he grabbed a big cloth, dunked it in water, and put it over his face. He ended up dying, and Hazael took over as king."
2 Kings,8,16,"And in the fifth year of Joram, the son of Ahab, ruling as king of Israel, Jehoshaphat, who was the king of Judah at that time, passed the torch to his son, Jehoram, who took over as the new king of Judah."
2 Kings,8,17,"He was 32 years old when he became king, and he ruled over Jerusalem for 8 years."
2 Kings,8,18,"And he totally followed the footsteps of the kings of Israel, just like the fam of Ahab: 'cause he married the daughter of Ahab, and he did all kinds of messed up things that totally didn't sit well with the LORD."
2 Kings,8,19,"But the LORD didn't want to wipe out Judah because of his promise to David, his loyal servant. He promised to always bring hope to David and his descendants."
2 Kings,8,20,"Back in the day, Edom totally did their own thing and ditched Judah. They went ahead and crowned their own king and everything."
2 Kings,8,21,"So Joram went to Zair with all his crew of chariots. And then, under the cover of darkness, he launched a surprise attack on the Edomites who were surrounding him, taking down both the chariot leaders and the captains. The Edomite forces were left stunned and the remaining people fled back to their tents."
2 Kings,8,22,"But Edom said, 'Nah, we outta here!' and broke away from Judah, and they're still doin' their own thing till now. And then Libnah was like, 'Same energy!' and rebelled too."
2 Kings,8,23,"Yo, like, everything else Joram did, and all the deets, are they not all written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,8,24,"And Joram passed away, joining his ancestors, and was laid to rest in the city of David. Afterward, his son Ahaziah took over as ruler. {Ahaziah: also known as Azariah and Jehoahaz}"
2 Kings,8,25,"So, like, in the twelfth year of Joram, you know, Ahab's son, being all king of Israel and stuff, Ahaziah, Jehoram's son, started his reign as king of Judah."
2 Kings,8,26,"Ahaziah was 22 years old when he became king, and he ruled over Jerusalem for one year. His mom, Athaliah, was the daughter of Omri, who was the king of Israel."
2 Kings,8,27,"And he totally followed in the footsteps of the house of Ahab, and did some seriously messed up stuff that the LORD was not happy about, just like the house of Ahab did. 'Cause you know what? He was actually married into the house of Ahab. Yikes!"
2 Kings,8,28,"So, like, he totally joined forces with Joram, you know, Ahab's son, to face off against Hazael, the king of Syria in Ramothgilead. And dang, those Syrians totally got the best of Joram and gave him some serious wounds."
2 Kings,8,29,"So King Joram went to Jezreel to get patched up from the beat down he got from the Syrians in Ramah while fighting against Hazael, the king of Syria. And Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, the king of Judah, went to visit Joram, the son of Ahab, in Jezreel because he was injured."
2 Kings,9,1,"Elisha, the prophet, told one of the young prophets, 'Get ready and grab this tub of oil, then head over to Ramothgilead.'"
2 Kings,9,2,"When you get there, find this guy named Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat and Nimshi. Tell him to get up from hanging out with his bros and bring him to a private room within a room."
2 Kings,9,3,"Now grab that oil bottle, pour it all over his head and be like, 'Yo, God said you're the king of Israel'. After that, bolt out the door as fast as you can and don't look back, man."
2 Kings,9,4,"And then this young dude, who also happens to be a prophet, went over to Ramothgilead."
2 Kings,9,5,"And when he arrived, like, the head honchos of the squad were chilling there, and he was like, 'Yo, I got a message for you, Captain.' And Jehu was all like, 'Uh, which one of us you talkin' to?' And he was all like, 'Nah, man, I mean you, Captain.'"
2 Kings,9,6,"So, he got up and went inside the house. He took the oil and poured it on his head, and then he said to him, 'Yo, this is what the LORD God of Israel is saying: I've chosen you to be the king over the people of the LORD, like, specifically over Israel."
2 Kings,9,7,"You gotta wreck the crib of Ahab, your boss, so I can get back at Jezebel for spillin' the blood of my crew, the prophets, and all the LORD's homies."
2 Kings,9,8,The entire Ahab crew is going down: I'll wipe out all the dudes who pee standing up and those who are left in Israel!
2 Kings,9,9,"And I'm gonna totally wreck Ahab's fam, just like I did to Jeroboam, Nebat's kid, and Baasha, Ahijah's son."
2 Kings,9,10,"And, like, the dogs are totally gonna devour Jezebel in Jezreel, and there won't be anyone to give her a proper burial. Then, this dude just peaced out by opening the door and running away."
2 Kings,9,11,"So, Jehu goes up to his lord's servants, right? And one of them asks him, 'Yo, everything cool? Why did this crazy dude come to see you?' And Jehu is like, 'You know the guy and what he's all about.'"
2 Kings,9,12,"So they were like, 'Nah, that can't be true! Spill the beans already!' Then he was like, 'Listen up, fam. This is what he said to me, straight from the man upstairs. The LORD said, 'I've officially crowned you as the king of Israel.'"
2 Kings,9,13,"Then they quickly grabbed their own clothes and placed them under him, on the top of the stairs, and blew on trumpets, shouting, 'Jehu is the king!'}"
2 Kings,9,14,"So this guy named Jehu, who was the son of Jehoshaphat and the grandson of Nimshi, decided to plot against Joram. (Oh, by the way, Joram was the dude who ruled over Ramothgilead with all of Israel because they were worried about Hazael, the king of Syria."
2 Kings,9,15,"So, King Joram went back to Jezreel to get healed from the injuries that the Syrians gave him during his battle with Hazael, the king of Syria. Then Jehu said, 'If you're down with this plan, let no one leave the city to go and spill the tea in Jezreel. No one's escaping, alright?'"
2 Kings,9,16,"Jehu hops in a sick chariot and heads to Jezreel where Joram is chilling. Oh, and by the way, Ahaziah, the king of Judah, came down to visit Joram."
2 Kings,9,17,"There was this dude chilling on the tower in Jezreel, and he spotted Jehu and his homies rolling up. He was like, 'Yo, I see a crew coming through.' Then Joram was like, 'Send a messenger on a horse to check them out and ask if everything's cool.'"
2 Kings,9,18,"So this person on a horse went to meet him and said, like, the king's vibe is like, 'Are we chillin' here?' And Jehu was all like, 'What's peace gotta do with me, man? You can follow me if you want.' And the lookout dude was like, 'Yo, the messenger reached them but he ain't coming back.'"
2 Kings,9,19,"Then he, like, sent another dude on a horse, who rolled up to them and was like, 'Yo, the king says, 'What's up? Is everything chill?' And Jehu was like, 'Why you asking about peace? Ain't got nothin' to do with me, bro. Just follow me.'"
2 Kings,9,20,"So the lookout said, like, 'Yo, he totally came to them, but he ain't coming back - and his driving skills are on another level, just like Jehu, son of Nimshi. He's like on a whole 'nother speed, driving all crazy and wild.'"
2 Kings,9,21,"So Joram was like, 'Get ready!' And his chariot was, like, all set. Then Joram, the king of Israel, and Ahaziah, the king of Judah, both hopped in their chariots and they like, totally went out to confront Jehu. And they actually found him chilling in the land that belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite."
2 Kings,9,22,"So, like, when Joram saw Jehu, he was all like, 'Hey man, everything cool?' And Jehu was like, 'Dude, there's no way anything's cool with all the messed up stuff your mom Jezebel is doing. She's got all these witchcraft things going on, it's not cool at all.'"
2 Kings,9,23,"Joram dipped outta there real quick and was like, 'Yo Ahaziah, something shady's going down, bro.'"
2 Kings,9,24,"So Jehu grabbed a bow and gave it all he had, hitting Jehoram right in the middle of his arms. The arrow went straight through his heart and he collapsed in his chariot."
2 Kings,9,25,"So Jehu told Bidkar, his chief, 'Yo, grab him and throw him into Naboth the Jezreelite's field, 'cause let's not forget, back when me and you were riding with Ahab his pops, the big man upstairs dropped this whole thing on him, you know?'"
2 Kings,9,26,"Yo, I saw with my own eyes yesterday how Naboth and his sons got done dirty, says the LORD. And I ain't gonna let that slide. So, I'm telling you, toss him into that very same plot of land, just like the LORD said. Don't mess with me, I know what's up."
2 Kings,9,27,"But yo, when Ahaziah, the king of Judah, peeped the situation, he dipped through the garden house. And Jehu chased after him like, 'Yo, hit him up in the chariot too.' And they did exactly that when they reached Gur by Ibleam. Ahaziah bounced to Megiddo and met his demise there."
2 Kings,9,28,"And his homies rolled him in a lit whip to Jerusalem, and laid him to rest in his fam's crib in the city of David."
2 Kings,9,29,"And when Joram's kid, Ahaziah, hit his eleventh year on the throne, he started being the ruler of Judah."
2 Kings,9,30,"So, like, Jehu arrived in Jezreel, and Jezebel totally heard about it and decided to do her makeup, style her hair, and show herself off at a window. She went all out with her eye makeup, you know?"
2 Kings,9,31,"So, like, when Jehu walked through the gate, she was like, 'Yo, did Zimri have peace after killing his master?'"
2 Kings,9,32,"And he looked up at the window and asked, 'Who's got my back? Who?' And then two or three of his homies checked it out and looked out for him."
2 Kings,9,33,"And he was like, 'Yo, yeet her down.' So they straight up yeeted her down: and like, some of her blood got all splashed on the wall and the horses too, and he straight up trampled on her."
2 Kings,9,34,"And when he arrived, he ate and drank, and he was like, 'Yo, go check out this woman who's got some bad juju, and give her a proper burial, 'cause she's, like, a royalty.'"
2 Kings,9,35,"So, like, they went to bury her, right? But all they found was, like, the skull, the feet, and, you know, the palms of her hands. Pretty crazy, tbh."
2 Kings,9,36,"So they went back and told him what happened. And he was like, bruh, this is literal words from the LORD that he spoke through his servant Elijah the Tishbite. He straight-up said that in Jezreel, Jezebel's body is gonna get chowed down by some hungry dogs. By the way, that 'by' is just another way of saying 'through.'"
2 Kings,9,37,"And Jezebel's dead body will be like poop on the ground in the land of Jezreel; nobody will even say, 'That's Jezebel!'"
2 Kings,10,1,"So like, Ahab had a whole squad of 70 sons living it up in Samaria. Then Jehu, being the real influencer he is, decided to slide into the DMs of the rulers of Jezreel and the OG elders who raised those Ahab's peeps. He sent them some lit letters, making his intentions known."
2 Kings,10,2,"Yo, once you receive this letter, just know that your boss's sons are with you, and y'all have chariots, horses, a dope city, and armor. Just sayin'."
2 Kings,10,3,"Find the most talented and worthy of your master's sons, and place them on their father's throne, ready to defend your master's house."
2 Kings,10,4,"But they were super scared, like, omg, and were like, okay, two kings couldn't stand against him, so how are we gonna stand up to him?"
2 Kings,10,5,"And the boss man, the city manager, the cool elders, and the child raisers all sent a message to Jehu, saying, 'We've got your back, man. We'll do whatever you ask. We won't crown anyone else as king. Just do what you think is right, bro.'"
2 Kings,10,6,"So he sent another message to them and said, If you're loyal to me and willing to listen to what I say, gather up the heads of your master's sons, and meet me in Jezreel by tomorrow. There were about seventy of the king's sons, hanging out with some important people in the city who raised them."
2 Kings,10,7,"Yo, when they got that letter, they straight up went and took the king's sons and killed seventy peeps. Then, they put their heads in baskets and sent 'em to Jezreel."
2 Kings,10,8,"Yo, so this messenger showed up and was like, 'Yo, check it, they brought the heads of the king's sons.' And he was like, 'Just like, put 'em in two piles at the entrance of the gate till morning, ya know?'"
2 Kings,10,9,"So the next morning, he went out, stood up, and said to everyone, 'Listen up, y'all! Check this out, I totally planned and carried out the removal of my master. But here's the thing, who's responsible for taking down all these people?'"
2 Kings,10,10,"Just so you know, every single thing the LORD said about the house of Ahab will definitely happen. God totally kept His word through His servant Elijah. No doubt about it!"
2 Kings,10,11,"So Jehu totally wiped out everyone from the Ahab fam in Jezreel, including all the big shots, their homies, and their holy peeps, leaving none of 'em alive. {kinsfolks: or, acquaintances}"
2 Kings,10,12,"So he got up and left, heading towards Samaria. While he was on his way, he stopped by a place where shearing was happening, you know, where the shepherds were taking care of their sheep."
2 Kings,10,13,"Jehu ran into the homies of Ahaziah, the king of Judah, and was like, 'Yo, who y'all be?' And they were like, 'We the bros of Ahaziah, just tryna show some love to the royal kids, you know, the king's and queen's children.'"
2 Kings,10,14,"So he was like, 'Capture them, don't let them escape.' And they totally caught them and got rid of all forty-two dudes at the pit near the shearing house. Seriously, not a single one was left."
2 Kings,10,15,"And as he left that place, he came across Jehonadab, Rechab's son, who was coming to meet him. He greeted him and asked if they were on the same wavelength, if their hearts were aligned. Jehonadab replied, 'Absolutely!' If that's the case, give me a sign. So, they shook hands, and he invited Jehonadab to join him in the chariot."
2 Kings,10,16,"And he was like, 'Yo, come chill with me and witness my fire for the LORD.' So they let him roll in his whip."
2 Kings,10,17,"And when he arrived in Samaria, he took down everyone who was left of Ahab's crew, until he wiped them out completely, just like the LORD had said to Elijah."
2 Kings,10,18,"So, Jehu gathered everyone and was like, 'Listen up y'all, Ahab kinda worshiped Baal a bit, but guess what? I'm gonna worship him big time!'"
2 Kings,10,19,"So, like, summon all the prophets, servants, and priests of Baal, like every single one of them. No one should be left out, okay? 'Cause I'm about to make this huge sacrifice to Baal, and anyone who doesn't show up won't, like, survive. But Jehu was super sneaky about it, you know, because he wanted to totally wipe out all those people who worshipped Baal."
2 Kings,10,20,"Jehu was like, 'Yo, let's have a lit gathering for Baal. And they were like, 'Bet, let's make it happen.'"
2 Kings,10,21,"So Jehu sent a message to all of Israel, and all the people who worshipped Baal showed up. Literally, every single person came. They all gathered at the house of Baal, and let me tell you, that place was packed wall to wall. Like, there wasn't even a little breathing space! It was so crowded, they were practically standing with their mouths touching each other. Crazy, right?"
2 Kings,10,22,"Then he told the person in charge of the wardrobe, 'Get some fresh outfits for all the Baal worshippers.' And he did as he was told and brought out the outfits."
2 Kings,10,23,"So Jehu and Jehonadab, Rechab's kid, went to the Baal's crib and told the Baal stans to peep that there's only true Baal followers here, no servants of the LORD allowed."
2 Kings,10,24,"And when they went to make sacrifices and burn offerings, Jehu gathered eighty guys outside and said, 'If any of the dudes I brought to you manages to escape, whoever sets him free will pay with their own life.'"
2 Kings,10,25,"And once he finished making the burnt offering, Jehu told the guard and the captains, 'Go in and take them out - no one should escape!' So they attacked them with swords, and the guard and the captains threw them out before heading to the city where the house of Baal was located."
2 Kings,10,26,So they took those statues from Baal's house and totally yeeted them into the fire.
2 Kings,10,27,"And they totally destroyed the statue of Baal, smashed the entire temple of Baal, and turned it into a freaking public restroom that exists to this day."
2 Kings,10,28,So Jehu totally wiped out Baal from Israel.
2 Kings,10,29,"But Jehu didn't stop following the sins of Jeroboam, the dude who led Israel astray. Specifically, the golden calves in Bethel and Dan, he was all about them."
2 Kings,10,30,"And God was like, 'Yo Jehu, you totally killed it by doing what's right in my eyes and doing exactly what I wanted you to do to Ahab's family. So, your descendants up until the fourth generation will be chilling on the throne of Israel.'"
2 Kings,10,31,"But Jehu didn't really care about following the law of the LORD God of Israel wholeheartedly. He didn't stop himself from committing the same sins as Jeroboam, which led Israel astray."
2 Kings,10,32,"Back in the day, the LORD started reducing Israel's territory. Hazael went all out and attacked them in every part of Israel; 'reducing' here means cutting off their borders."
2 Kings,10,33,"Yo, from the Jordan River going east, the whole land of Gilead belongs to the peeps of Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh. It stretches from Aroer by the Arnon River all the way to Gilead and Bashan. Aroer is on the east side, you know, where the sun comes up."
2 Kings,10,34,"So, like, there's more stuff that Jehu did, and all his crazy power moves, you know? It's all in this book called the chronicles of the kings of Israel, fam. Did you check it out?"
2 Kings,10,35,"And Jehu passed away, and they laid him to rest in Samaria. Then Jehoahaz, his son, became the new ruler."
2 Kings,10,36,"Jehu was in charge of Israel in Samaria for a solid 28 years. It was a good run, no doubt."
2 Kings,11,1,"So, like, when Athaliah, Ahaziah's mom, realized her son had kicked the bucket, she got all triggered and straight-up wiped out the entire royal bloodline. #RIP"
2 Kings,11,2,"Jehosheba, who was king Joram's daughter and Ahaziah's sister, snatched up Joash, Ahaziah's son, and rescued him from among the other royal kids who were killed. She hid him and his nurse in a secret room away from Athaliah, so he wouldn't get killed. (Jehosheba was sometimes called Jehoshabeath, and Joash was also known as Jehoash.)"
2 Kings,11,3,"So, like, he kept it lowkey and stayed at the crib of the LORD for a solid six years. And Athaliah was totally ruling the land, man."
2 Kings,11,4,"In the seventh year, Jehoiada sent for the big shots and the bouncers, and brought them to the crib of the LORD. He made a deal with them, and they swore to him inside the crib of the LORD. Then he introduced them to the king's kid."
2 Kings,11,5,"So he was like, listen up guys, here's what you gotta do: one-third of you that come in on the Sabbath, you'll be in charge of guarding the king's crib, okay?"
2 Kings,11,6,"And one third shall be at the Sur gate, and one third at the guard's gate in the back: this is how you'll maintain the security of the house, preventing any damage or break-ins."
2 Kings,11,7,"And two groups of all of you who go out on the sabbath, they will be in charge of guarding the house of the LORD where the king stays. {groups: or, squads: Hebrew version says 'hands'}"
2 Kings,11,8,"Surround the king, everyone holding weapons, and anyone who gets too close will be taken out. Stay by the king's side as he comes and goes."
2 Kings,11,9,"The squad leaders followed all the orders given by Priest Jehoiada: They gathered their respective crews, including those who were on duty and those who were off duty on Sabbath, and went to meet Priest Jehoiada."
2 Kings,11,10,"The priest gave King David's spears and shields, which were in the temple of the LORD, to the leaders of the hundreds."
2 Kings,11,11,"And the squad was all geared up, each guy holding their weapons, surrounding the king, from one temple corner to the other, covering the whole area near the altar and the temple. (corner: meaning shoulder in Hebrew)"
2 Kings,11,12,"And he brought out the king's son, and placed the crown on his head, and gave him the official documents; and they declared him king, and anointed him; and they cheered and said, Long live the king."
2 Kings,11,13,"When Athaliah heard all the commotion from the guards and the crowd, she went to the temple where the LORD was."
2 Kings,11,14,"And then, like, she saw the king standing by a pillar, just doing his thing, and the important people and the trumpeters were all by the king, and everyone in the land was stoked and started blowing their trumpets. And Athaliah totally freaked out, tore her clothes, and yelled, 'Betrayal, betrayal!'"
2 Kings,11,15,"Yo, Jehoiada the priest straight up told the leaders and soldiers, 'Yo, bring her out of here, no chill, and if anyone tryna stick by her, slash 'em with a sword. The priest don't want her killed up in the Lord's crib.'"
2 Kings,11,16,"And they grabbed her, and she walked along the path that the horses used to enter the king's house, and that's where she got killed."
2 Kings,11,17,"And Jehoiada, like, made this pact between God and the king and the people, ya know? It was like an agreement, bruh, that they would all be God's peeps and stuff. It was all about bringing them together, like uniting the king and the people, ya feel me?"
2 Kings,11,18,"Then everyone in the land went to the crib of Baal and totally wrecked it. They destroyed all his shrines and images, and they even took out Mattan, the priest of Baal, right in front of the shrines. After that, the priest appointed some people to take charge of the gig at the house of the LORD. {officers: like, government peeps appointed by the priest}"
2 Kings,11,19,"So, he gathered all the big shots, the leaders, the guards, and all the people in the land. They brought down the king from the sacred house of the LORD and went through the gate of the guards to the king's palace. And there he sat on the royal throne."
2 Kings,11,20,"And everyone was super hyped, and the whole city was lowkey chill, and they straight up took down Athaliah with a sword right near the king's crib."
2 Kings,11,21,Jehoash was only seven years old when he started ruling the kingdom.
2 Kings,12,1,"In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash took over as king and ruled for forty years in Jerusalem. His mom, Zibiah from Beersheba, held it down."
2 Kings,12,2,Jehoash totally knew what's up and did all the right things according to the LORD as long as Jehoiada the priest was his guide.
2 Kings,12,3,"But, um, they didn't like, get rid of those worship spots, ya know? Like, people were still doing sacrifices and, like, burning incense at those high places."
2 Kings,12,4,"So Jehoash told the priests, all the cash that people bring to the Lord's house as donations, whether it's a specific amount or whatever someone feels like giving, it's all considered holy. Everyone's got a choice in how much they want to give, it's all up to them and what they feel in their hearts."
2 Kings,12,5,The priests are gonna grab their squad and handle it: they'll fix up any spots in the crib that need some fixing.
2 Kings,12,6,"So, like, in the twenty-third year of King Jehoash, the priests totally didn't fix up the damaged parts of the house. It's kinda crazy, right? They just left it broken and stuff. (By the way, the twenty-third year is like the third year too, just so you know.)"
2 Kings,12,7,"So King Jehoash was like, 'Yo, Jehoiada the priest and all the other priests, what's up? Why aren't y'all fixing the broken parts of the house?' He basically told them, 'If you ain't gonna fix it, don't expect no more funds from your homies. Use that money to fix up the house instead.'"
2 Kings,12,8,"So, like, the priests were totally cool with not taking any more cash from the peeps, and they were like, 'Nah, we won't fix up the damages in the crib.'"
2 Kings,12,9,"So Jehoiada, the priest, grabbed a chest and drilled a hole in its lid. He placed the chest next to the altar, on the right side as you walk into the house of the LORD. Then the priests who guarded the entrance put all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD inside the chest."
2 Kings,12,10,"So, like, when they saw that there was a ton of cash in the chest, the king's scribe and the high priest came over. They put the money in bags and counted it out, all the cash they found in the house of the LORD. (By the way, 'scribe' means 'secretary' and 'put up' means 'bound up' in Hebrew.)"
2 Kings,12,11,So they handed over the money to the ones in charge of the construction of the house of the LORD. They gave it to the carpenters and builders who were working on the house of the LORD.
2 Kings,12,12,"And for builders, stoneworkers, and acquiring materials like wood and cut stones to fix up the damaged parts of the house of the LORD, and for all the expenses required to repair it."
2 Kings,12,13,"But the house of the LORD didn't have any sick silver bowls, shiny snuffers, dope basons, lit trumpets, or any gold or silver items bought for cash and brought in."
2 Kings,12,14,"But they gave that to the work crew, and used it to fix up the house of the LORD."
2 Kings,12,15,"And they didn't even bother keeping track of the guys they gave the money to for the work. But hey, those dudes were trustworthy and played it straight."
2 Kings,12,16,"Yo, they didn't bring that trespass money and sin money up in the house of the LORD, that was for the priests, fam."
2 Kings,12,17,"So, like, this dude named Hazael, who was king of Syria, totally went up and fought against Gath, and, get this, he actually conquered it! And then Hazael was all like, 'I'm headed to Jerusalem next!'"
2 Kings,12,18,"So, Jehoash, the king of Judah, gathered up all the sacred stuff that his dads, Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah, had dedicated. He also got his own sacred stuff, plus all the gold that was stashed away in the house of the LORD and the king's house. Then, he sent all that loot to Hazael, the king of Syria, and he bounced from Jerusalem. (He literally went up, yo.)"
2 Kings,12,19,"Yo, you wanna know more about Joash and the cool stuff he did? Check out the book of chronicles of the kings of Judah, bro. It's got all the juicy deets about his life and his dope accomplishments."
2 Kings,12,20,"So, like, his peeps got together and plotted secretly, and then they killed Joash up in Millo, which connects to Silla. {the house...: or, Bethmillo}"
2 Kings,12,21,"Jozachar, son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad, son of Shomer, his homies, straight up took him down and he got finished; they laid him to rest alongside his peeps in the city of David. Then his son Amaziah took over the throne."
2 Kings,13,1,"So, like, when Joash, Ahaziah's son, was king of Judah for 23 years, Jehoahaz, you know, Jehu's son, took over as king of Israel in Samaria and ruled for 17 years."
2 Kings,13,2,"And he, like, totally messed up in the eyes of the LORD, and, like, followed in the wicked footsteps of Jeroboam, Nebat's son, which, like, caused all of Israel to sin; he didn't even try to turn away. (followed: Hebrew for walked after)"
2 Kings,13,3,"God got really ticked off at Israel, so he let Hazael, the king of Syria, and Benhadad (Hazael's son) rule over them for a long time."
2 Kings,13,4,"Jehoahaz reached out to the LORD and the LORD listened to him, because He saw that Israel was dealing with some serious hardship, with the king of Syria really pressing them down."
2 Kings,13,5,"And God hooked up Israel with a hero, so they could finally escape the clutches of the Syrians. And the Israelites went back to chilling in their tents, just like they used to. {as beforetime: Like, it was lit as it was yesterday, and the day before that}"
2 Kings,13,6,"But they didn't stop doing the same messed up stuff as Jeroboam and leading Israel astray. They just kept going down that path, and the shady grove in Samaria was still there too, as a constant reminder."
2 Kings,13,7,"But he only let Jehoahaz keep like, 50 horse riders, 10 chariots, and 10k foot soldiers, 'cause the king of Syria straight up wrecked them and turned them into straight-up dust like how you're threshing wheat."
2 Kings,13,8,"So, like, everything else that Jehoahaz did, all his accomplishments and everything, you can totally find that in the kings of Israel history book, you know?"
2 Kings,13,9,"And Jehoahaz passed away, and they laid him to rest in Samaria. His son, Joash, took over as the new ruler. (Joash was also known as Jehoash.)"
2 Kings,13,10,"In the thirty-seventh year of Joash, the king of Judah, Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, started ruling over Israel in Samaria. He reigned for sixteen years."
2 Kings,13,11,"And he like, totally messed up in God's eyes, didn't even stop doing the same sins as Jeroboam, the dude who caused all of Israel to sin. He was just going along with it, no second thoughts."
2 Kings,13,12,"Yo, there's actually a bunch of other stuff that Joash did, like seriously, it's all written down in this book called the chronicles of the kings of Israel. He showed his strength and straight up fought against Amaziah, who was king of Judah. It's all in there if you wanna check it out!"
2 Kings,13,13,"And Joash passed away, joining his ancestors; while Jeroboam took his place on the throne. They laid Joash to rest in Samaria with the other kings of Israel."
2 Kings,13,14,"So like, Elisha got really sick and unfortunately, he passed away. Then, Joash, the king of Israel, went to see him and started crying, like tears flowing down his face. He was like, 'Oh man, my father, my father, you were like the ultimate ride or die for Israel, leading us to victory like a chariot with its strong horsemen.'"
2 Kings,13,15,"Elisha was like, 'Yo, grab a bow and some arrows.' So, the dude got himself a bow and some arrows."
2 Kings,13,16,"And he was like, yo, king of Israel, put your hand on the bow. So the king was like, bet, and he placed his hand on it. Then Elisha was like, alright, and he put his hands on top of the king's hands. It was a real power move, you know?"
2 Kings,13,17,"Then he was like, 'Yo, open the window towards the east.' So he opened it. Then Elisha was like, 'Aim and shoot!'. And he did. And Elisha was like, 'This arrow represents the LORD's deliverance, and it'll bring deliverance from Syria. You're gonna totally crush the Syrians in Aphek until there's nothing left.'"
2 Kings,13,18,"Then he was like, 'Yo, grab those arrows.' So he grabbed them. And he was all like, 'Hey, king of Israel, beat them arrows on the ground.' So the king, like, hit the ground three times and then stopped."
2 Kings,13,19,"The guy of God got super mad at him and said, 'Dude, you should've hit 'em like five or six times, then you would've totally wrecked Syria until it was gone. But now you're only gonna hit 'em three times, man.'"
2 Kings,13,20,"So, like, Elisha passed away and they gave him a proper burial and everything. But, yo, at the start of the new year, these Moabite gangs straight up invaded the land, can you believe that?"
2 Kings,13,21,"So, there was this one time when some people were burying a dude, right? And then, out of nowhere, they noticed a group of guys nearby. They got a crazy idea and decided to throw the dead guy into the tomb where Elisha's bones were kept. And guess what? As soon as the dead guy touched Elisha's bones, he came back to life and stood up on his feet, like, totally revived and all, you know?"
2 Kings,13,22,"Yo, this dude Hazael, the king of Syria, straight up gave Israel a hard time throughout the entire reign of Jehoahaz."
2 Kings,13,23,"And God was like, totally chill with them, showing mad love and respect, all because of the promise he made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He didn't even think about wiping them out or kicking them out of his squad, like, not even once. {presence: Hebrew word for face}"
2 Kings,13,24,"Hazael, the king of Syria, passed away and his son, Benhadad, took over as the new ruler."
2 Kings,13,25,"So Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, snatched back the cities from Benhadad, Hazael's son, that he had previously taken from Jehoahaz, his father, in a fierce battle. Joash managed to defeat him three times and reclaim the cities of Israel."
2 Kings,14,1,"So, like, right after Joash, Jehoahaz's son, had been king of Israel for two years, Amaziah, who's Joash's son and king of Judah, started to reign."
2 Kings,14,2,He was 25 years old when he started ruling and ruled for 29 years in Jerusalem. His mom's name was Jehoaddan and she was from Jerusalem.
2 Kings,14,3,"And he was, like, totally doing what was right in the eyes of the LORD, but, you know, not exactly like his dad David. He was just following in the footsteps of his dad Joash and doing everything he did."
2 Kings,14,4,"But, like, they didn't even bother to get rid of the high places. People were still sacrificing and burning incense up there, you know?"
2 Kings,14,5,"And like, once he totally got the kingdom under control, he straight up took out his servants who were responsible for killing his own dad, the king."
2 Kings,14,6,"But he didn't kill the children of the murderers, because that goes against what it says in the book of the law of Moses. The LORD commanded that nobody should be put to death for someone else's crimes. Each person should be held accountable for their own wrongdoing."
2 Kings,14,7,"He totally crushed Edom in the valley of salt, like ten thousand gone! Then he straight up conquered Selah, and named it Joktheel, which it's called till now. Oh, and BTW, Selah also means 'the rock' just FYI."
2 Kings,14,8,"So Amaziah DM'd Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, the king of Israel, like, yo dude, let's meet up and have a face-to-face convo."
2 Kings,14,9,"So, like, Jehoash, the king of Israel, hit up Amaziah, the king of Judah, and was all like, 'Yo, bro! So check it, that little dinky thistle in Lebanon messaged the big ol' cedar in Lebanon, asking if his daughter could marry his son. But then, outta nowhere, this wild beast in Lebanon came and totally stomped on that puny thistle.'"
2 Kings,14,10,"You really did destroy Edom, and you're feeling pretty confident about it. Celebrate that victory and stay put at home, okay? There's no need for you to get involved in anything that could end up hurting you and causing both you and Judah to fall. Stay safe and sound in your own crib!"
2 Kings,14,11,"But Amaziah was like, 'Nah, not gonna listen.' So then Jehoash, the king of Israel, decided to go and have a face-off with Amaziah, the king of Judah. They met up at Bethshemesh, which is part of Judah."
2 Kings,14,12,And Judah totally got wrecked by Israel; they dipped out and ran back to their tents.
2 Kings,14,13,"So, Jehoash, the king of Israel, totally captured Amaziah, the king of Judah, who's the son of Jehoash and grandson of Ahaziah, right? It all went down in Bethshemesh. Then, he rolled into Jerusalem and straight up wrecked the wall from the Ephraim gate to the corner gate, like, it was four hundred cubits of pure destruction."
2 Kings,14,14,"So, like, he totally snagged all the sick gold and silver stuff, plus all the cool treasures he found in the house of the LORD and the king's crib. And not gonna lie, he also grabbed some hostages on the way back to Samaria."
2 Kings,14,15,"Yo, check out all the things Jehoash did, yo. He was straight up powerful, and he totally went against Amaziah, the king of Judah. Like, you gotta read all about it in the book that talks about the kings of Israel, y'know?"
2 Kings,14,16,"And Jehoash passed away, and he was laid to rest in Samaria alongside the other kings of Israel. After him, his son Jeroboam became the new ruler."
2 Kings,14,17,"And Amaziah, the son of Joash, the ruler of Judah, survived for fifteen years after the passing of Jehoash, son of Jehoahaz, the ruler of Israel."
2 Kings,14,18,"And, like, if you wanna know more about what Amaziah did, it's all in this like super cool book called the chronicles of the kings of Judah, you know?"
2 Kings,14,19,"So, like, there was this whole plot against him in Jerusalem, and then he had to dip out to Lachish. But, damn, they actually chased after him to Lachish and straight up took him out there."
2 Kings,14,20,"And they carried him on horses, and he was laid to rest in Jerusalem with his ancestors in the city of David."
2 Kings,14,21,"So, like, all the peeps in Judah were like, 'Yo, let's choose Azariah, who was just 16, to be our king after his dad Amaziah.' (BTW, Azariah was also known as Uzziah, ya know?)"
2 Kings,14,22,"He built Elath and gave it back to Judah, after the king passed away."
2 Kings,14,23,"So, like, in the fifteenth year of Amaziah, the son of Joash, who was king of Judah, Jeroboam, the son of Joash, took over as the king of Israel in Samaria. And he ruled for, like, forty-one years."
2 Kings,14,24,"And he totally messed up in front of the LORD: he didn't stop doing all the messed up things that Jeroboam, Nebat's son, did, which made Israel go astray."
2 Kings,14,25,"He made Israel all awesome again, from Hamath to the chillin' plain by the sea, just like the LORD God of Israel said through his homie Jonah, son of Amittai, the legit prophet from Gathhepher."
2 Kings,14,26,"Yo, the big man upstairs peeped the struggle of Israel, like, it was mad intense. No lie, ain't nobody safe, nobody left, and nobody to lend a hand to Israel."
2 Kings,14,27,"And God didn't even mention wiping out Israel from existence. Instead, he rescued them with the help of Jeroboam, the son of Joash."
2 Kings,14,28,"So, like, there's more stuff that Jeroboam did, and it was legit impressive. He straight up took over Damascus and Hamath, which were originally part of Judah but became part of Israel. You can find all the deets written in the book that's all about the kings of Israel, yo."
2 Kings,14,29,"And Jeroboam passed away, joining his ancestors, the kings of Israel. Then his son Zachariah took over as the new ruler."
2 Kings,15,1,"In the 27th year of Jeroboam's rule as king of Israel, Azariah (aka Uzziah) son of Amaziah became the boss of Judah."
2 Kings,15,2,"He was just 16 when he became king, and he ruled over Jerusalem for a solid 52 years. His mom, Jecholiah from Jerusalem, had his back."
2 Kings,15,3,"And he did what was lit in God's eyes, just like his OG dad Amaziah."
2 Kings,15,4,But they didn't get rid of the high spots tho: peeps kept sacrificing and burning incense up there like before.
2 Kings,15,5,"And God messed up the king so bad that he got leprosy until he died and had to live in a separate house. And Jotham, the king's son, took charge and started making fair decisions for the people of the land."
2 Kings,15,6,"And yo, all the other stuff Azariah did, like, isn't it all written in that book called 'Chronicles of the Kings of Judah' or something?"
2 Kings,15,7,"So Azariah passed away and was laid to rest with his ancestors in the city of David. Jotham, his son, took over as ruler in his place."
2 Kings,15,8,"In the 38th year that Azariah was ruling Judah, Zachariah, son of Jeroboam, stepped up to take charge of Israel in Samaria, but only lasted for a short six months."
2 Kings,15,9,"And, like his dads before him, he totally messed up in God's eyes. He didn't even try to stop committing the same sins as Jeroboam, the guy who messed up Israel."
2 Kings,15,10,"Then Shallum, Jabesh's son, plotted against him and attacked him in front of everyone. He killed him and took over his position as ruler."
2 Kings,15,11,"So, basically, if you want to know more about what went down with Zachariah, you gotta check out the book called 'The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel'. It's got all the juicy details you're looking for!"
2 Kings,15,12,This is what God told Jehu: Your kids will rule over Israel for four generations. And guess what? It totally happened.
2 Kings,15,13,"Shallum, Jabesh's son, took over as king when Uzziah of Judah had been ruling for 39 years. Shallum held the throne in Samaria for a solid month."
2 Kings,15,14,"So Menahem, Gadi's son, left Tirzah and went to Samaria. He defeated and killed Shallum, Jabesh's son, in Samaria, taking over as ruler."
2 Kings,15,15,"So, like, all the other stuff that Shallum pulled off, with his whole scheming thing, it's, like, totally recorded in that book of stories about the kings of Israel, you know?"
2 Kings,15,16,"So, Menahem totally wrecked Tiphsah and everyone there, along with the surrounding areas from Tirzah. Why, you ask? Well, they refused to let him in, so he's like, 'Fine, I'm gonna take 'em down!' And not only that, he even went as far as to harm all the pregnant women in there. Yeah, pretty brutal, I know."
2 Kings,15,17,"In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah ruling over Judah, Menahem, Gadi's son, took charge of Israel and was king in Samaria for a solid decade."
2 Kings,15,18,"And he, like, totally messed up in the eyes of the LORD, ya know? He never stopped committing the same old sins as Jeroboam, who got all of Israel into sinning mode."
2 Kings,15,19,"So there was this king named Pul from Assyria who rolled up on our turf. And Menahem, being the smart guy he is, gave Pul a ton of cash - like a thousand talents of silver, no biggie - so they could be bros and Pul could help Menahem secure his kingdom. #FriendshipGoals"
2 Kings,15,20,"Menahem collected money from all the rich and powerful people in Israel, making each person give fifty shekels of silver to the king of Assyria. As a result, the king of Assyria went back and didn't stay in the land anymore."
2 Kings,15,21,"Yo, are all the other dope things Menahem did not mentioned in the sick book of the kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,15,22,"And Menahem passed away, and his son Pekahiah took over as king."
2 Kings,15,23,"In the 50th year of Azariah ruling over Judah, Pekahiah, Menahem's son, started being in charge of Israel in Samaria, and he ruled for two years."
2 Kings,15,24,"And he did some really messed up stuff that made God really, really angry. He just couldn't stop being sinful, just like Jeroboam, who taught Israel to do all kinds of bad things."
2 Kings,15,25,"Yo, so Pekah, the son of Remaliah, one of his top dudes, straight up plotted against him and took him down in Samaria, right in the crib of the king's pad. He had Argob, Arieh, and fifty other Gileadites roll with him, and they straight up killed him. Then Pekah took over and ruled in his place, no cap."
2 Kings,15,26,"So, like, there's more stuff about Pekahiah and everything he did, you know? It's all written down in the book that tells the stories of the kings of Israel, yo."
2 Kings,15,27,"So, like, in the 52nd year of Azariah, the king of Judah, this dude Pekah, son of Remaliah, totally started ruling over Israel in Samaria. He held onto that power for twenty whole years, man."
2 Kings,15,28,"And like, he totally did things that were not cool in the eyes of the LORD, ya know? He was all about keeping up those sinful ways of Jeroboam, Nebat's son, who led Israel astray."
2 Kings,15,29,"Back in the day when Pekah was ruling Israel, Tiglathpileser, the king of Assyria, rolled in and straight up snatched Ijon, Abelbethmaachah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, Galilee, basically all of Naphtali's turf, and dragged them off as captives to Assyria."
2 Kings,15,30,"So Hoshea, Elah's son, plotted against Pekah, Remaliah's son, and totally took him out, becoming the new ruler instead in the year Jotham, Uzziah's son, turned twenty."
2 Kings,15,31,"Yo, there's more to Pekah's story, like all the stuff he did, but you gotta check out the book of the kings of Israel for all the deets."
2 Kings,15,32,"In the second year when Pekah, Remaliah's son, was ruling over Israel, Jotham, Uzziah's son, took the crown as king of Judah."
2 Kings,15,33,"He became king when he was 25 years old and ruled Jerusalem for 16 years. His mom's name was Jerusha, and she was Zadok's daughter."
2 Kings,15,34,"Dude, he totally did what was righteous in the eyes of the LORD. Like, he followed in the footsteps of his father Uzziah and did everything just like him."
2 Kings,15,35,"But, like, even though they knew they shouldn't, the people kept doing their thing at the high places, you know? They were sacrificing and burning incense there, totally ignoring the rules. Oh, and just to add, dude also built this super cool gate, like, way higher up, at the house of the LORD. Pretty impressive, fam."
2 Kings,15,36,"Yo, if you wanna know more about Jotham and everything he did, just check out the chronicles of the kings of Judah. It's all written down there, fam."
2 Kings,15,37,"Back in the day, the LORD decided to bring some trouble to Judah by sending Rezin, the king of Syria, and Pekah, son of Remaliah."
2 Kings,15,38,"And Jotham passed away and was laid to rest in the city of David, alongside his ancestors. Afterward, his son Ahaz took over as the ruler."
2 Kings,16,1,"In like the 17th year of Pekah, Remaliah's kid, Ahaz - Jotham's offspring - took over as king of Judah."
2 Kings,16,2,"Ahaz was, like, totally 20 when he became king and ruled for 16 years in Jerusalem. But, like, he didn't do what God wanted him to do, you know? He didn't follow God's rules, just like his dad David did."
2 Kings,16,3,"But he totally followed the kings of Israel and even made his son go through some messed up rituals, like the disgusting stuff the other nations were into, and God was like, 'Nah, I'm kicking them out of Israel.'"
2 Kings,16,4,"And he was like, totally offering sacrifices and burning incense everywhere, on like high places, hills, and even under each and every green tree!"
2 Kings,16,5,"So, Rezin, the king of Syria, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, the king of Israel, decided to attack Jerusalem, but they couldn't defeat Ahaz, even though they had surrounded the city."
2 Kings,16,6,"Back in the day, Rezin, the king of Syria, took back Elath and kicked out the Jews. The Syrians moved in and still live there to this day. {from Elath: in Hebrew, from Eloth}"
2 Kings,16,7,"So Ahaz hit up Tiglathpileser, the king of Assyria, with a DM like, 'Hey, I'm totally down to be your loyal follower and homie. Can you slide through and save me from these haters? The kings of Syria and Israel are all up in my face.'"
2 Kings,16,8,So Ahaz straight up took the cash from both the Lord's crib and the king's stash and sent it as a gift to the king of Assyria.
2 Kings,16,9,"So the king of Assyria listened to him and went up against Damascus, captured it, took its people to Kir as captives, and killed Rezin. (Damascus was also known as Dammesek)"
2 Kings,16,10,"So King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser, the king of Assyria, and he noticed an altar in Damascus. King Ahaz then sent a message to Urijah the priest, describing the design and all the details of the altar."
2 Kings,16,11,"So this priest named Urijah totally built an altar, just like King Ahaz had instructed him all the way from Damascus, you know? And Urijah, being the priest that he is, set up the altar before King Ahaz even arrived from Damascus."
2 Kings,16,12,"And when the king got back from Damascus, he noticed the altar. So, he went up to it and made an offering there."
2 Kings,16,13,"And he lit up his burnt offering and his food offering, and poured out his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar. {the peace offerings which were his: in Hebrew, the peace offerings that belonged to him}"
2 Kings,16,14,"So he moved the bronze altar that was in front of the LORD, from the very front of the temple, between the altar and the house of the LORD, and placed it on the north side of the altar."
2 Kings,16,15,"Yo, King Ahaz told Urijah the priest to go ahead and burn the morning burnt offering, the evening meat offering, the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering on the huge altar. Oh, and don't forget to include the burnt offerings, meat offerings, and drink offerings from all the people in the land. Then, sprinkle all the blood from the burnt offering and sacrifice on that brass altar. By the way, that altar is solely for my needs and inquiries."
2 Kings,16,16,So Urijah the priest did everything that king Ahaz commanded him to do.
2 Kings,16,17,"Yo, King Ahaz straight up removed the edges of these bases and took away the water basin from them. He also took down the huge sea thing from the bronze oxen underneath it, and placed it on a stone floor."
2 Kings,16,18,"So, the chill hangout spot they made in the house for the Sabbath, and the cool outdoor entrance for the king, he decided to get rid of because of the king of Assyria."
2 Kings,16,19,"So, like, all the other stuff that Ahaz did, isn't it all, like, written down in that book called 'The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah' or what?"
2 Kings,16,20,"And Ahaz passed away, joining his ancestors, and was laid to rest in the city of David. Then Hezekiah, his son, took his place as the new ruler."
2 Kings,17,1,"So, like, in the twelfth year of Ahaz's reign as king of Judah, this dude named Hoshea, Elah's son, started being the ruler of Israel in Samaria. He held the position for, like, nine years, you know?"
2 Kings,17,2,"And he, like, totally did things that were so not cool in the eyes of the LORD, but hey, he wasn't as bad as the previous kings of Israel, you know?"
2 Kings,17,3,"Then Shalmaneser, the king of Assyria, came against him, and Hoshea became his servant and gave him some gifts. (The word 'gave' means 'rendered' here and 'presents' can also mean 'tribute'.)"
2 Kings,17,4,"So, like, the king of Assyria totally caught Hoshea trying to plot against him. Turns out, Hoshea had sent messengers to this So dude, king of Egypt, without bringing any gifts to the king of Assyria, like he used to do every year. That's why the king of Assyria was like, 'Nah, no way!' and he locked Hoshea up in prison. #toughluck"
2 Kings,17,5,"So like, the king of Assyria rolled through the whole land and headed to Samaria, and he straight up surrounded it for three years."
2 Kings,17,6,"In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria totally clapped Samaria and flexed on Israel by dragging them to Assyria. He yeeted them to places like Halah and Habor by the river of Gozan, as well as the cities of the Medes."
2 Kings,17,7,"Yo, it went down like this: the Israelites straight up messed up and got on the wrong side of the LORD, their God, who hooked them up by getting them out of Egypt, breaking free from Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and suddenly they were all about worshipping other gods and stuff."
2 Kings,17,8,"And they started following the same rules as those non-believers that God kicked out before the Israelites, and the rules set by the kings of Israel that they themselves created."
2 Kings,17,9,"So the Israelites started doing some shady stuff that totally wasn't cool with the LORD their God. They straight up built these fancy spots in all their cities, from the lookout tower to the fortified city walls."
2 Kings,17,10,"And they, like, totally put up these statues and groves on every high hill and under every cool tree, you know. #artistry #nature"
2 Kings,17,11,"And they were burning incense at all the cool spots, just like those non-believers that the LORD sent away earlier, and doing all kinds of messed up stuff to make the LORD really mad:"
2 Kings,17,12,"They were all about worshipping idols, even though the LORD had straight up told them not to do that."
2 Kings,17,13,"But God totally called out Israel and Judah through all the prophets and seers. He was like, 'Yo, stop doing messed up stuff and start following my rules and laws, just like your ancestors did. I sent you messages through my prophet squad, so you better listen up.'"
2 Kings,17,14,"But they were stubborn and refused to listen, just like their ancestors who didn't trust in the LORD their God."
2 Kings,17,15,"But they totally dissed his rules and the agreement he made with their ancestors, and even ignored all his warnings. Instead, they started chasing after useless things and ended up being totally empty. They ditched their own God and started imitating the people around them, even though God had specifically told them not to."
2 Kings,17,16,"And, like, they totally ditched all the rules from the LORD their God and decided to make these, like, trendy metal statues, you know, two calves. Oh, and they also made this chill hangout spot in the woods and started worshiping all the cool celestial beings and serving this dude named Baal."
2 Kings,17,17,"They like, totally made their kids go through fire, and got all into divination and enchantments, and like, straight up sold themselves out to do bad stuff that made the LORD hella mad."
2 Kings,17,18,"So, like, the LORD was seriously ticked off at Israel, and totally banished them from his presence. It was like, only the tribe of Judah that survived, y'know?"
2 Kings,17,19,"So, like, Judah totally didn't follow the commandments of the LORD their God. They were all about doing their own thing and going along with the rules that the people of Israel made for themselves."
2 Kings,17,20,"Yo, the LORD straight up rejected all the descendants of Israel. He gave them a tough time, let them face some real spoilers, until he straight up pushed them out of his sight."
2 Kings,17,21,"Because he split Israel away from David's dynasty; and they made Jeroboam, Nebat's son, their king: and Jeroboam led Israel astray from following the LORD, causing them to commit a major sin."
2 Kings,17,22,"The Israelite squad really went all in on the sinful actions of Jeroboam, like no turning back, totally sticking with it."
2 Kings,17,23,"So, like, the LORD followed through on what He said through all the prophets and stuff and made Israel peace out of His sight. And now, Israel got deported from their homeland to Assyria, and it's been like that up until now."
2 Kings,17,24,"So, the Assyrian king brought in some peeps from Babylon, Cuthah, Ava, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and settled them in the cities of Samaria, kicking out the Israelite kids. They took over Samaria and made it their new crib."
2 Kings,17,25,"So, like, when they first started living there, they totally didn't respect the LORD, you know? So, the LORD decided to send a bunch of lions to attack them, and, like, some people got killed and stuff."
2 Kings,17,26,"So, they went up to the Assyrian king and were like, 'Yo, the peeps you relocated to the cities of Samaria don't know squat about the God of the land. That's why there are lions attacking and straight up wrecking them, 'cause they don't know how to act around the God of the land."
2 Kings,17,27,"So the ruler of Assyria was like, 'Yo, grab one of those priests you took from there and send them over to live there and teach the people about how the God of that land rolls.'"
2 Kings,17,28,"So, like, this priest that got taken from Samaria ended up chilling in Bethel, and he's, like, teaching the people there how to respect the LORD, you know?"
2 Kings,17,29,"But like, every nation was like, into making their own gods, you know? And they would totally place them in these fancy high places that the Samaritans built, like in every city where they lived."
2 Kings,17,30,"So, like, the guys from Babylon were all about this thing called Succothbenoth, and the dudes from Cuth were into Nergal, and the guys from Hamath were all about Ashima."
2 Kings,17,31,"So, the Avites were totally into creating Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites took things to a whole new level by literally sacrificing their own children in a fiery blaze to worship Adrammelech and Anammelech, who they believed were the supreme gods of Sepharvaim."
2 Kings,17,32,"So like, they were totally in awe of the LORD, and then they went and chose some random peeps from the bottom of the barrel to be their priests at the fancy worship spots. These priests were the ones sacrificing for them in those bougie high-rise houses of worship."
2 Kings,17,33,"They were shook by the LORD, but also did their own thing by following the trends of the nations they were taken captive by. {who carried them away from thence}"
2 Kings,17,34,"Even until now, they still do things the old-fashioned way. They don't really care about God, and they don't follow the rules, regulations, laws, and commandments that God gave to the people of Jacob, also known as Israel."
2 Kings,17,35,"God made a deal with these people and told them, 'Don't be scared of other gods, don't bow down to them, don't be their servants, and definitely don't offer sacrifices to them.'"
2 Kings,17,36,"But the LORD, who flexed His immense power and rescued you from Egypt, is the one you should respect, worship, and make offerings to."
2 Kings,17,37,"So, like, all those rules, guidelines, laws, and commands that he put down for you? Yeah, you gotta follow them forever, and definitely don't start worshiping any other gods, okay?"
2 Kings,17,38,"Yo, don't forget about the deal I made with you and don't be trippin' over other gods."
2 Kings,17,39,"You gotta have mad respect for the LORD your God, 'cause He'll straight up save you from all your enemies."
2 Kings,17,40,"But they didn't listen, they just kept doing what they always did."
2 Kings,17,41,"So like, these nations legit had like, mad respect for God and stuff, but they also worshipped these whack statues and passed down this whole messed up worship thing to their kids and grandkids. It's like a tradition that's still going on today, just like their ancestors used to do. Man, talk about stuck in the past."
2 Kings,18,1,"In the year three of Hoshea, son of Elah, reigning as king of Israel, Hezekiah, son of Ahaz, took over as the ruler of Judah. You may also know Hezekiah as Ezekias."
2 Kings,18,2,"He was 25 years old when he started being in charge, and he ruled over Jerusalem for 29 years. His mom's name was Abi, and she was the daughter of Zachariah. (Abi was also known as Abijah!)"
2 Kings,18,3,"And he did what was lit in God's eyes, just like how his dad David did it."
2 Kings,18,4,"He totally got rid of all the cool spots where people were worshiping idols, smashed all the statues, chopped down those nature shrines, and completely destroyed that bronze snake Moses had made. You won't believe it, but back then, the Israelites used to light incense and worship it like it was some kind of divine object. He even gave it a mocking name - Nehushtan, which basically means a useless piece of metal."
2 Kings,18,5,"He had mad trust in the LORD God of Israel; like, no cap, no other king in Judah could even come close to him, not even the ones before him."
2 Kings,18,6,Because he stayed loyal to the LORD and never stopped following Him. He made it a point to obey all the commandments that the LORD gave to Moses.
2 Kings,18,7,"And God was always there for him; he succeeded wherever he went, and he refused to obey the king of Assyria and didn't serve him."
2 Kings,18,8,"He totally owned the Philistines, like all the way to Gaza, and their whole territory, from the watchtower to the fortified city. (Gaza means Azzah in Hebrew, by the way)"
2 Kings,18,9,"So, like, in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was in the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah, who was king of Israel, Shalmaneser, who was the king of Assyria, came and attacked Samaria, putting it under siege."
2 Kings,18,10,"After three years, they finally conquered it - in the sixth year of Hezekiah's reign, which was also the ninth year of Hoshea's rule over Israel. That's when Samaria fell."
2 Kings,18,11,"So like, the king of Assyria took the whole nation of Israel to Assyria and made them live in places called Halah and Habor, which are like near the Gozan river, you know? And there were also some Israelites living in the cities of the Medes, FYI."
2 Kings,18,12,"Yo, they straight up didn't listen to the voice of the LORD, didn't keep His covenant, and totally ignored all the commands of Moses, who was like God's right-hand man. They just couldn't be bothered to listen or follow through."
2 Kings,18,13,"So like, in the 14th year that King Hezekiah was ruling, this dude named Sennacherib, who was the king of Assyria, decided to attack all the fortified cities of Judah and actually managed to conquer them. (Sennacherib means Sanherib in Hebrew, just FYI!)"
2 Kings,18,14,"So Hezekiah, the king of Judah, reached out to the king of Assyria in Lachish and humbly admitted his wrongdoing. He asked the king to forgive him and promised to take responsibility for any consequences. In response, the king of Assyria demanded from Hezekiah a hefty amount of silver - three hundred talents - and gold - thirty talents."
2 Kings,18,15,So Hezekiah hooked him up with all the cash he found in the crib of the LORD and the king's stash.
2 Kings,18,16,"Back then, Hezekiah straight up took the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and the ones he used to fancy up the pillars, and handed it all over to the king of Assyria. Can you believe it?"
2 Kings,18,17,"So, like, the king of Assyria, he like totally sent Tartan, Rabsaris, and Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah with this massive army, you know? And they like went all the way to Jerusalem, and once they got there, they stood by the conduit of the upper pool, the one that's located on the highway of the fuller's field. It's, like, a major deal, you know?!"
2 Kings,18,18,"So they called for the king, and Eliakim, Hilkiah's son who was in charge of the household, along with Shebna the scribe and Joah, Asaph's son, who was the recorder, came out to meet them."
2 Kings,18,19,"So Rabshakeh was like, 'Yo, talk to Hezekiah and tell him this: The big shot king of Assyria wants to know what gives him so much confidence.'"
2 Kings,18,20,You're just talking nonsense when you say you have a plan and power for the battle. Who do you think you can rely on that you're rebelling against me?
2 Kings,18,21,"Yo, check it out, you're relying on a weak af stick - Egypt, bro. If you lean on it, it's gonna break and stab you. That's exactly what Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, is like for anyone who puts their trust in him. #notworthit #unreliable"
2 Kings,18,22,"But like, if you're telling me, 'Yo, we're all about trusting in the LORD our God,' isn't it true that Hezekiah straight up got rid of those fancy worship spots and altars? And now he's saying that we gotta worship at this altar in Jerusalem?"
2 Kings,18,23,"Okay, listen up. Here's the deal: Get ready, 'cause I'm about to offer you a sweet deal. Just give some guarantees to my main man, the king of Assyria, and in return, I'll hook you up with two thousand horses. Of course, you gotta prove you can handle them by actually putting riders on 'em. Deal or no deal?"
2 Kings,18,24,"Like, how do you plan to impress even the lowest-ranking officer of my master, and rely on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?"
2 Kings,18,25,"Did I just roll up here without the LORD to wreck this place? The LORD straight up told me, 'Yo, go and take down this land.'"
2 Kings,18,26,"So Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, Shebna, and Joah said to Rabshakeh, 'Dude, could you, like, speak in Syrian so that we can actually understand you? Don't use Hebrew to talk to us in front of these peeps on the wall.'"
2 Kings,18,27,"Yo, Rabshakeh was like, did my boss send me to your boss and you just to say this? Nah, he sent me to the dudes chillin' on the wall, so they can munch on their own crap and chug their own pee with you. Yeah, you heard me right, their own pee aka the water they wash their feet with."
2 Kings,18,28,"So, like, Rabshakeh straight up stood there and started shouting in the Jews' language, and he was like, 'Listen up, ya'll! Get ready to hear the word from the real deal great king, the king of Assyria!'"
2 Kings,18,29,"Listen up, fam! The king says, don't be fooled by Hezekiah. He won't be able to save you from his grasp."
2 Kings,18,30,"Don't let Hezekiah talk you into putting all your faith in the LORD, claiming that the LORD will totally save us and that this city won't fall into the hands of the king of Assyria."
2 Kings,18,31,"Don't listen to Hezekiah, 'cause this is what the king of Assyria says: hang out with me, bring some cool stuff, and then we can all enjoy our own fruit and drink water from our own fancy wells. Let's make it all good, my peeps!"
2 Kings,18,32,"Yo, listen up! I got some good news for y'all. Imma come through and bring you to a dope land, just like where you from. It's gonna have all the good stuff - corn and wine, bread and vineyards, olive oil and honey. You'll be livin' it up, no dying allowed. Oh, and don't fall for Hezekiah tryna convince you that the LORD gonna save us. Don't believe the hype. Trust me on this one!"
2 Kings,18,33,Have any of the gods of other nations actually saved their land from the king of Assyria?
2 Kings,18,34,"Yo, what happened to the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are those gods from Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? Did they save Samaria from my power?"
2 Kings,18,35,"Like, seriously, which of those so-called gods of other nations even stand a chance? Like, have any of them ever saved their people from me? So, why should the LORD save Jerusalem from me?"
2 Kings,18,36,"But the people were all like, totally silent and didn't say anything to him. 'Cause the king was all like, 'Don't answer him, fam.'"
2 Kings,18,37,"So, Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, who was in charge of the household, along with Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder, went to Hezekiah. They were wearing torn clothes and shared the words of Rabshakeh with him."
2 Kings,19,1,"So, when King Hezekiah heard about it, he was totally devastated. He freaked out, tore his clothes, threw on some humble sackcloth, and headed straight to the house of the LORD."
2 Kings,19,2,"So he picked Eliakim, who was in charge, and Shebna the scribe, and the older priests, all wearing sackcloth, to go see Isaiah the prophet, Amoz's son."
2 Kings,19,3,"And they were like, yo Hezekiah, listen up, today is straight up rough. We're dealing with troubles, criticism, and straight up disrespect. It's like giving birth, but lacking the strength to actually bring it forth. It's legit provoking, man."
2 Kings,19,4,"God might just listen to what that guy Rabshakeh is saying, you know, the one the Assyrian king sent to disrespect the one true God. And when God hears it, He'll definitely call him out on it. So, you better pray for the few who are still hanging on. (Remnant means like, those who were found or something.)"
2 Kings,19,5,So King Hezekiah's squad rolled up to Isaiah's crib.
2 Kings,19,6,"Isaiah was like, yo guys, here's what you gotta tell your boss: listen up, the Lord says, don't freak out about all the trash talk you heard from those Assyrian king's servants dissing me."
2 Kings,19,7,"Yo, listen up! I'm about to send a major attack his way, and he's gonna catch wind of some juicy gossip that'll make him turn right back to where he came from. And you know what? I'm gonna make sure he gets taken down in his own turf, beaten by the sword."
2 Kings,19,8,"So Rabshakeh went back and saw that the king of Assyria was battling against Libnah, because he heard that the king had left Lachish."
2 Kings,19,9,"So, when he heard that Tirhakah, the king of Ethiopia, was coming to fight against you, he sent messengers to Hezekiah once again, like,"
2 Kings,19,10,"Yo, tell Hezekiah, the king of Judah, that he shouldn't let his trust in God fool him into thinking that Jerusalem won't be handed over to the king of Assyria."
2 Kings,19,11,"Listen up, you've seen how the kings of Assyria straight up wrecked all those lands. Think you're gonna be spared?"
2 Kings,19,12,"Did those gods of other nations even save them from being annihilated as my ancestors annihilated cities like Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden in Thelasar?"
2 Kings,19,13,"Yo, what happened to the kings of Hamath, Arpad, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah tho?"
2 Kings,19,14,So Hezekiah got the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went into the house of the LORD and laid it out in front of Him.
2 Kings,19,15,"And Hezekiah was like, yo God, the only one and true God of Israel, who's chilling between the cherubims, you're the absolute boss, no one else compares, ruling all the kingdoms on this earth. You're the one who created the whole heaven and earth."
2 Kings,19,16,"Yo, God, like, listen up and pay attention: open your eyes and witness what Sennacherib is saying to dishonor you, the mighty living God."
2 Kings,19,17,"For real, God, the kings of Assyria straight up wrecked the nations and their lands,"
2 Kings,19,18,"And they totally yeeted their fake gods into the fire, 'cause let's be real, those things were just made by some dudes using basic materials like wood and stone. So obvi they totally wrecked them."
2 Kings,19,19,"Yo, God, listen up! I'm begging you, please rescue us from this guy's clutches, so that all the kingdoms on Earth can recognize that you're the one and only LORD God."
2 Kings,19,20,"So Isaiah, son of Amoz, hit up Hezekiah with a message from the LORD God of Israel. The deal is, He heard your prayer about Sennacherib, the king of Assyria."
2 Kings,19,21,"Yo, this is what the LORD said about this dude: The virgin, daughter of Zion, straight up dissed you and laughed at you; the daughter of Jerusalem even shook her head in disappointment."
2 Kings,19,22,"Who have you dissed and disrespected? And who have you mocked and talked trash about? Against whom have you tried so hard to be loud and tried to act all high and mighty? Yep, against the Holy One of Israel."
2 Kings,19,23,"You really dissed the Lord with your messengers, boasting about how your fleet of fancy chariots conquered mountains and chopped down all those majestic cedar and fir trees. You even bragged about invading the borders and infiltrating the lush forest. #BoldMoves #NatureConqueror"
2 Kings,19,24,"I've explored and sipped on some seriously bizarre drinks, and I've totally drained all the rivers in heavily protected areas with the soles of my shoes. {besieged: or, fenced}"
2 Kings,19,25,"Yo, didn't you know way back when I totally did this? Like, I've been planning and setting it up since ancient times. And now, watch me make it happen: those fortified cities are gonna crumble into total ruins. Bet you didn't see that coming, huh?"
2 Kings,19,26,"So like, the people living there were pretty weak and totally freaked out. They were like, so fragile and easily crushed, just like grass in a field or green plants on a rooftop. It's like they couldn't even grow up properly, getting destroyed just as they started. They seriously lacked power and strength."
2 Kings,19,27,"But I know where you chill, where you roll out, where you show up, and how you get all mad at me. #notsosecret"
2 Kings,19,28,"Since you're out here getting all mad and causing a scene, I heard it loud and clear. So guess what? I'm gonna put a little something in your nose and a bit in your mouth to control ya. And you know what else? I'm gonna make you go back the same way you came from. Bam!"
2 Kings,19,29,"And here's how you know: You gotta feast on the self-grown goods this year, then the next year munch on what's sprouting up naturally. But in the third year, you gotta put efforts into planting, harvesting, and growing vineyards, and indulge in the sweet fruits of your labor."
2 Kings,19,30,"Yo, the small crew that managed to survive from the house of Judah will get their roots deep down and start producing mad fruit in no time. #Survivors #Growth"
2 Kings,19,31,"Yo, listen up! There will be a group of peeps coming outta Jerusalem, and some survivors from Mount Zion too. It's all gonna go down because the Lord is super pumped about it. Trust me, it's gonna happen!"
2 Kings,19,32,"So basically, God's saying that the king of Assyria ain't gonna get anywhere near this city. Like, no chance. He won't even shoot an arrow at it, or show up with his shield, or try to set up camp. This city is off-limits to him, no doubt."
2 Kings,19,33,"Just like the way he rolled in, that's how he gonna roll back out. Ain't gonna step foot in this city, says the LORD."
2 Kings,19,34,"I got your back, fam! Gonna protect this city, just to save it. Doing it for my own sake and for the sake of my homeboy, David."
2 Kings,19,35,"So, like, during the night, the angel of the LORD went out and totally wrecked the Assyrians in their camp, wiping out like 185,000 of them! And when morning came, bam, there was just a bunch of dead bodies lying around."
2 Kings,19,36,"And like, Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, just bounced, went back to his crib in Nineveh."
2 Kings,19,37,"So, while he was busy vibing and worshipping in the house of his god Nisroch, Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons, straight up attacked him with a sword. Then, they dipped and escaped to Armenia. And yo, his son Esarhaddon took over as the new ruler. (Ararat, you know, that's what Armenia used to be called, just a lil' FYI)"
2 Kings,20,1,"Back in those days, Hezekiah was seriously ill, almost on the verge of death. Then Isaiah, the prophet and son of Amoz, paid him a visit. Isaiah straight up told him, 'Yo, the Big Man upstairs has a message for you: Get your house in order because you're about to kick the bucket.'"
2 Kings,20,2,"So he whipped out his phone, flipped the camera to selfie mode, and DM'd the LORD, like,"
2 Kings,20,3,"Yo, God, please remember how I've been real and genuine in my actions, staying true to my heart and doing what's right in your eyes. Hezekiah straight up cried his heart out, like, a lot."
2 Kings,20,4,"So, like, Isaiah hadn't even left the middle court yet, when the word of the LORD came to him, saying..."
2 Kings,20,5,"Get back to Hezekiah, the leader of my peeps, and tell him this from the LORD, the God of his pops David: I listened to your prayer, I saw those tears drop. Check it, I'm gonna bring the healing your way, and in just three days, you'll bounce back and head over to the crib of the LORD."
2 Kings,20,6,"I'm gonna hook you up with 15 more years, save you and this city from the Assyrian king, and protect this place for myself and because of my homeboy David."
2 Kings,20,7,"So Isaiah was like, 'Yo, grab those figs.' And they did, and put it on the boil, and the dude got better."
2 Kings,20,8,"And Hezekiah was like, yo Isaiah, can you gimme a sign that the LORD is gonna heal me? Like, I wanna know if I'll be able to go to the house of the LORD in three days or not."
2 Kings,20,9,"So Isaiah was like, yo, here's how you'll know that the Lord is gonna do what He said: basically, you can choose if the shadow moves forward ten degrees or goes back ten degrees."
2 Kings,20,10,"And Hezekiah was like, bruh, it ain't no big deal if the shadow goes down ten degrees, nah fam, but how about we make it go back ten degrees instead?"
2 Kings,20,11,"So Isaiah the prophet called out to the LORD and, like, the LORD made the shadow go back ten degrees on the dial of Ahaz, you know. (BTW, the Hebrew word for 'dial' means 'degrees'.)"
2 Kings,20,12,"Back in the day, Berodachbaladan, Baladan's son and the king of Babylon, slid into Hezekiah's DMs with a message and a gift. He heard that Hezekiah was dealing with some sickness. (BTW, Berodachbaladan is also known as Merodachbaladan.)"
2 Kings,20,13,"And Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them everything cool in his crib - the bling, the gold, the fragrances, the fancy perfume, and all the lit gear he had in his stash. He didn't hold back, showing them everything in his crib and his entire kingdom. Hezekiah flexed hard, making sure they saw every single thing he had. No cap!"
2 Kings,20,14,"So Isaiah the prophet showed up to King Hezekiah and asked him, 'Yo, what did those dudes say and where did they come from?' And Hezekiah was like, 'They came all the way from Babylon, man.'"
2 Kings,20,15,"And he was like, 'Dude, what did those people see in your house?' And Hezekiah was like, 'Bro, they saw everything that's in my house, no secrets here. I wasn't holding back, showed 'em all my treasures and stuff.'"
2 Kings,20,16,"And Isaiah was like, yo Hezekiah, check it out, I got a message from the big man upstairs."
2 Kings,20,17,"Listen up, there's gonna be a time when everything in your crib and all the stuff your parents saved up will be hauled off to Babylon. The Lord's making it clear, there won't be anything left behind."
2 Kings,20,18,"And, like, some of your kids who come after you, that you're gonna have, they're gonna be taken away and end up as eunuchs in the king of Babylon's crib."
2 Kings,20,19,"Hezekiah said to Isaiah, 'That's a solid word from the LORD you just spoke. You know what, wouldn't it be awesome if peace and truth could reign during my time? Like, that would be legit!'"
2 Kings,20,20,"Yo, want to know more about Hezekiah? Dude was legit strong and did some awesome stuff, like building a sick pool and pipeline to bring water into the city. If you're curious about all the other cool things he did, you gotta check out the book of the kings of Judah, it's all written in there."
2 Kings,20,21,"And Hezekiah passed away, joining his ancestors, and Manasseh, his son, assumed the throne in his place."
2 Kings,21,1,"Manasseh was, like, 12 years old when he became king and he ruled for, like, 55 years in Jerusalem. His mom's name was Hephzibah, by the way."
2 Kings,21,2,"And he, like, totally did bad stuff that disgusted the LORD, copying the messed up things the unbelievers were doing, you know, the ones the LORD kicked out before the Israelites."
2 Kings,21,3,"So, this guy totally rebuilt those cool hilltop gathering spots that Hezekiah, his dad, had totally wrecked. Plus, he went all out and made these rad altars for Baal and even planted a grove, just like that Ahab, king of Israel, did back in the day. And get this, he actually worshiped all those celestial beings and did everything they asked!"
2 Kings,21,4,"And he, like, built these altars in the house of the LORD, you know. And the LORD was like, 'Yo, I'm totally gonna hook up my name in Jerusalem.'"
2 Kings,21,5,"And he, like, totally put up altars for all the cool celestial beings in both areas of the Lord's house."
2 Kings,21,6,"And he made his son go through some intense stuff, practiced all kinds of mystical rituals, and got involved with spirits and spellcasters: he did a whole lot of evil that seriously ticked off the LORD."
2 Kings,21,7,"So, he placed this cool statue of a grove that he made inside the house, just like the LORD told David and Solomon. This house in Jerusalem is pretty rad, it's the one the LORD picked out of all the tribes of Israel to put His name on forever!"
2 Kings,21,8,"I won't kick Israel out of the land I gave their ancestors anymore, just as long as they stay committed to following all the rules I've given them, just like my boy Moses told them to."
2 Kings,21,9,But they didn't listen: and Manasseh totally got them to do even more messed up stuff than the nations that got wiped out by the LORD before the Israelite peeps.
2 Kings,21,10,"And God spoke through his prophets, saying,"
2 Kings,21,11,"Yo, Manasseh, the king of Judah, seriously messed up. Like, he did some seriously messed up things that were even worse than what the Amorites did before him. And because of his actions, he caused the people of Judah to also sin by worshipping idols. Like, it was not cool at all."
2 Kings,21,12,"Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, is saying: Brace yourselves, 'cause I'm about to bring some serious trouble upon Jerusalem and Judah. It's gonna be so intense that when people hear about it, their ears will be tingling like crazy."
2 Kings,21,13,"And I'm gonna bring some major judgment vibes to Jerusalem, just like what went down in Samaria and in the house of Ahab. Jerusalem is about to get wiped clean, like when you fully clean a dish, flipping it upside down and getting rid of any residue. Seriously, it's gonna be intense."
2 Kings,21,14,"And I will totally ditch what's left of my people, and hand them over to their haters; they'll be totally taken advantage of and robbed by all their enemies;"
2 Kings,21,15,"Yo, they've been straight up doing evil stuff in front of me and getting me all mad, ever since their parents left Egypt till now."
2 Kings,21,16,"Manasseh was super brutal and killed a ton of innocent peeps, like flooded Jerusalem all over with their blood. Plus, he got Judah all messed up and made them do all kinds of wicked stuff that made the big man upstairs really ticked off."
2 Kings,21,17,"Yo, there's still more stuff that Manasseh did and all the wrong choices he made. You can find all the deets about it in the book that documents the history of the kings of Judah."
2 Kings,21,18,"And Manasseh passed away, and he was laid to rest in his own backyard, in the garden of Uzza. Then his son Amon took over as king."
2 Kings,21,19,"Amon was like 22 when he started being the boss in Jerusalem, and he ruled for about 2 years. His mom's name was Meshullemeth, and she was the daughter of Haruz from Jotbah."
2 Kings,21,20,"And he was totally not vibing with the LORD, just like his dad Manasseh."
2 Kings,21,21,"And he followed in the footsteps of his father, doing all the same things his dad did - serving the idols and worshiping them:"
2 Kings,21,22,"And he ditched the LORD God of his ancestors, and didn't follow the path the LORD laid out."
2 Kings,21,23,The squad of Amon's homies plotted against him and straight up took down the king in his own crib.
2 Kings,21,24,"Then the squad of peeps took down all those who plotted against King Amon; and the crew made Josiah, his son, the new king in his place."
2 Kings,21,25,"Yo, all the other stuff that Amon did, isn't it already written down in the book of the kings of Judah?"
2 Kings,21,26,"And they put him to rest in his fancy grave in the Uzza garden. Then Josiah, his son, took over as ruler. {Josiah: aka Josias}"
2 Kings,22,1,"Josiah was just 8 when he started being in charge, and he ruled over Jerusalem for 31 years. His mom's name was Jedidah, and she was the daughter of Adaiah from Boscath."
2 Kings,22,2,"He straight up did what the LORD thought was right and followed in his dad, David's, footsteps. He stayed on track without getting swayed to either side."
2 Kings,22,3,"So, like, in the year when King Josiah was 18 and all, the king decided to send this dude named Shaphan to the house of the LORD. Shaphan was the son of Azaliah and the grandson of Meshullam, and he was a total pro at writing stuff down, you know? Anyway, the king was like, 'Hey Shaphan, go to the house of the LORD and tell 'em what's up.'"
2 Kings,22,4,"Just head over to Hilkiah, the high priest, and ask him to count all the cash that's been brought to the house of the LORD. The guards at the entrance have gathered it from the people. {door: Hebrew for threshold}"
2 Kings,22,5,"And they should give it to the people in charge of the Lord's house, who will fix any damage or holes in the building."
2 Kings,22,6,"For the carpenters, builders, and masons to get supplies like wood and cut stones for fixing up the house."
2 Kings,22,7,"But they didn't have to show receipts or keep track of the money they were given, 'cause they were totally reliable and never messed up."
2 Kings,22,8,"Yo, Hilkiah, the high priest, tells Shaphan, the scribe, 'Yo, bro, I found the book of the law up in the house of the LORD!' Hilkiah hands the book to Shaphan, and he starts reading it, man."
2 Kings,22,9,"So Shaphan, the scribe, went up to the king and gave him an update. He said, 'Yo, bro! Your squad totally collected all the cash we found in the crib and handed it over to those in charge of keeping the house of the LORD in top shape.'"
2 Kings,22,10,"So Shaphan, the scribe, approached the king and said, 'Yo, Hilkiah the priest hooked me up with this lit book.' And then Shaphan started reading it for the king."
2 Kings,22,11,"So, like, when the king heard the words from the book of the law, he totally freaked out and tore his clothes."
2 Kings,22,12,"Then the king told Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, who is Shaphan's son, Achbor, who is Michaiah's son, Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah, one of the king's servants, this: {Achbor: or, Abdon} {Michaiah: or, Micah}"
2 Kings,22,13,"Hey, guys! So, like, go and hit up the LORD for me, you know? And not just for me, but for the whole crew and all of Judah. We gotta find out what the deal is with this book we found, 'cause the LORD is super mad at us. Our parents totally didn't listen to what this book says, and we need to get our act together and do everything it says about us."
2 Kings,22,14,"So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asahiah, went to talk to Huldah, the awesome prophetess. She's the wife of Shallum, Tikvah's son, Harhas' grandson, and keeper of all the fly outfits (you got that 'wardrobe' Hebrew translation!). She lives in Jerusalem, probably in some rad college, and they had a dope conversation with her."
2 Kings,22,15,"And she was like, yo dudes, the LORD God of Israel has a message for the guy who sent you to me,"
2 Kings,22,16,"Yo, listen up! The big man upstairs says, 'Pay attention, peeps! I'm about to bring some serious bad juju to this joint and everyone living in it, just like what the king of Judah read in that book.'"
2 Kings,22,17,"They've straight up abandoned me and are offering incense to other gods, just to tick me off with all the stuff they make. So now I'm about to get seriously mad at this place and there's no way I'm gonna calm down."
2 Kings,22,18,"Yo, to the king of Judah who sent you to ask the LORD, this is what you gotta tell him. The LORD God of Israel got something to say about the stuff you've been hearing."
2 Kings,22,19,"Because you were so soft-hearted and totally humbled yourself before the LORD, when you heard what I said about this place and its people being destroyed and cursed, and you tore your clothes and cried in front of me, I gotta say, I heard you loud and clear, says the LORD."
2 Kings,22,20,"Yo, listen up! I'm gonna bring you back to your ancestors and you'll peacefully rest in your grave. Lucky for you, you won't have to witness all the crazy bad stuff I'm gonna bring upon this area. The message got delivered to the king, just so you know."
2 Kings,23,1,"So the king messaged all the OGs from Judah and Jerusalem, and they all came together."
2 Kings,23,2,"So the king and all the people, including the guys from Judah and Jerusalem, as well as the priests, prophets, and everyone else, both young and old, went up to the house of the LORD. And the king straight up read aloud all the words of the book of the covenant that they found there."
2 Kings,23,3,"So the king goes over to a pillar and takes an oath in front of the LORD. He promises to follow the LORD, obey His commandments, testimonies, and statutes with all their heart and soul. They commit to fulfilling the words written in this book. And everyone there agrees to this covenant."
2 Kings,23,4,"So the king was like, 'Yo Hilkiah, the high priest, and all you other priests and doorkeepers, go get all those Baal and grove idols and stuff from the LORD's temple and burn 'em outside Jerusalem in the Kidron fields. Then take the ashes to Bethel.'"
2 Kings,23,5,"He got rid of the priests who were into idol worship, the ones that the kings of Judah had set up to burn incense in the high places across Judah and around Jerusalem. He even took down those who were burning incense to Baal, the sun, the moon, and all the cosmic stuff. (Btw, 'put down' here means he made them stop, and 'idolatrous priests' means the ones who worshipped idols, just fyi.)"
2 Kings,23,6,"Then he took the grove out of the LORD's house, outside of Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and set it on fire at the brook Kidron, and crushed it into tiny bits, and scattered the bits over the graves of the people's children."
2 Kings,23,7,"And he demolished the houses of those who engaged in wicked practices, which were near the house of the LORD, where the women made beautiful tapestries for idol worship."
2 Kings,23,8,"So he gathered all the priests from the different cities of Judah, and messed up the spots where they were offering incense, from Geba to Beersheba. He even destroyed the high places near the gates of the city, specifically the ones on the left of the gate, where Joshua the governor used to hang out."
2 Kings,23,9,"But even though the high-ranking priests didn't go to the main altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, they still got to eat the unleavened bread with their buddies."
2 Kings,23,10,"And he totally wrecked Topheth, which, like, it's this place in the valley where the children of Hinnom were at, you know? He did that so that nobody would ever do this messed up thing where they sacrifice their own kids in the fire for Molech. Like, that's just not cool, man."
2 Kings,23,11,"So, he, like, totally confiscated those horses that the kings of Judah dedicated to the sun god, right at the entrance of the Lord's house. It was near Nathanmelech's office in the suburbs. And guess what? He actually set fire to those sun chariots. Yeah, burned them to a crisp! (BTW, Nathanmelech might be a eunuch or some high-ranking officer, just saying)"
2 Kings,23,12,"So, the king totally destroyed the altars on the upper floor of Ahaz's palace that the kings of Judah had built. He also smashed the altars that Manasseh had set up in the two courtyards of the house of the LORD. Then he threw the dust from those altars into the brook Kidron. It was a total demolition!"
2 Kings,23,13,"And the cool hangout spots that were around Jerusalem, on the right side of the shady hill where bad stuff went down, which King Solomon of Israel built for Ashtoreth (a god the Zidonians worshiped) and for Chemosh (a god the Moabites thought was cool) and for Milcom (a god the Ammonites were into), the king totally ruined. (That shady hill was actually the Mount of Olives, BTW.)"
2 Kings,23,14,"And he totally smashed all those statues, like, broke them to smithereens, and chopped down all those groves, and filled up those spots with human remains. Like, he didn't play around, he got rid of all those false idols and replaced them with bones of real people. So legit, man! {images: Heb. statues}"
2 Kings,23,15,"Yo, so there was this altar at Bethel, right? And this high place that Jeroboam, Nebat's son, made. He's the one who led Israel into sin. Well, guess what? He totally wrecked that altar and burned down the high place. Then he crushed it to tiny bits and burned the grove. It was intense, bro."
2 Kings,23,16,"And when Josiah turned around, he noticed the tombs that were on the hill. He then sent someone to retrieve the bones from the tombs and burned them on the altar, which made it impure, just as the LORD's message from the man of God said."
2 Kings,23,17,"And he was like, 'Yo, what's up with that sign over there?' And the locals were like, 'Oh, that's the tomb of the dude who came all the way from Judah and called out the messed up stuff you did to the altar in Bethel.'"
2 Kings,23,18,"And he was like, leave him be; don't mess with his bones. So they just left his bones alone, along with the bones of that prophet from Samaria."
2 Kings,23,19,Josiah straight up yeeted all those fancy high places that the Israelite kings built in Samaria to tick off the Lord. He totally got rid of them and did the same thing he did to them in Bethel.
2 Kings,23,20,"Then he got rid of all the priests at the fancy worship spots, sacrificed them on the altars, and burned people's bones on them. Afterwards, he went back to Jerusalem."
2 Kings,23,21,"And the king's like, yo, everyone gotta celebrate Passover for the LORD your God, just like it says in the book of this agreement, fam."
2 Kings,23,22,"For real, there has never been a Passover like this since the OG judges in Israel, or even during the time of the kings of Israel and Judah. No cap."
2 Kings,23,23,"But yo, in the eighteenth year that king Josiah was rockin' it, this passover party went down in Jerusalem to give major props to the LORD."
2 Kings,23,24,"Josiah got rid of all the fortune tellers, magicians, idols, and other disgusting stuff that he found in Judah and Jerusalem. He did this to follow the rules written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD."
2 Kings,23,25,"And there was no king before him who was like him, who wholeheartedly turned to the LORD and followed all the laws of Moses, and there was no one like him after him either."
2 Kings,23,26,"But like, even though the LORD was super mad and furious at Judah because of all the stuff Manasseh did to piss Him off, He didn't like, back down from His anger and stuff. Like, it was a really intense situation and there were, like, a lot of things that made God angry."
2 Kings,23,27,"God said, Judah's getting the boot just like Israel did. Jerusalem, the city I picked, is getting ghosted too. And the house where I said my name would be? Yeah, it's gonna be left behind."
2 Kings,23,28,"Yo, if you wanna know more about what Josiah did, check out the book of the kings of Judah. It's all written down there, fam."
2 Kings,23,29,"During this time, Pharaohnechoh, the boss of Egypt, decided to take on the king of Assyria by heading to the river Euphrates. Our dude, king Josiah, wasn't about to back down, so he went up against Pharaohnechoh and straight up took him out at a place called Megiddo. No messing around, just quick and decisive - Josiah saw him and finished him off."
2 Kings,23,30,"And then his homies took his lifeless body in a fancy carriage from Megiddo and rolled him all the way to Jerusalem, where they laid him to rest in his own tomb. Meanwhile, the locals crowned Jehoahaz, son of Josiah, and gave him the royal treatment, making him the new king in his pops' place."
2 Kings,23,31,"Jehoahaz took the throne at the age of 23 and ruled over Jerusalem for only 3 months. His mom's name was Hamutal, and she was the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah. (Jehoahaz was also known as Shallum.)"
2 Kings,23,32,"And he, like, did some really messed up stuff in the eyes of the LORD, following in the footsteps of his ancestors and all."
2 Kings,23,33,"Pharaohnechoh straight-up locked him down in Riblah, in the land of Hamath, so he couldn't be the ruler of Jerusalem anymore. And to add insult to injury, he made them pay a hefty fee of a hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold. Talk about a fine!"
2 Kings,23,34,"So like, Pharaohnechoh was like, 'Hey Eliakim, you're the new king now instead of your dad Josiah!' And then Pharaohnechoh changed his name to Jehoiakim, and he totally took Jehoahaz away. And guess what? Jehoiakim went to Egypt, and that's where he passed away."
2 Kings,23,35,"So Jehoiakim gave Pharaoh all the silver and gold. But to gather the money, he made the people pay taxes as Pharaoh commanded. Each person had to give a certain amount based on their income, and it all went straight to Pharaohnechoh."
2 Kings,23,36,"Jehoiakim was like 25 when he started ruling, and he ruled for 11 years in Jerusalem. His mom's name was Zebudah, and she was Pedaiah from Rumah's daughter."
2 Kings,23,37,"And he did some really messed up stuff in God's view, just like his parents did."
2 Kings,24,1,"So, like, during that time when Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, was in charge, Jehoiakim was all serving him for three years and then he was like, 'Nah, I'm outta here' and rebelled against him."
2 Kings,24,2,"Then God sent groups of the Chaldeans, Syrians, Moabites, and Ammonites to go against Judah and wreck it, just like He said through His prophets."
2 Kings,24,3,"Like, the LORD totally made this happen to Judah because they were like so not cool in His eyes, all because of Manasseh's sins, you know, everything he did and stuff."
2 Kings,24,4,"And like, because of all the innocent blood he like totally spilled, man: he straight up filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the Lord was like not gonna let that slide, you know?"
2 Kings,24,5,"Like, wanna know more about what Jehoiakim did? Check out the book of chronicles of the kings of Judah, fam. It's all there, every single detail!"
2 Kings,24,6,"And then Jehoiakim passed away, and Jehoiachin, his son, became the new ruler."
2 Kings,24,7,"So basically, the king of Egypt couldn't leave his own turf anymore because the king of Babylon straight up snagged everything under the king of Egypt's control, all the way from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates."
2 Kings,24,8,"Jehoiachin was just 18 when he took the throne, ruling over Jerusalem for a quick three months. His mom's name was Nehushta, and she was the daughter of Elnathan, a Jerusalem OG. By the way, Jehoiachin also went by the names Jeconiah and Coniah."
2 Kings,24,9,"And he did some seriously messed up stuff that made the LORD super disappointed, just like his dad did before him."
2 Kings,24,10,"So, like, one day the peeps who worked for Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, surrounded Jerusalem and put it in lockdown. This city was totally besieged, ya know."
2 Kings,24,11,"So, like, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, totally came and attacked the city, and his crew showed up and surrounded it."
2 Kings,24,12,"So Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, rolled up on the king of Babylon along with his squad, his mom, his crew, and his entourage. And yo, the king of Babylon straight up nabbed him in his eighth year on the throne. (P.S. officers can also mean eunuchs, just saying. And Nebuchadnezzar was the king in his eighth year, you feel?)"
2 Kings,24,13,"And he like totally grabbed all the lit treasures from the LORD's crib and the king's crib, and smashed all the sick gold stuff that King Solomon made for the LORD's hangout, just like the LORD said."
2 Kings,24,14,"And he took everybody from Jerusalem, including all the leaders and the brave warriors, like, ten thousand prisoners, and all the skilled workers and craftsmen. Like, no one was left behind except for the poorest people in the land."
2 Kings,24,15,"Then he took Jehoiachin, the king's mom, the king's wives, his peeps, and the powerful folks from the land and brought them as captive to Babylon from Jerusalem. (BTW, officers here can also mean eunuchs)"
2 Kings,24,16,"So, like, the king of Babylon totally captured about 7,000 brave dudes, plus like, a thousand skilled craftsmen and smiths. They were all strong and ready for war, and he brought them as captives to Babylon."
2 Kings,24,17,"So, like, the king of Babylon, right, he made Mattaniah, his dad's brother, the new king instead. And get this, he even gave him a cool new name, Zedekiah."
2 Kings,24,18,"Zedekiah became king when he was 21 years old and ruled over Jerusalem for 11 years. His mom's name was Hamutal, and she was the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah."
2 Kings,24,19,"And he straight up did some messed up stuff that the LORD was seriously not cool with, just like Jehoiakim did."
2 Kings,24,20,"So, basically, God got super mad and decided to punish the people of Jerusalem and Judah by kicking them out of His sight. And guess what? Zedekiah was like, 'Nah, I ain't playin' along with the king of Babylon!'"
2 Kings,25,1,"So, like, in the ninth year that Nebuchadnezzar was king, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of that month, he and all his crew rolled up to Jerusalem and set up camp. They even built some sick forts all around the city."
2 Kings,25,2,"And the city was totally locked down until King Zedekiah's eleventh year, like, no one could get in or out, it was like a fortress."
2 Kings,25,3,"And like, on the ninth day of the fourth month, the whole city was dealing with a major famine, ya know? No bread left for the peeps living there."
2 Kings,25,4,"And the city was totally wrecked, and all the dudes who fought for the city straight up bounced in the middle of the night through this sick backdoor route between two walls, right outside the king's fancy garden. (By the way, the Chaldees were totally surrounding the city, just in case you didn't know.) And the king peaced out towards the open field."
2 Kings,25,5,"Then the Chaldees' squad came chasing after the king, and caught up with him in the Jericho fields. And all his crew got split up and scattered."
2 Kings,25,6,"So they captured the king and brought him before the king of Babylon in Riblah, and they passed judgment on him. {passed judgment: Hebrew for talked things over with him}"
2 Kings,25,7,"So they killed Zedekiah's sons right in front of him, and then they blinded Zedekiah and chained him up with brass cuffs. After that, they took him to Babylon."
2 Kings,25,8,"So, like, in the fifth month, on the seventh day, you know, it was the nineteenth year that King Nebuchadnezzar, the ruler of Babylon, was in charge. And then this dude, Nebuzaradan, the head honcho of the palace guards, you feel me, who was like a servant to the Babylonian king, like, totally showed up in Jerusalem."
2 Kings,25,9,"And he completely destroyed the house of the LORD, the king's house, and all the crib houses in Jerusalem. Every fancy house went up in flames."
2 Kings,25,10,"And all the squad of the Chaldees, who were rolling with the leader of the squad, totally wrecked the walls of Jerusalem from all sides."
2 Kings,25,11,"So, like, there were still some peeps left in the city, ya know? And those who ran away to join the king of Babylon, plus the remaining crew, got taken away by Nebuzaradan, the big boss of the guards. (By the way, 'fugitives' means those who bailed on their peeps, if you didn't know.)"
2 Kings,25,12,"So, like, the captain of the guard, right? He totally let some of the poor peeps stay behind to work on the vineyards and farms, you know?"
2 Kings,25,13,"The Chaldeans totally wrecked the brass pillars, bases, and bronze sea in the LORD's house and took all that bronze to Babylon."
2 Kings,25,14,"And they grabbed all the pots, shovels, snuffers, spoons, and every brass instrument they used for their duties."
2 Kings,25,15,"Then the captain of the guard grabbed all the firepans, bowls, and other golden and silver stuff and took them away, matching gold with gold and silver with silver."
2 Kings,25,16,"Solomon made two big pillars, a huge water basin, and some strong bases for the LORD's house. The brass used for all of these things was so heavy that it couldn't even be weighed. #impressive"
2 Kings,25,17,"The first pillar was like eighteen cubits tall, with a cool brass chapiter on top that was like three cubits tall. It had these dope wreathen work and pomegranates all around it, also made of brass. The second pillar was just as rad, with the same kind of wreathen work."
