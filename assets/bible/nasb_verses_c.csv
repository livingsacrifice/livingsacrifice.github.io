1 Chronicles,29,24,"All the officials, the mighty men, and also all the sons of King David pledged allegiance to King Solomon."
1 Chronicles,29,25,"The LORD highly exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed on him royal majesty which had not been on any king before him in Israel."
1 Chronicles,29,26,Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
1 Chronicles,29,27,The period which he reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned in Hebron seven years and in Jerusalem thirty-three years.
1 Chronicles,29,28,"Then he died in a ripe old age, full of days, riches and honor; and his son Solomon reigned in his place."
1 Chronicles,29,29,"Now the acts of King David, from first to last, are written in the chronicles of Samuel the seer, in the chronicles of Nathan the prophet and in the chronicles of Gad the seer,"
1 Chronicles,29,30,"with all his reign, his power, and the circumstances which came on him, on Israel, and on all the kingdoms of the lands."
2 Chronicles,1,1,"Now Solomon the son of David established himself securely over his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him and exalted him greatly."
2 Chronicles,1,2,"Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds and to the judges and to every leader in all Israel, the heads of the fathers’ households."
2 Chronicles,1,3,"Then Solomon and all the assembly with him went to the high place which was at Gibeon, for God’s tent of meeting was there, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness."
2 Chronicles,1,4,"However, David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place he had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,1,5,"Now the bronze altar, which Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of the LORD, and Solomon and the assembly sought it out."
2 Chronicles,1,6,"Solomon went up there before the LORD to the bronze altar which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it."
2 Chronicles,1,7,"In that night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, “Ask what I shall give you.”"
2 Chronicles,1,8,"Solomon said to God, “You have dealt with my father David with great lovingkindness, and have made me king in his place."
2 Chronicles,1,9,"Now, O LORD God, Your promise to my father David is fulfilled, for You have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth."
2 Chronicles,1,10,"Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people, for who can rule this great people of Yours?”"
2 Chronicles,1,11,"God said to Solomon, “Because you had this in mind, and did not ask for riches, wealth or honor, or the life of those who hate you, nor have you even asked for long life, but you have asked for yourself wisdom and knowledge that you may rule My people over whom I have made you king,"
2 Chronicles,1,12,"wisdom and knowledge have been granted to you. And I will give you riches and wealth and honor, such as none of the kings who were before you has possessed nor those who will come after you.”"
2 Chronicles,1,13,"So Solomon went from the high place which was at Gibeon, from the tent of meeting, to Jerusalem, and he reigned over Israel."
2 Chronicles,1,14,"Solomon amassed chariots and horsemen. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, and he stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,1,15,"The king made silver and gold as plentiful in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as plentiful as sycamores in the lowland."
2 Chronicles,1,16,Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue; the king’s traders procured them from Kue for a price.
2 Chronicles,1,17,"They imported chariots from Egypt for 600 shekels of silver apiece and horses for 150 apiece, and by the same means they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram."
2 Chronicles,2,1,Now Solomon decided to build a house for the name of the LORD and a royal palace for himself.
2 Chronicles,2,2,"So Solomon assigned 70,000 men to carry loads and 80,000 men to quarry stone in the mountains and 3,600 to supervise them."
2 Chronicles,2,3,"Then Solomon sent word to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, “As you dealt with David my father and sent him cedars to build him a house to dwell in, so do for me."
2 Chronicles,2,4,"Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, dedicating it to Him, to burn fragrant incense before Him and to set out the showbread continually, and to offer burnt offerings morning and evening, on sabbaths and on new moons and on the appointed feasts of the LORD our God, this being required forever in Israel."
2 Chronicles,2,5,"The house which I am about to build will be great, for greater is our God than all the gods."
2 Chronicles,2,6,"But who is able to build a house for Him, for the heavens and the highest heavens cannot contain Him? So who am I, that I should build a house for Him, except to burn incense before Him?"
2 Chronicles,2,7,"Now send me a skilled man to work in gold, silver, brass and iron, and in purple, crimson and violet fabrics, and who knows how to make engravings, to work with the skilled men whom I have in Judah and Jerusalem, whom David my father provided."
2 Chronicles,2,8,"Send me also cedar, cypress and algum timber from Lebanon, for I know that your servants know how to cut timber of Lebanon; and indeed my servants will work with your servants,"
2 Chronicles,2,9,"to prepare timber in abundance for me, for the house which I am about to build will be great and wonderful."
2 Chronicles,2,10,"Now behold, I will give to your servants, the woodsmen who cut the timber, 20,000 kors of crushed wheat and 20,000 kors of barley, and 20,000 baths of wine and 20,000 baths of oil.”"
2 Chronicles,2,11,"Then Huram, king of Tyre, answered in a letter sent to Solomon: “Because the LORD loves His people, He has made you king over them.”"
2 Chronicles,2,12,"Then Huram continued, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who has made heaven and earth, who has given King David a wise son, endowed with discretion and understanding, who will build a house for the LORD and a royal palace for himself."
2 Chronicles,2,13,"“Now I am sending Huram-abi, a skilled man, endowed with understanding,"
2 Chronicles,2,14,"the son of a Danite woman and a Tyrian father, who knows how to work in gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone and wood, and in purple, violet, linen and crimson fabrics, and who knows how to make all kinds of engravings and to execute any design which may be assigned to him, to work with your skilled men and with those of my lord David your father."
2 Chronicles,2,15,"Now then, let my lord send to his servants wheat and barley, oil and wine, of which he has spoken."
2 Chronicles,2,16,"We will cut whatever timber you need from Lebanon and bring it to you on rafts by sea to Joppa, so that you may carry it up to Jerusalem.”"
2 Chronicles,2,17,"Solomon numbered all the aliens who were in the land of Israel, following the census which his father David had taken; and 153,600 were found."
2 Chronicles,2,18,"He appointed 70,000 of them to carry loads and 80,000 to quarry stones in the mountains and 3,600 supervisors to make the people work."
2 Chronicles,3,1,"Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the LORD had appeared to his father David, at the place that David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite."
2 Chronicles,3,2,He began to build on the second day in the second month of the fourth year of his reign.
2 Chronicles,3,3,"Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for building the house of God. The length in cubits, according to the old standard was sixty cubits, and the width twenty cubits."
2 Chronicles,3,4,"The porch which was in front of the house was as long as the width of the house, twenty cubits, and the height 120; and inside he overlaid it with pure gold."
2 Chronicles,3,5,"He overlaid the main room with cypress wood and overlaid it with fine gold, and ornamented it with palm trees and chains."
2 Chronicles,3,6,"Further, he adorned the house with precious stones; and the gold was gold from Parvaim."
2 Chronicles,3,7,"He also overlaid the house with gold—the beams, the thresholds and its walls and its doors; and he carved cherubim on the walls."
2 Chronicles,3,8,"Now he made the room of the holy of holies: its length across the width of the house was twenty cubits, and its width was twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to 600 talents."
2 Chronicles,3,9,The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. He also overlaid the upper rooms with gold.
2 Chronicles,3,10,Then he made two sculptured cherubim in the room of the holy of holies and overlaid them with gold.
2 Chronicles,3,11,"The wingspan of the cherubim was twenty cubits; the wing of one, of five cubits, touched the wall of the house, and its other wing, of five cubits, touched the wing of the other cherub."
2 Chronicles,3,12,"The wing of the other cherub, of five cubits, touched the wall of the house; and its other wing of five cubits was attached to the wing of the first cherub."
2 Chronicles,3,13,"The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits, and they stood on their feet facing the main room."
2 Chronicles,3,14,"He made the veil of violet, purple, crimson and fine linen, and he worked cherubim on it."
2 Chronicles,3,15,"He also made two pillars for the front of the house, thirty-five cubits high, and the capital on the top of each was five cubits."
2 Chronicles,3,16,He made chains in the inner sanctuary and placed them on the tops of the pillars; and he made one hundred pomegranates and placed them on the chains.
2 Chronicles,3,17,"He erected the pillars in front of the temple, one on the right and the other on the left, and named the one on the right Jachin and the one on the left Boaz."
2 Chronicles,4,1,"Then he made a bronze altar, twenty cubits in length and twenty cubits in width and ten cubits in height."
2 Chronicles,4,2,"Also he made the cast metal sea, ten cubits from brim to brim, circular in form, and its height was five cubits and its circumference thirty cubits."
2 Chronicles,4,3,"Now figures like oxen were under it and all around it, ten cubits, entirely encircling the sea. The oxen were in two rows, cast in one piece."
2 Chronicles,4,4,"It stood on twelve oxen, three facing the north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east; and the sea was set on top of them and all their hindquarters turned inwards."
2 Chronicles,4,5,"It was a handbreadth thick, and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom; it could hold 3,000 baths."
2 Chronicles,4,6,"He also made ten basins in which to wash, and he set five on the right side and five on the left to rinse things for the burnt offering; but the sea was for the priests to wash in."
2 Chronicles,4,7,"Then he made the ten golden lampstands in the way prescribed for them and he set them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left."
2 Chronicles,4,8,"He also made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. And he made one hundred golden bowls."
2 Chronicles,4,9,"Then he made the court of the priests and the great court and doors for the court, and overlaid their doors with bronze."
2 Chronicles,4,10,He set the sea on the right side of the house toward the southeast.
2 Chronicles,4,11,"Huram also made the pails, the shovels and the bowls. So Huram finished doing the work which he performed for King Solomon in the house of God:"
2 Chronicles,4,12,"the two pillars, the bowls and the two capitals on top of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on top of the pillars,"
2 Chronicles,4,13,"and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on the pillars."
2 Chronicles,4,14,"He also made the stands and he made the basins on the stands,"
2 Chronicles,4,15,and the one sea with the twelve oxen under it.
2 Chronicles,4,16,"The pails, the shovels, the forks and all its utensils, Huram-abi made of polished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,4,17,On the plain of the Jordan the king cast them in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.
2 Chronicles,4,18,"Thus Solomon made all these utensils in great quantities, for the weight of the bronze could not be found out."
2 Chronicles,4,19,"Solomon also made all the things that were in the house of God: even the golden altar, the tables with the bread of the Presence on them,"
2 Chronicles,4,20,"the lampstands with their lamps of pure gold, to burn in front of the inner sanctuary in the way prescribed;"
2 Chronicles,4,21,"the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs of gold, of purest gold;"
2 Chronicles,4,22,"and the snuffers, the bowls, the spoons and the firepans of pure gold; and the entrance of the house, its inner doors for the holy of holies and the doors of the house, that is, of the nave, of gold."
2 Chronicles,5,1,"Thus all the work that Solomon performed for the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, even the silver and the gold and all the utensils, and put them in the treasuries of the house of God."
2 Chronicles,5,2,"Then Solomon assembled to Jerusalem the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the fathers’ households of the sons of Israel, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion."
2 Chronicles,5,3,"All the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king at the feast, that is in the seventh month."
2 Chronicles,5,4,"Then all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark."
2 Chronicles,5,5,They brought up the ark and the tent of meeting and all the holy utensils which were in the tent; the Levitical priests brought them up.
2 Chronicles,5,6,"And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled with him before the ark, were sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered."
2 Chronicles,5,7,"Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the house, to the holy of holies, under the wings of the cherubim."
2 Chronicles,5,8,"For the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim made a covering over the ark and its poles."
2 Chronicles,5,9,"The poles were so long that the ends of the poles of the ark could be seen in front of the inner sanctuary, but they could not be seen outside; and they are there to this day."
2 Chronicles,5,10,"There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets which Moses put there at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the sons of Israel, when they came out of Egypt."
2 Chronicles,5,11,"When the priests came forth from the holy place (for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves, without regard to divisions),"
2 Chronicles,5,12,"and all the Levitical singers, Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and kinsmen, clothed in fine linen, with cymbals, harps and lyres, standing east of the altar, and with them one hundred and twenty priests blowing trumpets"
2 Chronicles,5,13,"in unison when the trumpeters and the singers were to make themselves heard with one voice to praise and to glorify the LORD, and when they lifted up their voice accompanied by trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and when they praised the LORD saying, “He indeed is good for His lovingkindness is everlasting,” then the house, the house of the LORD, was filled with a cloud,"
2 Chronicles,5,14,"so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled the house of God."
2 Chronicles,6,1,"Then Solomon said, “The LORD has said that He would dwell in the thick cloud."
2 Chronicles,6,2,"“I have built You a lofty house, And a place for Your dwelling forever.”"
2 Chronicles,6,3,"Then the king faced about and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel was standing."
2 Chronicles,6,4,"He said, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who spoke with His mouth to my father David and has fulfilled it with His hands, saying,"
2 Chronicles,6,5,"‘Since the day that I brought My people from the land of Egypt, I did not choose a city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house that My name might be there, nor did I choose any man for a leader over My people Israel;"
2 Chronicles,6,6,"but I have chosen Jerusalem that My name might be there, and I have chosen David to be over My people Israel.’"
2 Chronicles,6,7,"Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,6,8,"But the LORD said to my father David, ‘Because it was in your heart to build a house for My name, you did well that it was in your heart."
2 Chronicles,6,9,"Nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who will be born to you, he shall build the house for My name.’"
2 Chronicles,6,10,"Now the LORD has fulfilled His word which He spoke; for I have risen in the place of my father David and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,6,11,"There I have set the ark in which is the covenant of the LORD, which He made with the sons of Israel.”"
2 Chronicles,6,12,Then he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands.
2 Chronicles,6,13,"Now Solomon had made a bronze platform, five cubits long, five cubits wide and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and he stood on it, knelt on his knees in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven."
2 Chronicles,6,14,"He said, “O LORD, the God of Israel, there is no god like You in heaven or on earth, keeping covenant and showing lovingkindness to Your servants who walk before You with all their heart;"
2 Chronicles,6,15,"who has kept with Your servant David, my father, that which You have promised him; indeed You have spoken with Your mouth and have fulfilled it with Your hand, as it is this day."
2 Chronicles,6,16,"Now therefore, O LORD, the God of Israel, keep with Your servant David, my father, that which You have promised him, saying, ‘You shall not lack a man to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your sons take heed to their way, to walk in My law as you have walked before Me.’"
2 Chronicles,6,17,"Now therefore, O LORD, the God of Israel, let Your word be confirmed which You have spoken to Your servant David."
2 Chronicles,6,18,"“But will God indeed dwell with mankind on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain You; how much less this house which I have built."
2 Chronicles,6,19,"Yet have regard to the prayer of Your servant and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer which Your servant prays before You;"
2 Chronicles,6,20,"that Your eye may be open toward this house day and night, toward the place of which You have said that You would put Your name there, to listen to the prayer which Your servant shall pray toward this place."
2 Chronicles,6,21,"Listen to the supplications of Your servant and of Your people Israel when they pray toward this place; hear from Your dwelling place, from heaven; hear and forgive."
2 Chronicles,6,22,"“If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take an oath, and he comes and takes an oath before Your altar in this house,"
2 Chronicles,6,23,"then hear from heaven and act and judge Your servants, punishing the wicked by bringing his way on his own head and justifying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness."
2 Chronicles,6,24,"“If Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against You, and they return to You and confess Your name, and pray and make supplication before You in this house,"
2 Chronicles,6,25,"then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and bring them back to the land which You have given to them and to their fathers."
2 Chronicles,6,26,"“When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against You, and they pray toward this place and confess Your name, and turn from their sin when You afflict them;"
2 Chronicles,6,27,"then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants and Your people Israel, indeed, teach them the good way in which they should walk. And send rain on Your land which You have given to Your people for an inheritance."
2 Chronicles,6,28,"“If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blight or mildew, if there is locust or grasshopper, if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities, whatever plague or whatever sickness there is,"
2 Chronicles,6,29,"whatever prayer or supplication is made by any man or by all Your people Israel, each knowing his own affliction and his own pain, and spreading his hands toward this house,"
2 Chronicles,6,30,"then hear from heaven Your dwelling place, and forgive, and render to each according to all his ways, whose heart You know for You alone know the hearts of the sons of men,"
2 Chronicles,6,31,"that they may fear You, to walk in Your ways as long as they live in the land which You have given to our fathers."
2 Chronicles,6,32,"“Also concerning the foreigner who is not from Your people Israel, when he comes from a far country for Your great name’s sake and Your mighty hand and Your outstretched arm, when they come and pray toward this house,"
2 Chronicles,6,33,"then hear from heaven, from Your dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You, in order that all the peoples of the earth may know Your name, and fear You as do Your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by Your name."
2 Chronicles,6,34,"“When Your people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way You shall send them, and they pray to You toward this city which You have chosen and the house which I have built for Your name,"
2 Chronicles,6,35,"then hear from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause."
2 Chronicles,6,36,"“When they sin against You (for there is no man who does not sin) and You are angry with them and deliver them to an enemy, so that they take them away captive to a land far off or near,"
2 Chronicles,6,37,"if they take thought in the land where they are taken captive, and repent and make supplication to You in the land of their captivity, saying, ‘We have sinned, we have committed iniquity and have acted wickedly’;"
2 Chronicles,6,38,"if they return to You with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have been taken captive, and pray toward their land which You have given to their fathers and the city which You have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for Your name,"
2 Chronicles,6,39,"then hear from heaven, from Your dwelling place, their prayer and supplications, and maintain their cause and forgive Your people who have sinned against You."
2 Chronicles,6,40,"“Now, O my God, I pray, let Your eyes be open and Your ears attentive to the prayer offered in this place."
2 Chronicles,6,41,"“Now therefore arise, O LORD God, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your might; let Your priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation and let Your godly ones rejoice in what is good."
2 Chronicles,6,42,"“O LORD God, do not turn away the face of Your anointed; remember Your lovingkindness to Your servant David.”"
2 Chronicles,7,1,"Now when Solomon had finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the LORD filled the house."
2 Chronicles,7,2,The priests could not enter into the house of the LORD because the glory of the LORD filled the LORD’S house.
2 Chronicles,7,3,"All the sons of Israel, seeing the fire come down and the glory of the LORD upon the house, bowed down on the pavement with their faces to the ground, and they worshiped and gave praise to the LORD, saying, “Truly He is good, truly His lovingkindness is everlasting.”"
2 Chronicles,7,4,Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before the LORD.
2 Chronicles,7,5,"King Solomon offered a sacrifice of 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. Thus the king and all the people dedicated the house of God."
2 Chronicles,7,6,"The priests stood at their posts, and the Levites also, with the instruments of music to the LORD, which King David had made for giving praise to the LORD—“for His lovingkindness is everlasting”—whenever he gave praise by their means, while the priests on the other side blew trumpets; and all Israel was standing."
2 Chronicles,7,7,"Then Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD, for there he offered the burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings because the bronze altar which Solomon had made was not able to contain the burnt offering, the grain offering and the fat."
2 Chronicles,7,8,"So Solomon observed the feast at that time for seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly who came from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt."
2 Chronicles,7,9,"On the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, for the dedication of the altar they observed seven days and the feast seven days."
2 Chronicles,7,10,"Then on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people to their tents, rejoicing and happy of heart because of the goodness that the LORD had shown to David and to Solomon and to His people Israel."
2 Chronicles,7,11,"Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD and the king’s palace, and successfully completed all that he had planned on doing in the house of the LORD and in his palace."
2 Chronicles,7,12,"Then the LORD appeared to Solomon at night and said to him, “I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for Myself as a house of sacrifice."
2 Chronicles,7,13,"If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among My people,"
2 Chronicles,7,14,"and My people who are called by My name humble themselves and pray and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin and will heal their land."
2 Chronicles,7,15,Now My eyes will be open and My ears attentive to the prayer offered in this place.
2 Chronicles,7,16,"For now I have chosen and consecrated this house that My name may be there forever, and My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually."
2 Chronicles,7,17,"As for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, even to do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep My statutes and My ordinances,"
2 Chronicles,7,18,"then I will establish your royal throne as I covenanted with your father David, saying, ‘You shall not lack a man to be ruler in Israel.’"
2 Chronicles,7,19,"“But if you turn away and forsake My statutes and My commandments which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them,"
2 Chronicles,7,20,"then I will uproot you from My land which I have given you, and this house which I have consecrated for My name I will cast out of My sight and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples."
2 Chronicles,7,21,"As for this house, which was exalted, everyone who passes by it will be astonished and say, ‘Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to this house?’"
2 Chronicles,7,22,"And they will say, ‘Because they forsook the LORD, the God of their fathers who brought them from the land of Egypt, and they adopted other gods and worshiped them and served them; therefore He has brought all this adversity on them.’”"
2 Chronicles,8,1,Now it came about at the end of the twenty years in which Solomon had built the house of the LORD and his own house
2 Chronicles,8,2,"that he built the cities which Huram had given to him, and settled the sons of Israel there."
2 Chronicles,8,3,Then Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and captured it.
2 Chronicles,8,4,He built Tadmor in the wilderness and all the storage cities which he had built in Hamath.
2 Chronicles,8,5,"He also built upper Beth-horon and lower Beth-horon, fortified cities with walls, gates and bars;"
2 Chronicles,8,6,"and Baalath and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots and cities for his horsemen, and all that it pleased Solomon to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land under his rule."
2 Chronicles,8,7,"All of the people who were left of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel,"
2 Chronicles,8,8,"namely, from their descendants who were left after them in the land whom the sons of Israel had not destroyed, them Solomon raised as forced laborers to this day."
2 Chronicles,8,9,"But Solomon did not make slaves for his work from the sons of Israel; they were men of war, his chief captains and commanders of his chariots and his horsemen."
2 Chronicles,8,10,"These were the chief officers of King Solomon, two hundred and fifty who ruled over the people."
2 Chronicles,8,11,"Then Solomon brought Pharaoh’s daughter up from the city of David to the house which he had built for her, for he said, “My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy where the ark of the LORD has entered.”"
2 Chronicles,8,12,Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of the LORD which he had built before the porch;
2 Chronicles,8,13,"and did so according to the daily rule, offering them up according to the commandment of Moses, for the sabbaths, the new moons and the three annual feasts—the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks and the Feast of Booths."
2 Chronicles,8,14,"Now according to the ordinance of his father David, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their service, and the Levites for their duties of praise and ministering before the priests according to the daily rule, and the gatekeepers by their divisions at every gate; for David the man of God had so commanded."
2 Chronicles,8,15,And they did not depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites in any manner or concerning the storehouses.
2 Chronicles,8,16,"Thus all the work of Solomon was carried out from the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was completed."
2 Chronicles,8,17,Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Eloth on the seashore in the land of Edom.
2 Chronicles,8,18,"And Huram by his servants sent him ships and servants who knew the sea; and they went with Solomon’s servants to Ophir, and took from there four hundred and fifty talents of gold and brought them to King Solomon."
2 Chronicles,9,1,"Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to Jerusalem to test Solomon with difficult questions. She had a very large retinue, with camels carrying spices and a large amount of gold and precious stones; and when she came to Solomon, she spoke with him about all that was on her heart."
2 Chronicles,9,2,Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was hidden from Solomon which he did not explain to her.
2 Chronicles,9,3,"When the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the house which he had built,"
2 Chronicles,9,4,"the food at his table, the seating of his servants, the attendance of his ministers and their attire, his cupbearers and their attire, and his stairway by which he went up to the house of the LORD, she was breathless."
2 Chronicles,9,5,"Then she said to the king, “It was a true report which I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom."
2 Chronicles,9,6,"Nevertheless I did not believe their reports until I came and my eyes had seen it. And behold, the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me. You surpass the report that I heard."
2 Chronicles,9,7,"How blessed are your men, how blessed are these your servants who stand before you continually and hear your wisdom."
2 Chronicles,9,8,"Blessed be the LORD your God who delighted in you, setting you on His throne as king for the LORD your God; because your God loved Israel establishing them forever, therefore He made you king over them, to do justice and righteousness.”"
2 Chronicles,9,9,Then she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold and a very great amount of spices and precious stones; there had never been spice like that which the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
2 Chronicles,9,10,"The servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir, also brought algum trees and precious stones."
2 Chronicles,9,11,"From the algum trees the king made steps for the house of the LORD and for the king’s palace, and lyres and harps for the singers; and none like that was seen before in the land of Judah."
2 Chronicles,9,12,King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire which she requested besides a return for what she had brought to the king. Then she turned and went to her own land with her servants.
2 Chronicles,9,13,"Now the weight of gold which came to Solomon in one year was 666 talents of gold,"
2 Chronicles,9,14,besides that which the traders and merchants brought; and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.
2 Chronicles,9,15,"King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten gold, using 600 shekels of beaten gold on each large shield."
2 Chronicles,9,16,"He made 300 shields of beaten gold, using three hundred shekels of gold on each shield, and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon."
2 Chronicles,9,17,"Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold."
2 Chronicles,9,18,"There were six steps to the throne and a footstool in gold attached to the throne, and arms on each side of the seat, and two lions standing beside the arms."
2 Chronicles,9,19,Twelve lions were standing there on the six steps on the one side and on the other; nothing like it was made for any other kingdom.
2 Chronicles,9,20,"All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; silver was not considered valuable in the days of Solomon."
2 Chronicles,9,21,"For the king had ships which went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years the ships of Tarshish came bringing gold and silver, ivory and apes and peacocks."
2 Chronicles,9,22,So King Solomon became greater than all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
2 Chronicles,9,23,"And all the kings of the earth were seeking the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom which God had put in his heart."
2 Chronicles,9,24,"They brought every man his gift, articles of silver and gold, garments, weapons, spices, horses and mules, so much year by year."
2 Chronicles,9,25,"Now Solomon had 4,000 stalls for horses and chariots and 12,000 horsemen, and he stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,9,26,"He was the ruler over all the kings from the Euphrates River even to the land of the Philistines, and as far as the border of Egypt."
2 Chronicles,9,27,"The king made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem, and he made cedars as plentiful as sycamore trees that are in the lowland."
2 Chronicles,9,28,And they were bringing horses for Solomon from Egypt and from all countries.
2 Chronicles,9,29,"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, from first to last, are they not written in the records of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?"
2 Chronicles,9,30,Solomon reigned forty years in Jerusalem over all Israel.
2 Chronicles,9,31,And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David; and his son Rehoboam reigned in his place.
2 Chronicles,10,1,"Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king."
2 Chronicles,10,2,"When Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was in Egypt where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon), Jeroboam returned from Egypt."
2 Chronicles,10,3,"So they sent and summoned him. When Jeroboam and all Israel came, they spoke to Rehoboam, saying,"
2 Chronicles,10,4,"“Your father made our yoke hard; now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us, and we will serve you.”"
2 Chronicles,10,5,"He said to them, “Return to me again in three days.” So the people departed."
2 Chronicles,10,6,"Then King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon while he was still alive, saying, “How do you counsel me to answer this people?”"
2 Chronicles,10,7,"They spoke to him, saying, “If you will be kind to this people and please them and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.”"
2 Chronicles,10,8,"But he forsook the counsel of the elders which they had given him, and consulted with the young men who grew up with him and served him."
2 Chronicles,10,9,"So he said to them, “What counsel do you give that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten the yoke which your father put on us’?”"
2 Chronicles,10,10,"The young men who grew up with him spoke to him, saying, “Thus you shall say to the people who spoke to you, saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make it lighter for us.’ Thus you shall say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins!"
2 Chronicles,10,11,"Whereas my father loaded you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.’”"
2 Chronicles,10,12,"So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day as the king had directed, saying, “Return to me on the third day.”"
2 Chronicles,10,13,"The king answered them harshly, and King Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the elders."
2 Chronicles,10,14,"He spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.”"
2 Chronicles,10,15,"So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turn of events from God that the LORD might establish His word, which He spoke through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat."
2 Chronicles,10,16,"When all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them the people answered the king, saying, “What portion do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to your tents, O Israel; Now look after your own house, David.” So all Israel departed to their tents."
2 Chronicles,10,17,"But as for the sons of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them."
2 Chronicles,10,18,"Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the forced labor, and the sons of Israel stoned him to death. And King Rehoboam made haste to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,10,19,So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
2 Chronicles,11,1,"Now when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, 180,000 chosen men who were warriors, to fight against Israel to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam."
2 Chronicles,11,2,"But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,"
2 Chronicles,11,3,"“Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,"
2 Chronicles,11,4,"‘Thus says the LORD, “You shall not go up or fight against your relatives; return every man to his house, for this thing is from Me.”’” So they listened to the words of the LORD and returned from going against Jeroboam."
2 Chronicles,11,5,Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem and built cities for defense in Judah.
2 Chronicles,11,6,"Thus he built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,"
2 Chronicles,11,7,"Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam,"
2 Chronicles,11,8,"Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,"
2 Chronicles,11,9,"Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,"
2 Chronicles,11,10,"Zorah, Aijalon and Hebron, which are fortified cities in Judah and in Benjamin."
2 Chronicles,11,11,"He also strengthened the fortresses and put officers in them and stores of food, oil and wine."
2 Chronicles,11,12,He put shields and spears in every city and strengthened them greatly. So he held Judah and Benjamin.
2 Chronicles,11,13,"Moreover, the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel stood with him from all their districts."
2 Chronicles,11,14,"For the Levites left their pasture lands and their property and came to Judah and Jerusalem, for Jeroboam and his sons had excluded them from serving as priests to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,11,15,"He set up priests of his own for the high places, for the satyrs and for the calves which he had made."
2 Chronicles,11,16,"Those from all the tribes of Israel who set their hearts on seeking the LORD God of Israel followed them to Jerusalem, to sacrifice to the LORD God of their fathers."
2 Chronicles,11,17,"They strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam the son of Solomon for three years, for they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years."
2 Chronicles,11,18,"Then Rehoboam took as a wife Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse,"
2 Chronicles,11,19,"and she bore him sons: Jeush, Shemariah and Zaham."
2 Chronicles,11,20,"After her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom, and she bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza and Shelomith."
2 Chronicles,11,21,Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom more than all his other wives and concubines. For he had taken eighteen wives and sixty concubines and fathered twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.
2 Chronicles,11,22,"Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah as head and leader among his brothers, for he intended to make him king."
2 Chronicles,11,23,"He acted wisely and distributed some of his sons through all the territories of Judah and Benjamin to all the fortified cities, and he gave them food in abundance. And he sought many wives for them."
2 Chronicles,12,1,"When the kingdom of Rehoboam was established and strong, he and all Israel with him forsook the law of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,12,2,"And it came about in King Rehoboam’s fifth year, because they had been unfaithful to the LORD, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem"
2 Chronicles,12,3,"with 1,200 chariots and 60,000 horsemen. And the people who came with him from Egypt were without number: the Lubim, the Sukkiim and the Ethiopians."
2 Chronicles,12,4,He captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,12,5,"Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the princes of Judah who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and he said to them, “Thus says the LORD, ‘You have forsaken Me, so I also have forsaken you to Shishak.’”"
2 Chronicles,12,6,"So the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, “The LORD is righteous.”"
2 Chronicles,12,7,"When the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, “They have humbled themselves so I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some measure of deliverance, and My wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by means of Shishak."
2 Chronicles,12,8,But they will become his slaves so that they may learn the difference between My service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.”
2 Chronicles,12,9,"So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king’s palace. He took everything; he even took the golden shields which Solomon had made."
2 Chronicles,12,10,Then King Rehoboam made shields of bronze in their place and committed them to the care of the commanders of the guard who guarded the door of the king’s house.
2 Chronicles,12,11,"As often as the king entered the house of the LORD, the guards came and carried them and then brought them back into the guards’ room."
2 Chronicles,12,12,"And when he humbled himself, the anger of the LORD turned away from him, so as not to destroy him completely; and also conditions were good in Judah."
2 Chronicles,12,13,"So King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned. Now Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen from all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there. And his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess."
2 Chronicles,12,14,He did evil because he did not set his heart to seek the LORD.
2 Chronicles,12,15,"Now the acts of Rehoboam, from first to last, are they not written in the records of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, according to genealogical enrollment? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually."
2 Chronicles,12,16,And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David; and his son Abijah became king in his place.
2 Chronicles,13,1,"In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah became king over Judah."
2 Chronicles,13,2,He reigned three years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. Now there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
2 Chronicles,13,3,"Abijah began the battle with an army of valiant warriors, 400,000 chosen men, while Jeroboam drew up in battle formation against him with 800,000 chosen men who were valiant warriors."
2 Chronicles,13,4,"Then Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, “Listen to me, Jeroboam and all Israel:"
2 Chronicles,13,5,Do you not know that the LORD God of Israel gave the rule over Israel forever to David and his sons by a covenant of salt?
2 Chronicles,13,6,"Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up and rebelled against his master,"
2 Chronicles,13,7,"and worthless men gathered about him, scoundrels, who proved too strong for Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, when he was young and timid and could not hold his own against them."
2 Chronicles,13,8,"“So now you intend to resist the kingdom of the LORD through the sons of David, being a great multitude and having with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made for gods for you."
2 Chronicles,13,9,"Have you not driven out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron and the Levites, and made for yourselves priests like the peoples of other lands? Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams, even he may become a priest of what are no gods."
2 Chronicles,13,10,"But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken Him; and the sons of Aaron are ministering to the LORD as priests, and the Levites attend to their work."
2 Chronicles,13,11,"Every morning and evening they burn to the LORD burnt offerings and fragrant incense, and the showbread is set on the clean table, and the golden lampstand with its lamps is ready to light every evening; for we keep the charge of the LORD our God, but you have forsaken Him."
2 Chronicles,13,12,"Now behold, God is with us at our head and His priests with the signal trumpets to sound the alarm against you. O sons of Israel, do not fight against the LORD God of your fathers, for you will not succeed.”"
2 Chronicles,13,13,"But Jeroboam had set an ambush to come from the rear, so that Israel was in front of Judah and the ambush was behind them."
2 Chronicles,13,14,"When Judah turned around, behold, they were attacked both front and rear; so they cried to the LORD, and the priests blew the trumpets."
2 Chronicles,13,15,"Then the men of Judah raised a war cry, and when the men of Judah raised the war cry, then it was that God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah."
2 Chronicles,13,16,"When the sons of Israel fled before Judah, God gave them into their hand."
2 Chronicles,13,17,"Abijah and his people defeated them with a great slaughter, so that 500,000 chosen men of Israel fell slain."
2 Chronicles,13,18,"Thus the sons of Israel were subdued at that time, and the sons of Judah conquered because they trusted in the LORD, the God of their fathers."
2 Chronicles,13,19,"Abijah pursued Jeroboam and captured from him several cities, Bethel with its villages, Jeshanah with its villages and Ephron with its villages."
2 Chronicles,13,20,Jeroboam did not again recover strength in the days of Abijah; and the LORD struck him and he died.
2 Chronicles,13,21,"But Abijah became powerful; and took fourteen wives to himself, and became the father of twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters."
2 Chronicles,13,22,"Now the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways and his words are written in the treatise of the prophet Iddo."
2 Chronicles,14,1,"So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David, and his son Asa became king in his place. The land was undisturbed for ten years during his days."
2 Chronicles,14,2,"Asa did good and right in the sight of the LORD his God,"
2 Chronicles,14,3,"for he removed the foreign altars and high places, tore down the sacred pillars, cut down the Asherim,"
2 Chronicles,14,4,and commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers and to observe the law and the commandment.
2 Chronicles,14,5,He also removed the high places and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah. And the kingdom was undisturbed under him.
2 Chronicles,14,6,"He built fortified cities in Judah, since the land was undisturbed, and there was no one at war with him during those years, because the LORD had given him rest."
2 Chronicles,14,7,"For he said to Judah, “Let us build these cities and surround them with walls and towers, gates and bars. The land is still ours because we have sought the LORD our God; we have sought Him, and He has given us rest on every side.” So they built and prospered."
2 Chronicles,14,8,"Now Asa had an army of 300,000 from Judah, bearing large shields and spears, and 280,000 from Benjamin, bearing shields and wielding bows; all of them were valiant warriors."
2 Chronicles,14,9,"Now Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and 300 chariots, and he came to Mareshah."
2 Chronicles,14,10,"So Asa went out to meet him, and they drew up in battle formation in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah."
2 Chronicles,14,11,"Then Asa called to the LORD his God and said, “LORD, there is no one besides You to help in the battle between the powerful and those who have no strength; so help us, O LORD our God, for we trust in You, and in Your name have come against this multitude. O LORD, You are our God; let not man prevail against You.”"
2 Chronicles,14,12,"So the LORD routed the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah, and the Ethiopians fled."
2 Chronicles,14,13,"Asa and the people who were with him pursued them as far as Gerar; and so many Ethiopians fell that they could not recover, for they were shattered before the LORD and before His army. And they carried away very much plunder."
2 Chronicles,14,14,"They destroyed all the cities around Gerar, for the dread of the LORD had fallen on them; and they despoiled all the cities, for there was much plunder in them."
2 Chronicles,14,15,"They also struck down those who owned livestock, and they carried away large numbers of sheep and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,15,1,"Now the Spirit of God came on Azariah the son of Oded,"
2 Chronicles,15,2,"and he went out to meet Asa and said to him, “Listen to me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: the LORD is with you when you are with Him. And if you seek Him, He will let you find Him; but if you forsake Him, He will forsake you."
2 Chronicles,15,3,For many days Israel was without the true God and without a teaching priest and without law.
2 Chronicles,15,4,"But in their distress they turned to the LORD God of Israel, and they sought Him, and He let them find Him."
2 Chronicles,15,5,"In those times there was no peace to him who went out or to him who came in, for many disturbances afflicted all the inhabitants of the lands."
2 Chronicles,15,6,"Nation was crushed by nation, and city by city, for God troubled them with every kind of distress."
2 Chronicles,15,7,"But you, be strong and do not lose courage, for there is reward for your work.”"
2 Chronicles,15,8,"Now when Asa heard these words and the prophecy which Azariah the son of Oded the prophet spoke, he took courage and removed the abominable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities which he had captured in the hill country of Ephraim. He then restored the altar of the LORD which was in front of the porch of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,15,9,"He gathered all Judah and Benjamin and those from Ephraim, Manasseh and Simeon who resided with them, for many defected to him from Israel when they saw that the LORD his God was with him."
2 Chronicles,15,10,So they assembled at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign.
2 Chronicles,15,11,"They sacrificed to the LORD that day 700 oxen and 7,000 sheep from the spoil they had brought."
2 Chronicles,15,12,They entered into the covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and soul;
2 Chronicles,15,13,"and whoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, man or woman."
2 Chronicles,15,14,"Moreover, they made an oath to the LORD with a loud voice, with shouting, with trumpets and with horns."
2 Chronicles,15,15,"All Judah rejoiced concerning the oath, for they had sworn with their whole heart and had sought Him earnestly, and He let them find Him. So the LORD gave them rest on every side."
2 Chronicles,15,16,"He also removed Maacah, the mother of King Asa, from the position of queen mother, because she had made a horrid image as an Asherah, and Asa cut down her horrid image, crushed it and burned it at the brook Kidron."
2 Chronicles,15,17,But the high places were not removed from Israel; nevertheless Asa’s heart was blameless all his days.
2 Chronicles,15,18,He brought into the house of God the dedicated things of his father and his own dedicated things: silver and gold and utensils.
2 Chronicles,15,19,And there was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign.
2 Chronicles,16,1,In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah and fortified Ramah in order to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to Asa king of Judah.
2 Chronicles,16,2,"Then Asa brought out silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of the LORD and the king’s house, and sent them to Ben-hadad king of Aram, who lived in Damascus, saying,"
2 Chronicles,16,3,"“Let there be a treaty between you and me, as between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent you silver and gold; go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so that he will withdraw from me.”"
2 Chronicles,16,4,"So Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, and they conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim and all the store cities of Naphtali."
2 Chronicles,16,5,"When Baasha heard of it, he ceased fortifying Ramah and stopped his work."
2 Chronicles,16,6,"Then King Asa brought all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber with which Baasha had been building, and with them he fortified Geba and Mizpah."
2 Chronicles,16,7,"At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him, “Because you have relied on the king of Aram and have not relied on the LORD your God, therefore the army of the king of Aram has escaped out of your hand."
2 Chronicles,16,8,"Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim an immense army with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet because you relied on the LORD, He delivered them into your hand."
2 Chronicles,16,9,"For the eyes of the LORD move to and fro throughout the earth that He may strongly support those whose heart is completely His. You have acted foolishly in this. Indeed, from now on you will surely have wars.”"
2 Chronicles,16,10,"Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him in prison, for he was enraged at him for this. And Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time."
2 Chronicles,16,11,"Now, the acts of Asa from first to last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel."
2 Chronicles,16,12,"In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa became diseased in his feet. His disease was severe, yet even in his disease he did not seek the LORD, but the physicians."
2 Chronicles,16,13,"So Asa slept with his fathers, having died in the forty-first year of his reign."
2 Chronicles,16,14,"They buried him in his own tomb which he had cut out for himself in the city of David, and they laid him in the resting place which he had filled with spices of various kinds blended by the perfumers’ art; and they made a very great fire for him."
2 Chronicles,17,1,"Jehoshaphat his son then became king in his place, and made his position over Israel firm."
2 Chronicles,17,2,"He placed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim which Asa his father had captured."
2 Chronicles,17,3,"The LORD was with Jehoshaphat because he followed the example of his father David’s earlier days and did not seek the Baals,"
2 Chronicles,17,4,"but sought the God of his father, followed His commandments, and did not act as Israel did."
2 Chronicles,17,5,"So the LORD established the kingdom in his control, and all Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had great riches and honor."
2 Chronicles,17,6,He took great pride in the ways of the LORD and again removed the high places and the Asherim from Judah.
2 Chronicles,17,7,"Then in the third year of his reign he sent his officials, Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;"
2 Chronicles,17,8,"and with them the Levites, Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah and Tobadonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests."
2 Chronicles,17,9,"They taught in Judah, having the book of the law of the LORD with them; and they went throughout all the cities of Judah and taught among the people."
2 Chronicles,17,10,"Now the dread of the LORD was on all the kingdoms of the lands which were around Judah, so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat."
2 Chronicles,17,11,"Some of the Philistines brought gifts and silver as tribute to Jehoshaphat; the Arabians also brought him flocks, 7,700 rams and 7,700 male goats."
2 Chronicles,17,12,"So Jehoshaphat grew greater and greater, and he built fortresses and store cities in Judah."
2 Chronicles,17,13,"He had large supplies in the cities of Judah, and warriors, valiant men, in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,17,14,"This was their muster according to their fathers’ households: of Judah, commanders of thousands, Adnah was the commander, and with him 300,000 valiant warriors;"
2 Chronicles,17,15,"and next to him was Johanan the commander, and with him 280,000;"
2 Chronicles,17,16,"and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who volunteered for the LORD, and with him 200,000 valiant warriors;"
2 Chronicles,17,17,"and of Benjamin, Eliada a valiant warrior, and with him 200,000 armed with bow and shield;"
2 Chronicles,17,18,"and next to him Jehozabad, and with him 180,000 equipped for war."
2 Chronicles,17,19,"These are they who served the king, apart from those whom the king put in the fortified cities through all Judah."
2 Chronicles,18,1,Now Jehoshaphat had great riches and honor; and he allied himself by marriage with Ahab.
2 Chronicles,18,2,"Some years later he went down to visit Ahab at Samaria. And Ahab slaughtered many sheep and oxen for him and the people who were with him, and induced him to go up against Ramoth-gilead."
2 Chronicles,18,3,"Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me against Ramoth-gilead?” And he said to him, “I am as you are, and my people as your people, and we will be with you in the battle.”"
2 Chronicles,18,4,"Moreover, Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire first for the word of the LORD.”"
2 Chronicles,18,5,"Then the king of Israel assembled the prophets, four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I refrain?” And they said, “Go up, for God will give it into the hand of the king.”"
2 Chronicles,18,6,"But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not yet a prophet of the LORD here that we may inquire of him?”"
2 Chronicles,18,7,"The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD, but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me but always evil. He is Micaiah, son of Imla.” But Jehoshaphat said, “Let not the king say so.”"
2 Chronicles,18,8,"Then the king of Israel called an officer and said, “Bring quickly Micaiah, Imla’s son.”"
2 Chronicles,18,9,"Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they were sitting at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them."
2 Chronicles,18,10,"Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made horns of iron for himself and said, “Thus says the LORD, ‘With these you shall gore the Arameans until they are consumed.’”"
2 Chronicles,18,11,"All the prophets were prophesying thus, saying, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and succeed, for the LORD will give it into the hand of the king.”"
2 Chronicles,18,12,"Then the messenger who went to summon Micaiah spoke to him saying, “Behold, the words of the prophets are uniformly favorable to the king. So please let your word be like one of them and speak favorably.”"
2 Chronicles,18,13,"But Micaiah said, “As the LORD lives, what my God says, that I will speak.”"
2 Chronicles,18,14,"When he came to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I refrain?” He said, “Go up and succeed, for they will be given into your hand.”"
2 Chronicles,18,15,"Then the king said to him, “How many times must I adjure you to speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?”"
2 Chronicles,18,16,"So he said, “I saw all Israel Scattered on the mountains, Like sheep which have no shepherd; And the LORD said, ‘These have no master. Let each of them return to his house in peace.’”"
2 Chronicles,18,17,"Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?”"
2 Chronicles,18,18,"Micaiah said, “Therefore, hear the word of the LORD. I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing on His right and on His left."
2 Chronicles,18,19,"The LORD said, ‘Who will entice Ahab king of Israel to go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’ And one said this while another said that."
2 Chronicles,18,20,"Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD and said, ‘I will entice him.’ And the LORD said to him, ‘How?’"
2 Chronicles,18,21,"He said, ‘I will go and be a deceiving spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ Then He said, ‘You are to entice him and prevail also. Go and do so.’"
2 Chronicles,18,22,"Now therefore, behold, the LORD has put a deceiving spirit in the mouth of these your prophets, for the LORD has proclaimed disaster against you.”"
2 Chronicles,18,23,"Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, “How did the Spirit of the LORD pass from me to speak to you?”"
2 Chronicles,18,24,"Micaiah said, “Behold, you will see on that day when you enter an inner room to hide yourself.”"
2 Chronicles,18,25,"Then the king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son;"
2 Chronicles,18,26,"and say, ‘Thus says the king, “Put this man in prison and feed him sparingly with bread and water until I return safely.”’”"
2 Chronicles,18,27,"Micaiah said, “If you indeed return safely, the LORD has not spoken by me.” And he said, “Listen, all you people.”"
2 Chronicles,18,28,So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up against Ramoth-gilead.
2 Chronicles,18,29,"The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you put on your robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle."
2 Chronicles,18,30,"Now the king of Aram had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, “Do not fight with small or great, but with the king of Israel alone.”"
2 Chronicles,18,31,"So when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “It is the king of Israel,” and they turned aside to fight against him. But Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him, and God diverted them from him."
2 Chronicles,18,32,"When the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him."
2 Chronicles,18,33,"A certain man drew his bow at random and struck the king of Israel in a joint of the armor. So he said to the driver of the chariot, “Turn around and take me out of the fight, for I am severely wounded.”"
2 Chronicles,18,34,"The battle raged that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot in front of the Arameans until the evening; and at sunset he died."
2 Chronicles,19,1,Then Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned in safety to his house in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,19,2,"Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to King Jehoshaphat, “Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD and so bring wrath on yourself from the LORD?"
2 Chronicles,19,3,"But there is some good in you, for you have removed the Asheroth from the land and you have set your heart to seek God.”"
2 Chronicles,19,4,"So Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem and went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim and brought them back to the LORD, the God of their fathers."
2 Chronicles,19,5,"He appointed judges in the land in all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city."
2 Chronicles,19,6,"He said to the judges, “Consider what you are doing, for you do not judge for man but for the LORD who is with you when you render judgment."
2 Chronicles,19,7,"Now then let the fear of the LORD be upon you; be very careful what you do, for the LORD our God will have no part in unrighteousness or partiality or the taking of a bribe.”"
2 Chronicles,19,8,"In Jerusalem also Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites and priests, and some of the heads of the fathers’ households of Israel, for the judgment of the LORD and to judge disputes among the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,19,9,"Then he charged them saying, “Thus you shall do in the fear of the LORD, faithfully and wholeheartedly."
2 Chronicles,19,10,"Whenever any dispute comes to you from your brethren who live in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, you shall warn them so that they may not be guilty before the LORD, and wrath may not come on you and your brethren. Thus you shall do and you will not be guilty."
2 Chronicles,19,11,"Behold, Amariah the chief priest will be over you in all that pertains to the LORD, and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all that pertains to the king. Also the Levites shall be officers before you. Act resolutely, and the LORD be with the upright.”"
2 Chronicles,20,1,"Now it came about after this that the sons of Moab and the sons of Ammon, together with some of the Meunites, came to make war against Jehoshaphat."
2 Chronicles,20,2,"Then some came and reported to Jehoshaphat, saying, “A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea, out of Aram and behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar (that is Engedi).”"
2 Chronicles,20,3,"Jehoshaphat was afraid and turned his attention to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah."
2 Chronicles,20,4,So Judah gathered together to seek help from the LORD; they even came from all the cities of Judah to seek the LORD.
2 Chronicles,20,5,"Then Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD before the new court,"
2 Chronicles,20,6,"and he said, “O LORD, the God of our fathers, are You not God in the heavens? And are You not ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations? Power and might are in Your hand so that no one can stand against You."
2 Chronicles,20,7,"Did You not, O our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel and give it to the descendants of Abraham Your friend forever?"
2 Chronicles,20,8,"They have lived in it, and have built You a sanctuary there for Your name, saying,"
2 Chronicles,20,9,"‘Should evil come upon us, the sword, or judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house and before You (for Your name is in this house) and cry to You in our distress, and You will hear and deliver us.’"
2 Chronicles,20,10,"Now behold, the sons of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom You did not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt (they turned aside from them and did not destroy them),"
2 Chronicles,20,11,see how they are rewarding us by coming to drive us out from Your possession which You have given us as an inheritance.
2 Chronicles,20,12,"O our God, will You not judge them? For we are powerless before this great multitude who are coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are on You.”"
2 Chronicles,20,13,"All Judah was standing before the LORD, with their infants, their wives and their children."
2 Chronicles,20,14,"Then in the midst of the assembly the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite of the sons of Asaph;"
2 Chronicles,20,15,"and he said, “Listen, all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and King Jehoshaphat: thus says the LORD to you, ‘Do not fear or be dismayed because of this great multitude, for the battle is not yours but God’s."
2 Chronicles,20,16,"Tomorrow go down against them. Behold, they will come up by the ascent of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the valley in front of the wilderness of Jeruel."
2 Chronicles,20,17,"You need not fight in this battle; station yourselves, stand and see the salvation of the LORD on your behalf, O Judah and Jerusalem.’ Do not fear or be dismayed; tomorrow go out to face them, for the LORD is with you.”"
2 Chronicles,20,18,"Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before the LORD, worshiping the LORD."
2 Chronicles,20,19,"The Levites, from the sons of the Kohathites and of the sons of the Korahites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel, with a very loud voice."
2 Chronicles,20,20,"They rose early in the morning and went out to the wilderness of Tekoa; and when they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Listen to me, O Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, put your trust in the LORD your God and you will be established. Put your trust in His prophets and succeed.”"
2 Chronicles,20,21,"When he had consulted with the people, he appointed those who sang to the LORD and those who praised Him in holy attire, as they went out before the army and said, “Give thanks to the LORD, for His lovingkindness is everlasting.”"
2 Chronicles,20,22,"When they began singing and praising, the LORD set ambushes against the sons of Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; so they were routed."
2 Chronicles,20,23,"For the sons of Ammon and Moab rose up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir destroying them completely; and when they had finished with the inhabitants of Seir, they helped to destroy one another."
2 Chronicles,20,24,"When Judah came to the lookout of the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude, and behold, they were corpses lying on the ground, and no one had escaped."
2 Chronicles,20,25,"When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their spoil, they found much among them, including goods, garments and valuable things which they took for themselves, more than they could carry. And they were three days taking the spoil because there was so much."
2 Chronicles,20,26,"Then on the fourth day they assembled in the valley of Beracah, for there they blessed the LORD. Therefore they have named that place “The Valley of Beracah” until today."
2 Chronicles,20,27,"Every man of Judah and Jerusalem returned with Jehoshaphat at their head, returning to Jerusalem with joy, for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies."
2 Chronicles,20,28,"They came to Jerusalem with harps, lyres and trumpets to the house of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,20,29,And the dread of God was on all the kingdoms of the lands when they heard that the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel.
2 Chronicles,20,30,"So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was at peace, for his God gave him rest on all sides."
2 Chronicles,20,31,"Now Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. And his mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi."
2 Chronicles,20,32,"He walked in the way of his father Asa and did not depart from it, doing right in the sight of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,20,33,"The high places, however, were not removed; the people had not yet directed their hearts to the God of their fathers."
2 Chronicles,20,34,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first to last, behold, they are written in the annals of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is recorded in the Book of the Kings of Israel."
2 Chronicles,20,35,After this Jehoshaphat king of Judah allied himself with Ahaziah king of Israel. He acted wickedly in so doing.
2 Chronicles,20,36,"So he allied himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish, and they made the ships in Ezion-geber."
2 Chronicles,20,37,"Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat saying, “Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah, the LORD has destroyed your works.” So the ships were broken and could not go to Tarshish."
2 Chronicles,21,1,"Then Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Jehoram his son became king in his place."
2 Chronicles,21,2,"He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azaryahu, Michael and Shephatiah. All these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel."
2 Chronicles,21,3,"Their father gave them many gifts of silver, gold and precious things, with fortified cities in Judah, but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram because he was the firstborn."
2 Chronicles,21,4,"Now when Jehoram had taken over the kingdom of his father and made himself secure, he killed all his brothers with the sword, and some of the rulers of Israel also."
2 Chronicles,21,5,"Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,21,6,"He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab did (for Ahab’s daughter was his wife), and he did evil in the sight of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,21,7,"Yet the LORD was not willing to destroy the house of David because of the covenant which He had made with David, and since He had promised to give a lamp to him and his sons forever."
2 Chronicles,21,8,In his days Edom revolted against the rule of Judah and set up a king over themselves.
2 Chronicles,21,9,Then Jehoram crossed over with his commanders and all his chariots with him. And he arose by night and struck down the Edomites who were surrounding him and the commanders of the chariots.
2 Chronicles,21,10,"So Edom revolted against Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time against his rule, because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers."
2 Chronicles,21,11,"Moreover, he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot and led Judah astray."
2 Chronicles,21,12,"Then a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet saying, “Thus says the LORD God of your father David, ‘Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father and the ways of Asa king of Judah,"
2 Chronicles,21,13,"but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot as the house of Ahab played the harlot, and you have also killed your brothers, your own family, who were better than you,"
2 Chronicles,21,14,"behold, the LORD is going to strike your people, your sons, your wives and all your possessions with a great calamity;"
2 Chronicles,21,15,"and you will suffer severe sickness, a disease of your bowels, until your bowels come out because of the sickness, day by day.’”"
2 Chronicles,21,16,Then the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and the Arabs who bordered the Ethiopians;
2 Chronicles,21,17,"and they came against Judah and invaded it, and carried away all the possessions found in the king’s house together with his sons and his wives, so that no son was left to him except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons."
2 Chronicles,21,18,So after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable sickness.
2 Chronicles,21,19,"Now it came about in the course of time, at the end of two years, that his bowels came out because of his sickness and he died in great pain. And his people made no fire for him like the fire for his fathers."
2 Chronicles,21,20,"He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years; and he departed with no one’s regret, and they buried him in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings."
2 Chronicles,22,1,"Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king in his place, for the band of men who came with the Arabs to the camp had slain all the older sons. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign."
2 Chronicles,22,2,"Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Athaliah, the granddaughter of Omri."
2 Chronicles,22,3,"He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly."
2 Chronicles,22,4,"He did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab, for they were his counselors after the death of his father, to his destruction."
2 Chronicles,22,5,"He also walked according to their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to wage war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead. But the Arameans wounded Joram."
2 Chronicles,22,6,"So he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had inflicted on him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. And Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram king of Judah, went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick."
2 Chronicles,22,7,"Now the destruction of Ahaziah was from God, in that he went to Joram. For when he came, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab."
2 Chronicles,22,8,"It came about when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he found the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s brothers ministering to Ahaziah, and slew them."
2 Chronicles,22,9,"He also sought Ahaziah, and they caught him while he was hiding in Samaria; they brought him to Jehu, put him to death and buried him. For they said, “He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart.” So there was no one of the house of Ahaziah to retain the power of the kingdom."
2 Chronicles,22,10,"Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she rose and destroyed all the royal offspring of the house of Judah."
2 Chronicles,22,11,"But Jehoshabeath the king’s daughter took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king’s sons who were being put to death, and placed him and his nurse in the bedroom. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah so that she would not put him to death."
2 Chronicles,22,12,He was hidden with them in the house of God six years while Athaliah reigned over the land.
2 Chronicles,23,1,"Now in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took captains of hundreds: Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Johanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, and they entered into a covenant with him."
2 Chronicles,23,2,"They went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah, and the heads of the fathers’ households of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,23,3,"Then all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And Jehoiada said to them, “Behold, the king’s son shall reign, as the LORD has spoken concerning the sons of David."
2 Chronicles,23,4,"This is the thing which you shall do: one third of you, of the priests and Levites who come in on the sabbath, shall be gatekeepers,"
2 Chronicles,23,5,"and one third shall be at the king’s house, and a third at the Gate of the Foundation; and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,23,6,"But let no one enter the house of the LORD except the priests and the ministering Levites; they may enter, for they are holy. And let all the people keep the charge of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,23,7,"The Levites will surround the king, each man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever enters the house, let him be killed. Thus be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out.”"
2 Chronicles,23,8,"So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. And each one of them took his men who were to come in on the sabbath, with those who were to go out on the sabbath, for Jehoiada the priest did not dismiss any of the divisions."
2 Chronicles,23,9,"Then Jehoiada the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and the large and small shields which had been King David’s, which were in the house of God."
2 Chronicles,23,10,"He stationed all the people, each man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, by the altar and by the house, around the king."
2 Chronicles,23,11,"Then they brought out the king’s son and put the crown on him, and gave him the testimony and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him and said, “Long live the king!”"
2 Chronicles,23,12,"When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came into the house of the LORD to the people."
2 Chronicles,23,13,"She looked, and behold, the king was standing by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpeters were beside the king. And all the people of the land rejoiced and blew trumpets, the singers with their musical instruments leading the praise. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and said, “Treason! Treason!”"
2 Chronicles,23,14,"Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were appointed over the army and said to them, “Bring her out between the ranks; and whoever follows her, put to death with the sword.” For the priest said, “Let her not be put to death in the house of the LORD.”"
2 Chronicles,23,15,"So they seized her, and when she arrived at the entrance of the Horse Gate of the king’s house, they put her to death there."
2 Chronicles,23,16,"Then Jehoiada made a covenant between himself and all the people and the king, that they would be the LORD’S people."
2 Chronicles,23,17,"And all the people went to the house of Baal and tore it down, and they broke in pieces his altars and his images, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars."
2 Chronicles,23,18,"Moreover, Jehoiada placed the offices of the house of the LORD under the authority of the Levitical priests, whom David had assigned over the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses—with rejoicing and singing according to the order of David."
2 Chronicles,23,19,"He stationed the gatekeepers of the house of the LORD, so that no one would enter who was in any way unclean."
2 Chronicles,23,20,"He took the captains of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people and all the people of the land, and brought the king down from the house of the LORD, and came through the upper gate to the king’s house. And they placed the king upon the royal throne."
2 Chronicles,23,21,So all of the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet. For they had put Athaliah to death with the sword.
2 Chronicles,24,1,"Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Zibiah from Beersheba."
2 Chronicles,24,2,Joash did what was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
2 Chronicles,24,3,"Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he became the father of sons and daughters."
2 Chronicles,24,4,Now it came about after this that Joash decided to restore the house of the LORD.
2 Chronicles,24,5,"He gathered the priests and Levites and said to them, “Go out to the cities of Judah and collect money from all Israel to repair the house of your God annually, and you shall do the matter quickly.” But the Levites did not act quickly."
2 Chronicles,24,6,"So the king summoned Jehoiada the chief priest and said to him, “Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and from Jerusalem the levy fixed by Moses the servant of the LORD on the congregation of Israel for the tent of the testimony?”"
2 Chronicles,24,7,For the sons of the wicked Athaliah had broken into the house of God and even used the holy things of the house of the LORD for the Baals.
2 Chronicles,24,8,"So the king commanded, and they made a chest and set it outside by the gate of the house of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,24,9,They made a proclamation in Judah and Jerusalem to bring to the LORD the levy fixed by Moses the servant of God on Israel in the wilderness.
2 Chronicles,24,10,All the officers and all the people rejoiced and brought in their levies and dropped them into the chest until they had finished.
2 Chronicles,24,11,"It came about whenever the chest was brought in to the king’s officer by the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, then the king’s scribe and the chief priest’s officer would come, empty the chest, take it, and return it to its place. Thus they did daily and collected much money."
2 Chronicles,24,12,"The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the house of the LORD; and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of the LORD, and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the house of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,24,13,"So the workmen labored, and the repair work progressed in their hands, and they restored the house of God according to its specifications and strengthened it."
2 Chronicles,24,14,"When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada; and it was made into utensils for the house of the LORD, utensils for the service and the burnt offering, and pans and utensils of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada."
2 Chronicles,24,15,Now when Jehoiada reached a ripe old age he died; he was one hundred and thirty years old at his death.
2 Chronicles,24,16,"They buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done well in Israel and to God and His house."
2 Chronicles,24,17,"But after the death of Jehoiada the officials of Judah came and bowed down to the king, and the king listened to them."
2 Chronicles,24,18,"They abandoned the house of the LORD, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols; so wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their guilt."
2 Chronicles,24,19,"Yet He sent prophets to them to bring them back to the LORD; though they testified against them, they would not listen."
2 Chronicles,24,20,"Then the Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people and said to them, “Thus God has said, ‘Why do you transgress the commandments of the LORD and do not prosper? Because you have forsaken the LORD, He has also forsaken you.’”"
2 Chronicles,24,21,So they conspired against him and at the command of the king they stoned him to death in the court of the house of the LORD.
2 Chronicles,24,22,"Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which his father Jehoiada had shown him, but he murdered his son. And as he died he said, “May the LORD see and avenge!”"
2 Chronicles,24,23,"Now it happened at the turn of the year that the army of the Arameans came up against him; and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, destroyed all the officials of the people from among the people, and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus."
2 Chronicles,24,24,"Indeed the army of the Arameans came with a small number of men; yet the LORD delivered a very great army into their hands, because they had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers. Thus they executed judgment on Joash."
2 Chronicles,24,25,"When they had departed from him (for they left him very sick), his own servants conspired against him because of the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest, and murdered him on his bed. So he died, and they buried him in the city of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings."
2 Chronicles,24,26,"Now these are those who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess."
2 Chronicles,24,27,"As to his sons and the many oracles against him and the rebuilding of the house of God, behold, they are written in the treatise of the Book of the Kings. Then Amaziah his son became king in his place."
2 Chronicles,25,1,"Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,25,2,"He did right in the sight of the LORD, yet not with a whole heart."
2 Chronicles,25,3,"Now it came about as soon as the kingdom was firmly in his grasp, that he killed his servants who had slain his father the king."
2 Chronicles,25,4,"However, he did not put their children to death, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, which the LORD commanded, saying, “Fathers shall not be put to death for sons, nor sons be put to death for fathers, but each shall be put to death for his own sin.”"
2 Chronicles,25,5,"Moreover, Amaziah assembled Judah and appointed them according to their fathers’ households under commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds throughout Judah and Benjamin; and he took a census of those from twenty years old and upward and found them to be 300,000 choice men, able to go to war and handle spear and shield."
2 Chronicles,25,6,"He hired also 100,000 valiant warriors out of Israel for one hundred talents of silver."
2 Chronicles,25,7,"But a man of God came to him saying, “O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for the LORD is not with Israel nor with any of the sons of Ephraim."
2 Chronicles,25,8,"But if you do go, do it, be strong for the battle; yet God will bring you down before the enemy, for God has power to help and to bring down.”"
2 Chronicles,25,9,"Amaziah said to the man of God, “But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the troops of Israel?” And the man of God answered, “The LORD has much more to give you than this.”"
2 Chronicles,25,10,"Then Amaziah dismissed them, the troops which came to him from Ephraim, to go home; so their anger burned against Judah and they returned home in fierce anger."
2 Chronicles,25,11,"Now Amaziah strengthened himself and led his people forth, and went to the Valley of Salt and struck down 10,000 of the sons of Seir."
2 Chronicles,25,12,"The sons of Judah also captured 10,000 alive and brought them to the top of the cliff and threw them down from the top of the cliff, so that they were all dashed to pieces."
2 Chronicles,25,13,"But the troops whom Amaziah sent back from going with him to battle, raided the cities of Judah, from Samaria to Beth-horon, and struck down 3,000 of them and plundered much spoil."
2 Chronicles,25,14,"Now after Amaziah came from slaughtering the Edomites, he brought the gods of the sons of Seir, set them up as his gods, bowed down before them and burned incense to them."
2 Chronicles,25,15,"Then the anger of the LORD burned against Amaziah, and He sent him a prophet who said to him, “Why have you sought the gods of the people who have not delivered their own people from your hand?”"
2 Chronicles,25,16,"As he was talking with him, the king said to him, “Have we appointed you a royal counselor? Stop! Why should you be struck down?” Then the prophet stopped and said, “I know that God has planned to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel.”"
2 Chronicles,25,17,"Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, the king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us face each other.”"
2 Chronicles,25,18,"Joash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The thorn bush which was in Lebanon sent to the cedar which was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.’ But there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon and trampled the thorn bush."
2 Chronicles,25,19,"You said, ‘Behold, you have defeated Edom.’ And your heart has become proud in boasting. Now stay at home; for why should you provoke trouble so that you, even you, would fall and Judah with you?”"
2 Chronicles,25,20,"But Amaziah would not listen, for it was from God, that He might deliver them into the hand of Joash because they had sought the gods of Edom."
2 Chronicles,25,21,"So Joash king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth-shemesh, which belonged to Judah."
2 Chronicles,25,22,"Judah was defeated by Israel, and they fled each to his tent."
2 Chronicles,25,23,"Then Joash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem and tore down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, 400 cubits."
2 Chronicles,25,24,"He took all the gold and silver and all the utensils which were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria."
2 Chronicles,25,25,"And Amaziah, the son of Joash king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joash, son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel."
2 Chronicles,25,26,"Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, from first to last, behold, are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel?"
2 Chronicles,25,27,"From the time that Amaziah turned away from following the LORD they conspired against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there."
2 Chronicles,25,28,Then they brought him on horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
2 Chronicles,26,1,"And all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah."
2 Chronicles,26,2,He built Eloth and restored it to Judah after the king slept with his fathers.
2 Chronicles,26,3,"Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Jechiliah of Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,26,4,He did right in the sight of the LORD according to all that his father Amaziah had done.
2 Chronicles,26,5,"He continued to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding through the vision of God; and as long as he sought the LORD, God prospered him."
2 Chronicles,26,6,"Now he went out and warred against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath and the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in the area of Ashdod and among the Philistines."
2 Chronicles,26,7,"God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians who lived in Gur-baal, and the Meunites."
2 Chronicles,26,8,"The Ammonites also gave tribute to Uzziah, and his fame extended to the border of Egypt, for he became very strong."
2 Chronicles,26,9,"Moreover, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate and at the Valley Gate and at the corner buttress and fortified them."
2 Chronicles,26,10,"He built towers in the wilderness and hewed many cisterns, for he had much livestock, both in the lowland and in the plain. He also had plowmen and vinedressers in the hill country and the fertile fields, for he loved the soil."
2 Chronicles,26,11,"Moreover, Uzziah had an army ready for battle, which entered combat by divisions according to the number of their muster, prepared by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the official, under the direction of Hananiah, one of the king’s officers."
2 Chronicles,26,12,"The total number of the heads of the households, of valiant warriors, was 2,600."
2 Chronicles,26,13,"Under their direction was an elite army of 307,500, who could wage war with great power, to help the king against the enemy."
2 Chronicles,26,14,"Moreover, Uzziah prepared for all the army shields, spears, helmets, body armor, bows and sling stones."
2 Chronicles,26,15,"In Jerusalem he made engines of war invented by skillful men to be on the towers and on the corners for the purpose of shooting arrows and great stones. Hence his fame spread afar, for he was marvelously helped until he was strong."
2 Chronicles,26,16,"But when he became strong, his heart was so proud that he acted corruptly, and he was unfaithful to the LORD his God, for he entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense."
2 Chronicles,26,17,"Then Azariah the priest entered after him and with him eighty priests of the LORD, valiant men."
2 Chronicles,26,18,"They opposed Uzziah the king and said to him, “It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron who are consecrated to burn incense. Get out of the sanctuary, for you have been unfaithful and will have no honor from the LORD God.”"
2 Chronicles,26,19,"But Uzziah, with a censer in his hand for burning incense, was enraged; and while he was enraged with the priests, the leprosy broke out on his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, beside the altar of incense."
2 Chronicles,26,20,"Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him, and behold, he was leprous on his forehead; and they hurried him out of there, and he himself also hastened to get out because the LORD had smitten him."
2 Chronicles,26,21,"King Uzziah was a leper to the day of his death; and he lived in a separate house, being a leper, for he was cut off from the house of the LORD. And Jotham his son was over the king’s house judging the people of the land."
2 Chronicles,26,22,"Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first to last, the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, has written."
2 Chronicles,26,23,"So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the grave which belonged to the kings, for they said, “He is a leper.” And Jotham his son became king in his place."
2 Chronicles,27,1,"Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok."
2 Chronicles,27,2,"He did right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Uzziah had done; however he did not enter the temple of the LORD. But the people continued acting corruptly."
2 Chronicles,27,3,"He built the upper gate of the house of the LORD, and he built extensively the wall of Ophel."
2 Chronicles,27,4,"Moreover, he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and he built fortresses and towers on the wooded hills."
2 Chronicles,27,5,"He fought also with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed over them so that the Ammonites gave him during that year one hundred talents of silver, ten thousand kors of wheat and ten thousand of barley. The Ammonites also paid him this amount in the second and in the third year."
2 Chronicles,27,6,So Jotham became mighty because he ordered his ways before the LORD his God.
2 Chronicles,27,7,"Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, even all his wars and his acts, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah."
2 Chronicles,27,8,"He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,27,9,"And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Ahaz his son became king in his place."
2 Chronicles,28,1,"Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not do right in the sight of the LORD as David his father had done."
2 Chronicles,28,2,But he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel; he also made molten images for the Baals.
2 Chronicles,28,3,"Moreover, he burned incense in the valley of Ben-hinnom and burned his sons in fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD had driven out before the sons of Israel."
2 Chronicles,28,4,"He sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills and under every green tree."
2 Chronicles,28,5,"Wherefore, the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Aram; and they defeated him and carried away from him a great number of captives and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who inflicted him with heavy casualties."
2 Chronicles,28,6,"For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah 120,000 in one day, all valiant men, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers."
2 Chronicles,28,7,"And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king’s son and Azrikam the ruler of the house and Elkanah the second to the king."
2 Chronicles,28,8,"The sons of Israel carried away captive of their brethren 200,000 women, sons and daughters; and they took also a great deal of spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria."
2 Chronicles,28,9,"But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded; and he went out to meet the army which came to Samaria and said to them, “Behold, because the LORD, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, He has delivered them into your hand, and you have slain them in a rage which has even reached heaven."
2 Chronicles,28,10,"Now you are proposing to subjugate for yourselves the people of Judah and Jerusalem for male and female slaves. Surely, do you not have transgressions of your own against the LORD your God?"
2 Chronicles,28,11,"Now therefore, listen to me and return the captives whom you captured from your brothers, for the burning anger of the LORD is against you.”"
2 Chronicles,28,12,"Then some of the heads of the sons of Ephraim—Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai—arose against those who were coming from the battle,"
2 Chronicles,28,13,"and said to them, “You must not bring the captives in here, for you are proposing to bring upon us guilt against the LORD adding to our sins and our guilt; for our guilt is great so that His burning anger is against Israel.”"
2 Chronicles,28,14,So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the officers and all the assembly.
2 Chronicles,28,15,"Then the men who were designated by name arose, took the captives, and they clothed all their naked ones from the spoil; and they gave them clothes and sandals, fed them and gave them drink, anointed them with oil, led all their feeble ones on donkeys, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brothers; then they returned to Samaria."
2 Chronicles,28,16,At that time King Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria for help.
2 Chronicles,28,17,For again the Edomites had come and attacked Judah and carried away captives.
2 Chronicles,28,18,"The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland and of the Negev of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, and Soco with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages, and they settled there."
2 Chronicles,28,19,"For the LORD humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had brought about a lack of restraint in Judah and was very unfaithful to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,28,20,So Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came against him and afflicted him instead of strengthening him.
2 Chronicles,28,21,"Although Ahaz took a portion out of the house of the LORD and out of the palace of the king and of the princes, and gave it to the king of Assyria, it did not help him."
2 Chronicles,28,22,Now in the time of his distress this same King Ahaz became yet more unfaithful to the LORD.
2 Chronicles,28,23,"For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which had defeated him, and said, “Because the gods of the kings of Aram helped them, I will sacrifice to them that they may help me.” But they became the downfall of him and all Israel."
2 Chronicles,28,24,"Moreover, when Ahaz gathered together the utensils of the house of God, he cut the utensils of the house of God in pieces; and he closed the doors of the house of the LORD and made altars for himself in every corner of Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,28,25,"In every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked the LORD, the God of his fathers, to anger."
2 Chronicles,28,26,"Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from first to last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel."
2 Chronicles,28,27,"So Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem, for they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel; and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place."
2 Chronicles,29,1,"Hezekiah became king when he was twenty-five years old; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah."
2 Chronicles,29,2,"He did right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father David had done."
2 Chronicles,29,3,"In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the LORD and repaired them."
2 Chronicles,29,4,He brought in the priests and the Levites and gathered them into the square on the east.
2 Chronicles,29,5,"Then he said to them, “Listen to me, O Levites. Consecrate yourselves now, and consecrate the house of the LORD, the God of your fathers, and carry the uncleanness out from the holy place."
2 Chronicles,29,6,"For our fathers have been unfaithful and have done evil in the sight of the LORD our God, and have forsaken Him and turned their faces away from the dwelling place of the LORD, and have turned their backs."
2 Chronicles,29,7,"They have also shut the doors of the porch and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,29,8,"Therefore the wrath of the LORD was against Judah and Jerusalem, and He has made them an object of terror, of horror, and of hissing, as you see with your own eyes."
2 Chronicles,29,9,"For behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this."
2 Chronicles,29,10,"Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that His burning anger may turn away from us."
2 Chronicles,29,11,"My sons, do not be negligent now, for the LORD has chosen you to stand before Him, to minister to Him, and to be His ministers and burn incense.”"
2 Chronicles,29,12,"Then the Levites arose: Mahath, the son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah, from the sons of the Kohathites; and from the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and from the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah and Eden the son of Joah;"
2 Chronicles,29,13,"and from the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; and from the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;"
2 Chronicles,29,14,"and from the sons of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; and from the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel."
2 Chronicles,29,15,"They assembled their brothers, consecrated themselves, and went in to cleanse the house of the LORD, according to the commandment of the king by the words of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,29,16,"So the priests went in to the inner part of the house of the LORD to cleanse it, and every unclean thing which they found in the temple of the LORD they brought out to the court of the house of the LORD. Then the Levites received it to carry out to the Kidron valley."
2 Chronicles,29,17,"Now they began the consecration on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they entered the porch of the LORD. Then they consecrated the house of the LORD in eight days, and finished on the sixteenth day of the first month."
2 Chronicles,29,18,"Then they went in to King Hezekiah and said, “We have cleansed the whole house of the LORD, the altar of burnt offering with all of its utensils, and the table of showbread with all of its utensils."
2 Chronicles,29,19,"Moreover, all the utensils which King Ahaz had discarded during his reign in his unfaithfulness, we have prepared and consecrated; and behold, they are before the altar of the LORD.”"
2 Chronicles,29,20,Then King Hezekiah arose early and assembled the princes of the city and went up to the house of the LORD.
2 Chronicles,29,21,"They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs and seven male goats for a sin offering for the kingdom, the sanctuary, and Judah. And he ordered the priests, the sons of Aaron, to offer them on the altar of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,29,22,"So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar. They also slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar; they slaughtered the lambs also and sprinkled the blood on the altar."
2 Chronicles,29,23,"Then they brought the male goats of the sin offering before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them."
2 Chronicles,29,24,"The priests slaughtered them and purged the altar with their blood to atone for all Israel, for the king ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel."
2 Chronicles,29,25,"He then stationed the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with harps and with lyres, according to the command of David and of Gad the king’s seer, and of Nathan the prophet; for the command was from the LORD through His prophets."
2 Chronicles,29,26,"The Levites stood with the musical instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets."
2 Chronicles,29,27,"Then Hezekiah gave the order to offer the burnt offering on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song to the LORD also began with the trumpets, accompanied by the instruments of David, king of Israel."
2 Chronicles,29,28,"While the whole assembly worshiped, the singers also sang and the trumpets sounded; all this continued until the burnt offering was finished."
2 Chronicles,29,29,"Now at the completion of the burnt offerings, the king and all who were present with him bowed down and worshiped."
2 Chronicles,29,30,"Moreover, King Hezekiah and the officials ordered the Levites to sing praises to the LORD with the words of David and Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with joy, and bowed down and worshiped."
2 Chronicles,29,31,"Then Hezekiah said, “Now that you have consecrated yourselves to the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of the LORD.” And the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all those who were willing brought burnt offerings."
2 Chronicles,29,32,"The number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was 70 bulls, 100 rams, and 200 lambs; all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,29,33,"The consecrated things were 600 bulls and 3,000 sheep."
2 Chronicles,29,34,"But the priests were too few, so that they were unable to skin all the burnt offerings; therefore their brothers the Levites helped them until the work was completed and until the other priests had consecrated themselves. For the Levites were more conscientious to consecrate themselves than the priests."
2 Chronicles,29,35,There were also many burnt offerings with the fat of the peace offerings and with the libations for the burnt offerings. Thus the service of the house of the LORD was established again.
2 Chronicles,29,36,"Then Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced over what God had prepared for the people, because the thing came about suddenly."
2 Chronicles,30,1,"Now Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover to the LORD God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,30,2,"For the king and his princes and all the assembly in Jerusalem had decided to celebrate the Passover in the second month,"
2 Chronicles,30,3,"since they could not celebrate it at that time, because the priests had not consecrated themselves in sufficient numbers, nor had the people been gathered to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,30,4,Thus the thing was right in the sight of the king and all the assembly.
2 Chronicles,30,5,"So they established a decree to circulate a proclamation throughout all Israel from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to celebrate the Passover to the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem. For they had not celebrated it in great numbers as it was prescribed."
2 Chronicles,30,6,"The couriers went throughout all Israel and Judah with the letters from the hand of the king and his princes, even according to the command of the king, saying, “O sons of Israel, return to the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, that He may return to those of you who escaped and are left from the hand of the kings of Assyria."
2 Chronicles,30,7,"Do not be like your fathers and your brothers, who were unfaithful to the LORD God of their fathers, so that He made them a horror, as you see."
2 Chronicles,30,8,"Now do not stiffen your neck like your fathers, but yield to the LORD and enter His sanctuary which He has consecrated forever, and serve the LORD your God, that His burning anger may turn away from you."
2 Chronicles,30,9,"For if you return to the LORD, your brothers and your sons will find compassion before those who led them captive and will return to this land. For the LORD your God is gracious and compassionate, and will not turn His face away from you if you return to Him.”"
2 Chronicles,30,10,"So the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, and as far as Zebulun, but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them."
2 Chronicles,30,11,"Nevertheless some men of Asher, Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,30,12,The hand of God was also on Judah to give them one heart to do what the king and the princes commanded by the word of the LORD.
2 Chronicles,30,13,"Now many people were gathered at Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month, a very large assembly."
2 Chronicles,30,14,They arose and removed the altars which were in Jerusalem; they also removed all the incense altars and cast them into the brook Kidron.
2 Chronicles,30,15,"Then they slaughtered the Passover lambs on the fourteenth of the second month. And the priests and Levites were ashamed of themselves, and consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the house of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,30,16,"They stood at their stations after their custom, according to the law of Moses the man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood which they received from the hand of the Levites."
2 Chronicles,30,17,"For there were many in the assembly who had not consecrated themselves; therefore, the Levites were over the slaughter of the Passover lambs for everyone who was unclean, in order to consecrate them to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,30,18,"For a multitude of the people, even many from Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not purified themselves, yet they ate the Passover otherwise than prescribed. For Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, “May the good LORD pardon"
2 Chronicles,30,19,"everyone who prepares his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though not according to the purification rules of the sanctuary.”"
2 Chronicles,30,20,So the LORD heard Hezekiah and healed the people.
2 Chronicles,30,21,"The sons of Israel present in Jerusalem celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy, and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day after day with loud instruments to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,30,22,"Then Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who showed good insight in the things of the LORD. So they ate for the appointed seven days, sacrificing peace offerings and giving thanks to the LORD God of their fathers."
2 Chronicles,30,23,"Then the whole assembly decided to celebrate the feast another seven days, so they celebrated the seven days with joy."
2 Chronicles,30,24,"For Hezekiah king of Judah had contributed to the assembly 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep, and the princes had contributed to the assembly 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep; and a large number of priests consecrated themselves."
2 Chronicles,30,25,"All the assembly of Judah rejoiced, with the priests and the Levites and all the assembly that came from Israel, both the sojourners who came from the land of Israel and those living in Judah."
2 Chronicles,30,26,"So there was great joy in Jerusalem, because there was nothing like this in Jerusalem since the days of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel."
2 Chronicles,30,27,"Then the Levitical priests arose and blessed the people; and their voice was heard and their prayer came to His holy dwelling place, to heaven."
2 Chronicles,31,1,"Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah, broke the pillars in pieces, cut down the Asherim and pulled down the high places and the altars throughout all Judah and Benjamin, as well as in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the sons of Israel returned to their cities, each to his possession."
2 Chronicles,31,2,"And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites by their divisions, each according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister and to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the camp of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,31,3,"He also appointed the king’s portion of his goods for the burnt offerings, namely, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths and for the new moons and for the fixed festivals, as it is written in the law of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,31,4,"Also he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion due to the priests and the Levites, that they might devote themselves to the law of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,31,5,"As soon as the order spread, the sons of Israel provided in abundance the first fruits of grain, new wine, oil, honey and of all the produce of the field; and they brought in abundantly the tithe of all."
2 Chronicles,31,6,"The sons of Israel and Judah who lived in the cities of Judah also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of sacred gifts which were consecrated to the LORD their God, and placed them in heaps."
2 Chronicles,31,7,"In the third month they began to make the heaps, and finished them by the seventh month."
2 Chronicles,31,8,"When Hezekiah and the rulers came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD and His people Israel."
2 Chronicles,31,9,Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.
2 Chronicles,31,10,"Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok said to him, “Since the contributions began to be brought into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat with plenty left over, for the LORD has blessed His people, and this great quantity is left over.”"

Ezra,2,59,"Now these are those who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan and Immer, but they were not able to give evidence of their fathers’ households and their descendants, whether they were of Israel:"
Ezra,2,60,"the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, 652."
Ezra,2,61,"Of the sons of the priests: the sons of Habaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai, who took a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and he was called by their name."
Ezra,2,62,"These searched among their ancestral registration, but they could not be located; therefore they were considered unclean and excluded from the priesthood."
Ezra,2,63,The governor said to them that they should not eat from the most holy things until a priest stood up with Urim and Thummim.
Ezra,2,64,"The whole assembly numbered 42,360,"
Ezra,2,65,"besides their male and female servants who numbered 7,337; and they had 200 singing men and women."

Ezra,2,68,"Some of the heads of fathers’ households, when they arrived at the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem, offered willingly for the house of God to restore it on its foundation."
Ezra,2,69,"According to their ability they gave to the treasury for the work 61,000 gold drachmas and 5,000 silver minas and 100 priestly garments."
Ezra,2,70,"Now the priests and the Levites, some of the people, the singers, the gatekeepers and the temple servants lived in their cities, and all Israel in their cities."
Ezra,3,1,"Now when the seventh month came, and the sons of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered together as one man to Jerusalem."
Ezra,3,2,"Then Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brothers arose and built the altar of the God of Israel to offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the law of Moses, the man of God."
Ezra,3,3,"So they set up the altar on its foundation, for they were terrified because of the peoples of the lands; and they offered burnt offerings on it to the LORD, burnt offerings morning and evening."
Ezra,3,4,"They celebrated the Feast of Booths, as it is written, and offered the fixed number of burnt offerings daily, according to the ordinance, as each day required;"
Ezra,3,5,"and afterward there was a continual burnt offering, also for the new moons and for all the fixed festivals of the LORD that were consecrated, and from everyone who offered a freewill offering to the LORD."
Ezra,3,6,"From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD, but the foundation of the temple of the LORD had not been laid."
Ezra,3,7,"Then they gave money to the masons and carpenters, and food, drink and oil to the Sidonians and to the Tyrians, to bring cedar wood from Lebanon to the sea at Joppa, according to the permission they had from Cyrus king of Persia."
Ezra,3,8,"Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak and the rest of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all who came from the captivity to Jerusalem, began the work and appointed the Levites from twenty years and older to oversee the work of the house of the LORD."
Ezra,3,9,"Then Jeshua with his sons and brothers stood united with Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah and the sons of Henadad with their sons and brothers the Levites, to oversee the workmen in the temple of God."
Ezra,3,10,"Now when the builders had laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, the priests stood in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise the LORD according to the directions of King David of Israel."
Ezra,3,11,"They sang, praising and giving thanks to the LORD, saying, “For He is good, for His lovingkindness is upon Israel forever.” And all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the LORD because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid."
Ezra,3,12,"Yet many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers’ households, the old men who had seen the first temple, wept with a loud voice when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, while many shouted aloud for joy,"
Ezra,3,13,"so that the people could not distinguish the sound of the shout of joy from the sound of the weeping of the people, for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the sound was heard far away."
Ezra,4,1,"Now when the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the people of the exile were building a temple to the LORD God of Israel,"
Ezra,4,2,"they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of fathers’ households, and said to them, “Let us build with you, for we, like you, seek your God; and we have been sacrificing to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here.”"
Ezra,4,3,"But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of fathers’ households of Israel said to them, “You have nothing in common with us in building a house to our God; but we ourselves will together build to the LORD God of Israel, as King Cyrus, the king of Persia has commanded us.”"
Ezra,4,4,"Then the people of the land discouraged the people of Judah, and frightened them from building,"
Ezra,4,5,"and hired counselors against them to frustrate their counsel all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia."
Ezra,4,6,"Now in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem."
Ezra,4,7,"And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel and the rest of his colleagues wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the text of the letter was written in Aramaic and translated from Aramaic."
Ezra,4,8,"Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes, as follows—"
Ezra,4,9,"then wrote Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe and the rest of their colleagues, the judges and the lesser governors, the officials, the secretaries, the men of Erech, the Babylonians, the men of Susa, that is, the Elamites,"
Ezra,4,10,"and the rest of the nations which the great and honorable Osnappar deported and settled in the city of Samaria, and in the rest of the region beyond the River. Now"
Ezra,4,11,"this is the copy of the letter which they sent to him: “To King Artaxerxes: Your servants, the men in the region beyond the River, and now"
Ezra,4,12,let it be known to the king that the Jews who came up from you have come to us at Jerusalem; they are rebuilding the rebellious and evil city and are finishing the walls and repairing the foundations.
Ezra,4,13,"Now let it be known to the king, that if that city is rebuilt and the walls are finished, they will not pay tribute, custom or toll, and it will damage the revenue of the kings."
Ezra,4,14,"Now because we are in the service of the palace, and it is not fitting for us to see the king’s dishonor, therefore we have sent and informed the king,"
Ezra,4,15,"so that a search may be made in the record books of your fathers. And you will discover in the record books and learn that that city is a rebellious city and damaging to kings and provinces, and that they have incited revolt within it in past days; therefore that city was laid waste."
Ezra,4,16,"We inform the king that if that city is rebuilt and the walls finished, as a result you will have no possession in the province beyond the River.”"
Ezra,4,17,"Then the king sent an answer to Rehum the commander, to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their colleagues who live in Samaria and in the rest of the provinces beyond the River: “Peace. And now"
Ezra,4,18,the document which you sent to us has been translated and read before me.
Ezra,4,19,"A decree has been issued by me, and a search has been made and it has been discovered that that city has risen up against the kings in past days, that rebellion and revolt have been perpetrated in it,"
Ezra,4,20,"that mighty kings have ruled over Jerusalem, governing all the provinces beyond the River, and that tribute, custom and toll were paid to them."
Ezra,4,21,"So, now issue a decree to make these men stop work, that this city may not be rebuilt until a decree is issued by me."
Ezra,4,22,Beware of being negligent in carrying out this matter; why should damage increase to the detriment of the kings?”
Ezra,4,23,"Then as soon as the copy of King Artaxerxes’ document was read before Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their colleagues, they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews and stopped them by force of arms."
Ezra,4,24,"Then work on the house of God in Jerusalem ceased, and it was stopped until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia."
Ezra,5,1,"When the prophets, Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, who was over them,"
Ezra,5,2,then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak arose and began to rebuild the house of God which is in Jerusalem; and the prophets of God were with them supporting them.
Ezra,5,3,"At that time Tattenai, the governor of the province beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai and their colleagues came to them and spoke to them thus, “Who issued you a decree to rebuild this temple and to finish this structure?”"
Ezra,5,4,Then we told them accordingly what the names of the men were who were reconstructing this building.
Ezra,5,5,"But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, and they did not stop them until a report could come to Darius, and then a written reply be returned concerning it."
Ezra,5,6,"This is the copy of the letter which Tattenai, the governor of the province beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai and his colleagues the officials, who were beyond the River, sent to Darius the king."
Ezra,5,7,"They sent a report to him in which it was written thus: “To Darius the king, all peace."
Ezra,5,8,"Let it be known to the king that we have gone to the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is being built with huge stones, and beams are being laid in the walls; and this work is going on with great care and is succeeding in their hands."
Ezra,5,9,"Then we asked those elders and said to them thus, ‘Who issued you a decree to rebuild this temple and to finish this structure?’"
Ezra,5,10,"We also asked them their names so as to inform you, and that we might write down the names of the men who were at their head."
Ezra,5,11,"Thus they answered us, saying, ‘We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth and are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished."
Ezra,5,12,"But because our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this temple and deported the people to Babylon."
Ezra,5,13,"However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this house of God."
Ezra,5,14,"Also the gold and silver utensils of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, and brought them to the temple of Babylon, these King Cyrus took from the temple of Babylon and they were given to one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had appointed governor."
Ezra,5,15,"He said to him, “Take these utensils, go and deposit them in the temple in Jerusalem and let the house of God be rebuilt in its place.”"
Ezra,5,16,Then that Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem; and from then until now it has been under construction and it is not yet completed.’
Ezra,5,17,"“Now if it pleases the king, let a search be conducted in the king’s treasure house, which is there in Babylon, if it be that a decree was issued by King Cyrus to rebuild this house of God at Jerusalem; and let the king send to us his decision concerning this matter.”"
Ezra,6,1,"Then King Darius issued a decree, and search was made in the archives, where the treasures were stored in Babylon."
Ezra,6,2,"In Ecbatana in the fortress, which is in the province of Media, a scroll was found and there was written in it as follows: “Memorandum—"
Ezra,6,3,"In the first year of King Cyrus, Cyrus the king issued a decree: ‘Concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, let the temple, the place where sacrifices are offered, be rebuilt and let its foundations be retained, its height being 60 cubits and its width 60 cubits;"
Ezra,6,4,with three layers of huge stones and one layer of timbers. And let the cost be paid from the royal treasury.
Ezra,6,5,"Also let the gold and silver utensils of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be returned and brought to their places in the temple in Jerusalem; and you shall put them in the house of God.’"
Ezra,6,6,"“Now therefore, Tattenai, governor of the province beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai and your colleagues, the officials of the provinces beyond the River, keep away from there."
Ezra,6,7,Leave this work on the house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews rebuild this house of God on its site.
Ezra,6,8,"Moreover, I issue a decree concerning what you are to do for these elders of Judah in the rebuilding of this house of God: the full cost is to be paid to these people from the royal treasury out of the taxes of the provinces beyond the River, and that without delay."
Ezra,6,9,"Whatever is needed, both young bulls, rams, and lambs for a burnt offering to the God of heaven, and wheat, salt, wine and anointing oil, as the priests in Jerusalem request, it is to be given to them daily without fail,"
Ezra,6,10,that they may offer acceptable sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons.
Ezra,6,11,"And I issued a decree that any man who violates this edict, a timber shall be drawn from his house and he shall be impaled on it and his house shall be made a refuse heap on account of this."
Ezra,6,12,"May the God who has caused His name to dwell there overthrow any king or people who attempts to change it, so as to destroy this house of God in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have issued this decree, let it be carried out with all diligence!”"
Ezra,6,13,"Then Tattenai, the governor of the province beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai and their colleagues carried out the decree with all diligence, just as King Darius had sent."
Ezra,6,14,"And the elders of the Jews were successful in building through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they finished building according to the command of the God of Israel and the decree of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia."
Ezra,6,15,This temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar; it was the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.
Ezra,6,16,"And the sons of Israel, the priests, the Levites and the rest of the exiles, celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy."
Ezra,6,17,"They offered for the dedication of this temple of God 100 bulls, 200 rams, 400 lambs, and as a sin offering for all Israel 12 male goats, corresponding to the number of the tribes of Israel."
Ezra,6,18,"Then they appointed the priests to their divisions and the Levites in their orders for the service of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses."
Ezra,6,19,The exiles observed the Passover on the fourteenth of the first month.
Ezra,6,20,"For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were pure. Then they slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the exiles, both for their brothers the priests and for themselves."
Ezra,6,21,"The sons of Israel who returned from exile and all those who had separated themselves from the impurity of the nations of the land to join them, to seek the LORD God of Israel, ate the Passover."
Ezra,6,22,"And they observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with joy, for the LORD had caused them to rejoice, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them to encourage them in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel."
Ezra,7,1,"Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, there went up Ezra son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah,"
Ezra,7,2,"son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub,"
Ezra,7,3,"son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth,"
Ezra,7,4,"son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki,"
Ezra,7,5,"son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the chief priest."
Ezra,7,6,"This Ezra went up from Babylon, and he was a scribe skilled in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given; and the king granted him all he requested because the hand of the LORD his God was upon him."
Ezra,7,7,"Some of the sons of Israel and some of the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers and the temple servants went up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes."
Ezra,7,8,"He came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king."
Ezra,7,9,"For on the first of the first month he began to go up from Babylon; and on the first of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, because the good hand of his God was upon him."
Ezra,7,10,"For Ezra had set his heart to study the law of the LORD and to practice it, and to teach His statutes and ordinances in Israel."
Ezra,7,11,"Now this is the copy of the decree which King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, learned in the words of the commandments of the LORD and His statutes to Israel:"
Ezra,7,12,"“Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace. And now"
Ezra,7,13,"I have issued a decree that any of the people of Israel and their priests and the Levites in my kingdom who are willing to go to Jerusalem, may go with you."
Ezra,7,14,"Forasmuch as you are sent by the king and his seven counselors to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem according to the law of your God which is in your hand,"
Ezra,7,15,"and to bring the silver and gold, which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem,"
Ezra,7,16,"with all the silver and gold which you find in the whole province of Babylon, along with the freewill offering of the people and of the priests, who offered willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem;"
Ezra,7,17,"with this money, therefore, you shall diligently buy bulls, rams and lambs, with their grain offerings and their drink offerings and offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem."
Ezra,7,18,"Whatever seems good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and gold, you may do according to the will of your God."
Ezra,7,19,"Also the utensils which are given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver in full before the God of Jerusalem."
Ezra,7,20,"The rest of the needs for the house of your God, for which you may have occasion to provide, provide for it from the royal treasury."
Ezra,7,21,"“I, even I, King Artaxerxes, issue a decree to all the treasurers who are in the provinces beyond the River, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, may require of you, it shall be done diligently,"
Ezra,7,22,"even up to 100 talents of silver, 100 kors of wheat, 100 baths of wine, 100 baths of oil, and salt as needed."
Ezra,7,23,"Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done with zeal for the house of the God of heaven, so that there will not be wrath against the kingdom of the king and his sons."
Ezra,7,24,"We also inform you that it is not allowed to impose tax, tribute or toll on any of the priests, Levites, singers, doorkeepers, Nethinim or servants of this house of God."
Ezra,7,25,"“You, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God which is in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges that they may judge all the people who are in the province beyond the River, even all those who know the laws of your God; and you may teach anyone who is ignorant of them."
Ezra,7,26,"Whoever will not observe the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be executed upon him strictly, whether for death or for banishment or for confiscation of goods or for imprisonment.”"
Ezra,7,27,"Blessed be the LORD, the God of our fathers, who has put such a thing as this in the king’s heart, to adorn the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem,"
Ezra,7,28,"and has extended lovingkindness to me before the king and his counselors and before all the king’s mighty princes. Thus I was strengthened according to the hand of the LORD my God upon me, and I gathered leading men from Israel to go up with me."
Ezra,8,1,Now these are the heads of their fathers’ households and the genealogical enrollment of those who went up with me from Babylon in the reign of King Artaxerxes:
Ezra,8,2,"of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom; of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel; of the sons of David, Hattush;"
Ezra,8,3,"of the sons of Shecaniah who was of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah and with him 150 males who were in the genealogical list;"
Ezra,8,4,"of the sons of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah and 200 males with him;"
Ezra,8,5,"of the sons of Zattu, Shecaniah, the son of Jahaziel and 300 males with him;"
Ezra,8,6,"and of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan and 50 males with him;"
Ezra,8,7,"and of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah and 70 males with him;"
Ezra,8,8,"and of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael and 80 males with him;"
Ezra,8,9,"of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel and 218 males with him;"
Ezra,8,10,"and of the sons of Bani, Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah and 160 males with him;"
Ezra,8,11,"and of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai and 28 males with him;"
Ezra,8,12,"and of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan and 110 males with him;"
Ezra,8,13,"and of the sons of Adonikam, the last ones, these being their names, Eliphelet, Jeuel and Shemaiah, and 60 males with them;"
Ezra,8,14,"and of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud, and 70 males with them."
Ezra,8,15,"Now I assembled them at the river that runs to Ahava, where we camped for three days; and when I observed the people and the priests, I did not find any Levites there."
Ezra,8,16,"So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah and Meshullam, leading men, and for Joiarib and Elnathan, teachers."
Ezra,8,17,"I sent them to Iddo the leading man at the place Casiphia; and I told them what to say to Iddo and his brothers, the temple servants at the place Casiphia, that is, to bring ministers to us for the house of our God."
Ezra,8,18,"According to the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of insight of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel, namely Sherebiah, and his sons and brothers, 18 men;"
Ezra,8,19,"and Hashabiah and Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, with his brothers and their sons, 20 men;"
Ezra,8,20,"and 220 of the temple servants, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites, all of them designated by name."
Ezra,8,21,"Then I proclaimed a fast there at the river of Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God to seek from Him a safe journey for us, our little ones, and all our possessions."
Ezra,8,22,"For I was ashamed to request from the king troops and horsemen to protect us from the enemy on the way, because we had said to the king, “The hand of our God is favorably disposed to all those who seek Him, but His power and His anger are against all those who forsake Him.”"
Ezra,8,23,"So we fasted and sought our God concerning this matter, and He listened to our entreaty."
Ezra,8,24,"Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and with them ten of their brothers;"
Ezra,8,25,"and I weighed out to them the silver, the gold and the utensils, the offering for the house of our God which the king and his counselors and his princes and all Israel present there had offered."
Ezra,8,26,"Thus I weighed into their hands 650 talents of silver, and silver utensils worth 100 talents, and 100 gold talents,"
Ezra,8,27,"and 20 gold bowls worth 1,000 darics, and two utensils of fine shiny bronze, precious as gold."
Ezra,8,28,"Then I said to them, “You are holy to the LORD, and the utensils are holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the LORD God of your fathers."
Ezra,8,29,"Watch and keep them until you weigh them before the leading priests, the Levites and the heads of the fathers’ households of Israel at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD.”"
Ezra,8,30,"So the priests and the Levites accepted the weighed out silver and gold and the utensils, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God."
Ezra,8,31,"Then we journeyed from the river Ahava on the twelfth of the first month to go to Jerusalem; and the hand of our God was over us, and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the ambushes by the way."
Ezra,8,32,Thus we came to Jerusalem and remained there three days.
Ezra,8,33,"On the fourth day the silver and the gold and the utensils were weighed out in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest, and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them were the Levites, Jozabad the son of Jeshua and Noadiah the son of Binnui."
Ezra,8,34,"Everything was numbered and weighed, and all the weight was recorded at that time."
Ezra,8,35,"The exiles who had come from the captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel: 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, 77 lambs, 12 male goats for a sin offering, all as a burnt offering to the LORD."
Ezra,8,36,"Then they delivered the king’s edicts to the king’s satraps and to the governors in the provinces beyond the River, and they supported the people and the house of God."
Ezra,9,1,"Now when these things had been completed, the princes approached me, saying, “The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, according to their abominations, those of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians and the Amorites."
Ezra,9,2,"For they have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy race has intermingled with the peoples of the lands; indeed, the hands of the princes and the rulers have been foremost in this unfaithfulness.”"
Ezra,9,3,"When I heard about this matter, I tore my garment and my robe, and pulled some of the hair from my head and my beard, and sat down appalled."
Ezra,9,4,"Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel on account of the unfaithfulness of the exiles gathered to me, and I sat appalled until the evening offering."
Ezra,9,5,"But at the evening offering I arose from my humiliation, even with my garment and my robe torn, and I fell on my knees and stretched out my hands to the LORD my God;"
Ezra,9,6,"and I said, “O my God, I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift up my face to You, my God, for our iniquities have risen above our heads and our guilt has grown even to the heavens."
Ezra,9,7,"Since the days of our fathers to this day we have been in great guilt, and on account of our iniquities we, our kings and our priests have been given into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity and to plunder and to open shame, as it is this day."
Ezra,9,8,"But now for a brief moment grace has been shown from the LORD our God, to leave us an escaped remnant and to give us a peg in His holy place, that our God may enlighten our eyes and grant us a little reviving in our bondage."
Ezra,9,9,"For we are slaves; yet in our bondage our God has not forsaken us, but has extended lovingkindness to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us reviving to raise up the house of our God, to restore its ruins and to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem."
Ezra,9,10,"“Now, our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken Your commandments,"
Ezra,9,11,"which You have commanded by Your servants the prophets, saying, ‘The land which you are entering to possess is an unclean land with the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations which have filled it from end to end and with their impurity."
Ezra,9,12,"So now do not give your daughters to their sons nor take their daughters to your sons, and never seek their peace or their prosperity, that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land and leave it as an inheritance to your sons forever.’"
Ezra,9,13,"After all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and our great guilt, since You our God have requited us less than our iniquities deserve, and have given us an escaped remnant as this,"
Ezra,9,14,"shall we again break Your commandments and intermarry with the peoples who commit these abominations? Would You not be angry with us to the point of destruction, until there is no remnant nor any who escape?"
Ezra,9,15,"O LORD God of Israel, You are righteous, for we have been left an escaped remnant, as it is this day; behold, we are before You in our guilt, for no one can stand before You because of this.”"
Ezra,10,1,"Now while Ezra was praying and making confession, weeping and prostrating himself before the house of God, a very large assembly, men, women and children, gathered to him from Israel; for the people wept bitterly."
Ezra,10,2,"Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, said to Ezra, “We have been unfaithful to our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land; yet now there is hope for Israel in spite of this."
Ezra,10,3,"So now let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives and their children, according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law."
Ezra,10,4,"Arise! For this matter is your responsibility, but we will be with you; be courageous and act.”"
Ezra,10,5,"Then Ezra rose and made the leading priests, the Levites and all Israel, take oath that they would do according to this proposal; so they took the oath."
Ezra,10,6,"Then Ezra rose from before the house of God and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib. Although he went there, he did not eat bread nor drink water, for he was mourning over the unfaithfulness of the exiles."
Ezra,10,7,"They made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the exiles, that they should assemble at Jerusalem,"
Ezra,10,8,"and that whoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the leaders and the elders, all his possessions should be forfeited and he himself excluded from the assembly of the exiles."
Ezra,10,9,"So all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within the three days. It was the ninth month on the twentieth of the month, and all the people sat in the open square before the house of God, trembling because of this matter and the heavy rain."
Ezra,10,10,"Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have been unfaithful and have married foreign wives adding to the guilt of Israel."
Ezra,10,11,"Now therefore, make confession to the LORD God of your fathers and do His will; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign wives.”"
Ezra,10,12,"Then all the assembly replied with a loud voice, “That’s right! As you have said, so it is our duty to do."
Ezra,10,13,"But there are many people; it is the rainy season and we are not able to stand in the open. Nor can the task be done in one or two days, for we have transgressed greatly in this matter."
Ezra,10,14,"Let our leaders represent the whole assembly and let all those in our cities who have married foreign wives come at appointed times, together with the elders and judges of each city, until the fierce anger of our God on account of this matter is turned away from us.”"
Ezra,10,15,"Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah opposed this, with Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supporting them."
Ezra,10,16,"But the exiles did so. And Ezra the priest selected men who were heads of fathers’ households for each of their father’s households, all of them by name. So they convened on the first day of the tenth month to investigate the matter."
Ezra,10,17,They finished investigating all the men who had married foreign wives by the first day of the first month.
Ezra,10,18,"Among the sons of the priests who had married foreign wives were found of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib and Gedaliah."
Ezra,10,19,"They pledged to put away their wives, and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their offense."
Ezra,10,20,Of the sons of Immer there were Hanani and Zebadiah;
Ezra,10,21,"and of the sons of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel and Uzziah;"
Ezra,10,22,"and of the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad and Elasah."
Ezra,10,23,"Of Levites there were Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (that is, Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah and Eliezer."
Ezra,10,24,"Of the singers there was Eliashib; and of the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem and Uri."
Ezra,10,25,"Of Israel, of the sons of Parosh there were Ramiah, Izziah, Malchijah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malchijah and Benaiah;"
Ezra,10,26,"and of the sons of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth and Elijah;"
Ezra,10,27,"and of the sons of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad and Aziza;"
Ezra,10,28,"and of the sons of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai and Athlai;"
Ezra,10,29,"and of the sons of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch and Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal and Jeremoth;"
Ezra,10,30,"and of the sons of Pahath-moab: Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui and Manasseh;"
Ezra,10,31,"and of the sons of Harim: Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,"
Ezra,10,32,"Benjamin, Malluch and Shemariah;"
Ezra,10,33,"of the sons of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh and Shimei;"
Ezra,10,34,"of the sons of Bani: Maadai, Amram, Uel,"
Ezra,10,35,"Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhi,"
Ezra,10,36,"Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,"
Ezra,10,37,"Mattaniah, Mattenai, Jaasu,"
Ezra,10,38,"Bani, Binnui, Shimei,"
Ezra,10,39,"Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah,"
Ezra,10,40,"Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,"
Ezra,10,41,"Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah,"
Ezra,10,42,"Shallum, Amariah and Joseph."
Ezra,10,43,"Of the sons of Nebo there were Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel and Benaiah."
Ezra,10,44,"All these had married foreign wives, and some of them had wives by whom they had children."
Nehemiah,1,1,"The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it happened in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, while I was in Susa the capitol,"
Nehemiah,1,2,"that Hanani, one of my brothers, and some men from Judah came; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped and had survived the captivity, and about Jerusalem."
Nehemiah,1,3,"They said to me, “The remnant there in the province who survived the captivity are in great distress and reproach, and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its gates are burned with fire.”"
Nehemiah,1,4,"When I heard these words, I sat down and wept and mourned for days; and I was fasting and praying before the God of heaven."
Nehemiah,1,5,"I said, “I beseech You, O LORD God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who preserves the covenant and lovingkindness for those who love Him and keep His commandments,"
Nehemiah,1,6,"let Your ear now be attentive and Your eyes open to hear the prayer of Your servant which I am praying before You now, day and night, on behalf of the sons of Israel Your servants, confessing the sins of the sons of Israel which we have sinned against You; I and my father’s house have sinned."
Nehemiah,1,7,"We have acted very corruptly against You and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances which You commanded Your servant Moses."
Nehemiah,1,8,"Remember the word which You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you are unfaithful I will scatter you among the peoples;"
Nehemiah,1,9,"but if you return to Me and keep My commandments and do them, though those of you who have been scattered were in the most remote part of the heavens, I will gather them from there and will bring them to the place where I have chosen to cause My name to dwell.’"
Nehemiah,1,10,They are Your servants and Your people whom You redeemed by Your great power and by Your strong hand.
Nehemiah,1,11,"O Lord, I beseech You, may Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant and the prayer of Your servants who delight to revere Your name, and make Your servant successful today and grant him compassion before this man.” Now I was the cupbearer to the king."
Nehemiah,2,1,"And it came about in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, that wine was before him, and I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad in his presence."
Nehemiah,2,2,"So the king said to me, “Why is your face sad though you are not sick? This is nothing but sadness of heart.” Then I was very much afraid."
Nehemiah,2,3,"I said to the king, “Let the king live forever. Why should my face not be sad when the city, the place of my fathers’ tombs, lies desolate and its gates have been consumed by fire?”"
Nehemiah,2,4,"Then the king said to me, “What would you request?” So I prayed to the God of heaven."
Nehemiah,2,5,"I said to the king, “If it please the king, and if your servant has found favor before you, send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’ tombs, that I may rebuild it.”"
Nehemiah,2,6,"Then the king said to me, the queen sitting beside him, “How long will your journey be, and when will you return?” So it pleased the king to send me, and I gave him a definite time."
Nehemiah,2,7,"And I said to the king, “If it please the king, let letters be given me for the governors of the provinces beyond the River, that they may allow me to pass through until I come to Judah,"
Nehemiah,2,8,"and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress which is by the temple, for the wall of the city and for the house to which I will go.” And the king granted them to me because the good hand of my God was on me."
Nehemiah,2,9,Then I came to the governors of the provinces beyond the River and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent with me officers of the army and horsemen.
Nehemiah,2,10,"When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about it, it was very displeasing to them that someone had come to seek the welfare of the sons of Israel."
Nehemiah,2,11,So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days.
Nehemiah,2,12,"And I arose in the night, I and a few men with me. I did not tell anyone what my God was putting into my mind to do for Jerusalem and there was no animal with me except the animal on which I was riding."
Nehemiah,2,13,"So I went out at night by the Valley Gate in the direction of the Dragon’s Well and on to the Refuse Gate, inspecting the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and its gates which were consumed by fire."
Nehemiah,2,14,"Then I passed on to the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool, but there was no place for my mount to pass."
Nehemiah,2,15,So I went up at night by the ravine and inspected the wall. Then I entered the Valley Gate again and returned.
Nehemiah,2,16,"The officials did not know where I had gone or what I had done; nor had I as yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials or the rest who did the work."
Nehemiah,2,17,"Then I said to them, “You see the bad situation we are in, that Jerusalem is desolate and its gates burned by fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem so that we will no longer be a reproach.”"
Nehemiah,2,18,"I told them how the hand of my God had been favorable to me and also about the king’s words which he had spoken to me. Then they said, “Let us arise and build.” So they put their hands to the good work."
Nehemiah,2,19,"But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard it, they mocked us and despised us and said, “What is this thing you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?”"
Nehemiah,2,20,"So I answered them and said to them, “The God of heaven will give us success; therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no portion, right or memorial in Jerusalem.”"
Nehemiah,3,1,Then Eliashib the high priest arose with his brothers the priests and built the Sheep Gate; they consecrated it and hung its doors. They consecrated the wall to the Tower of the Hundred and the Tower of Hananel.
Nehemiah,3,2,"Next to him the men of Jericho built, and next to them Zaccur the son of Imri built."
Nehemiah,3,3,Now the sons of Hassenaah built the Fish Gate; they laid its beams and hung its doors with its bolts and bars.
Nehemiah,3,4,Next to them Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz made repairs. And next to him Meshullam the son of Berechiah the son of Meshezabel made repairs. And next to him Zadok the son of Baana also made repairs.
Nehemiah,3,5,"Moreover, next to him the Tekoites made repairs, but their nobles did not support the work of their masters."
Nehemiah,3,6,Joiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah repaired the Old Gate; they laid its beams and hung its doors with its bolts and its bars.
Nehemiah,3,7,"Next to them Melatiah the Gibeonite and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon and of Mizpah, also made repairs for the official seat of the governor of the province beyond the River."
Nehemiah,3,8,"Next to him Uzziel the son of Harhaiah of the goldsmiths made repairs. And next to him Hananiah, one of the perfumers, made repairs, and they restored Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall."
Nehemiah,3,9,"Next to them Rephaiah the son of Hur, the official of half the district of Jerusalem, made repairs."
Nehemiah,3,10,Next to them Jedaiah the son of Harumaph made repairs opposite his house. And next to him Hattush the son of Hashabneiah made repairs.
Nehemiah,3,11,Malchijah the son of Harim and Hasshub the son of Pahath-moab repaired another section and the Tower of Furnaces.
Nehemiah,3,12,"Next to him Shallum the son of Hallohesh, the official of half the district of Jerusalem, made repairs, he and his daughters."
Nehemiah,3,13,"Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the Valley Gate. They built it and hung its doors with its bolts and its bars, and a thousand cubits of the wall to the Refuse Gate."
Nehemiah,3,14,"Malchijah the son of Rechab, the official of the district of Beth-haccherem repaired the Refuse Gate. He built it and hung its doors with its bolts and its bars."
Nehemiah,3,15,"Shallum the son of Col-hozeh, the official of the district of Mizpah, repaired the Fountain Gate. He built it, covered it and hung its doors with its bolts and its bars, and the wall of the Pool of Shelah at the king’s garden as far as the steps that descend from the city of David."
Nehemiah,3,16,"After him Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, official of half the district of Beth-zur, made repairs as far as a point opposite the tombs of David, and as far as the artificial pool and the house of the mighty men."
Nehemiah,3,17,"After him the Levites carried out repairs under Rehum the son of Bani. Next to him Hashabiah, the official of half the district of Keilah, carried out repairs for his district."
Nehemiah,3,18,"After him their brothers carried out repairs under Bavvai the son of Henadad, official of the other half of the district of Keilah."
Nehemiah,3,19,"Next to him Ezer the son of Jeshua, the official of Mizpah, repaired another section in front of the ascent of the armory at the Angle."
Nehemiah,3,20,"After him Baruch the son of Zabbai zealously repaired another section, from the Angle to the doorway of the house of Eliashib the high priest."
Nehemiah,3,21,"After him Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz repaired another section, from the doorway of Eliashib’s house even as far as the end of his house."
Nehemiah,3,22,"After him the priests, the men of the valley, carried out repairs."
Nehemiah,3,23,"After them Benjamin and Hasshub carried out repairs in front of their house. After them Azariah the son of Maaseiah, son of Ananiah, carried out repairs beside his house."
Nehemiah,3,24,"After him Binnui the son of Henadad repaired another section, from the house of Azariah as far as the Angle and as far as the corner."
Nehemiah,3,25,"Palal the son of Uzai made repairs in front of the Angle and the tower projecting from the upper house of the king, which is by the court of the guard. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh made repairs."
Nehemiah,3,26,The temple servants living in Ophel made repairs as far as the front of the Water Gate toward the east and the projecting tower.
Nehemiah,3,27,After them the Tekoites repaired another section in front of the great projecting tower and as far as the wall of Ophel.
Nehemiah,3,28,"Above the Horse Gate the priests carried out repairs, each in front of his house."
Nehemiah,3,29,"After them Zadok the son of Immer carried out repairs in front of his house. And after him Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the East Gate, carried out repairs."
Nehemiah,3,30,"After him Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, repaired another section. After him Meshullam the son of Berechiah carried out repairs in front of his own quarters."
Nehemiah,3,31,"After him Malchijah, one of the goldsmiths, carried out repairs as far as the house of the temple servants and of the merchants, in front of the Inspection Gate and as far as the upper room of the corner."
Nehemiah,3,32,Between the upper room of the corner and the Sheep Gate the goldsmiths and the merchants carried out repairs.
Nehemiah,4,1,"Now it came about that when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became furious and very angry and mocked the Jews."
Nehemiah,4,2,"He spoke in the presence of his brothers and the wealthy men of Samaria and said, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Are they going to restore it for themselves? Can they offer sacrifices? Can they finish in a day? Can they revive the stones from the dusty rubble even the burned ones?”"
Nehemiah,4,3,"Now Tobiah the Ammonite was near him and he said, “Even what they are building—if a fox should jump on it, he would break their stone wall down!”"
Nehemiah,4,4,"Hear, O our God, how we are despised! Return their reproach on their own heads and give them up for plunder in a land of captivity."
Nehemiah,4,5,"Do not forgive their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out before You, for they have demoralized the builders."
Nehemiah,4,6,"So we built the wall and the whole wall was joined together to half its height, for the people had a mind to work."
Nehemiah,4,7,"Now when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the repair of the walls of Jerusalem went on, and that the breaches began to be closed, they were very angry."
Nehemiah,4,8,All of them conspired together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to cause a disturbance in it.
Nehemiah,4,9,"But we prayed to our God, and because of them we set up a guard against them day and night."
Nehemiah,4,10,"Thus in Judah it was said, “The strength of the burden bearers is failing, Yet there is much rubbish; And we ourselves are unable To rebuild the wall.”"
Nehemiah,4,11,"Our enemies said, “They will not know or see until we come among them, kill them and put a stop to the work.”"
Nehemiah,4,12,"When the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times, “They will come up against us from every place where you may turn,”"
Nehemiah,4,13,"then I stationed men in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, the exposed places, and I stationed the people in families with their swords, spears and bows."
Nehemiah,4,14,"When I saw their fear, I rose and spoke to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people: “Do not be afraid of them; remember the Lord who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives and your houses.”"
Nehemiah,4,15,"When our enemies heard that it was known to us, and that God had frustrated their plan, then all of us returned to the wall, each one to his work."
Nehemiah,4,16,"From that day on, half of my servants carried on the work while half of them held the spears, the shields, the bows and the breastplates; and the captains were behind the whole house of Judah."
Nehemiah,4,17,Those who were rebuilding the wall and those who carried burdens took their load with one hand doing the work and the other holding a weapon.
Nehemiah,4,18,"As for the builders, each wore his sword girded at his side as he built, while the trumpeter stood near me."
Nehemiah,4,19,"I said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, “The work is great and extensive, and we are separated on the wall far from one another."
Nehemiah,4,20,"At whatever place you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us.”"
Nehemiah,4,21,So we carried on the work with half of them holding spears from dawn until the stars appeared.
Nehemiah,4,22,"At that time I also said to the people, “Let each man with his servant spend the night within Jerusalem so that they may be a guard for us by night and a laborer by day.”"
Nehemiah,4,23,"So neither I, my brothers, my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us removed our clothes, each took his weapon even to the water."
Nehemiah,5,1,Now there was a great outcry of the people and of their wives against their Jewish brothers.
Nehemiah,5,2,"For there were those who said, “We, our sons and our daughters are many; therefore let us get grain that we may eat and live.”"
Nehemiah,5,3,"There were others who said, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards and our houses that we might get grain because of the famine.”"
Nehemiah,5,4,"Also there were those who said, “We have borrowed money for the king’s tax on our fields and our vineyards."
Nehemiah,5,5,"Now our flesh is like the flesh of our brothers, our children like their children. Yet behold, we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and some of our daughters are forced into bondage already, and we are helpless because our fields and vineyards belong to others.”"
Nehemiah,5,6,Then I was very angry when I had heard their outcry and these words.
Nehemiah,5,7,"I consulted with myself and contended with the nobles and the rulers and said to them, “You are exacting usury, each from his brother!” Therefore, I held a great assembly against them."
Nehemiah,5,8,"I said to them, “We according to our ability have redeemed our Jewish brothers who were sold to the nations; now would you even sell your brothers that they may be sold to us?” Then they were silent and could not find a word to say."
Nehemiah,5,9,"Again I said, “The thing which you are doing is not good; should you not walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies?"
Nehemiah,5,10,"And likewise I, my brothers and my servants are lending them money and grain. Please, let us leave off this usury."
Nehemiah,5,11,"Please, give back to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money and of the grain, the new wine and the oil that you are exacting from them.”"
Nehemiah,5,12,"Then they said, “We will give it back and will require nothing from them; we will do exactly as you say.” So I called the priests and took an oath from them that they would do according to this promise."
Nehemiah,5,13,"I also shook out the front of my garment and said, “Thus may God shake out every man from his house and from his possessions who does not fulfill this promise; even thus may he be shaken out and emptied.” And all the assembly said, “Amen!” And they praised the LORD. Then the people did according to this promise."
Nehemiah,5,14,"Moreover, from the day that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, for twelve years, neither I nor my kinsmen have eaten the governor’s food allowance."
Nehemiah,5,15,But the former governors who were before me laid burdens on the people and took from them bread and wine besides forty shekels of silver; even their servants domineered the people. But I did not do so because of the fear of God.
Nehemiah,5,16,"I also applied myself to the work on this wall; we did not buy any land, and all my servants were gathered there for the work."
Nehemiah,5,17,"Moreover, there were at my table one hundred and fifty Jews and officials, besides those who came to us from the nations that were around us."
Nehemiah,5,18,"Now that which was prepared for each day was one ox and six choice sheep, also birds were prepared for me; and once in ten days all sorts of wine were furnished in abundance. Yet for all this I did not demand the governor’s food allowance, because the servitude was heavy on this people."
Nehemiah,5,19,"Remember me, O my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people."
Nehemiah,6,1,"Now when it was reported to Sanballat, Tobiah, to Geshem the Arab and to the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall, and that no breach remained in it, although at that time I had not set up the doors in the gates,"
Nehemiah,6,2,"then Sanballat and Geshem sent a message to me, saying, “Come, let us meet together at Chephirim in the plain of Ono.” But they were planning to harm me."
Nehemiah,6,3,"So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work and I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?”"
Nehemiah,6,4,"They sent messages to me four times in this manner, and I answered them in the same way."
Nehemiah,6,5,Then Sanballat sent his servant to me in the same manner a fifth time with an open letter in his hand.
Nehemiah,6,6,"In it was written, “It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says, that you and the Jews are planning to rebel; therefore you are rebuilding the wall. And you are to be their king, according to these reports."
Nehemiah,6,7,"You have also appointed prophets to proclaim in Jerusalem concerning you, ‘A king is in Judah!’ And now it will be reported to the king according to these reports. So come now, let us take counsel together.”"
Nehemiah,6,8,"Then I sent a message to him saying, “Such things as you are saying have not been done, but you are inventing them in your own mind.”"
Nehemiah,6,9,"For all of them were trying to frighten us, thinking, “They will become discouraged with the work and it will not be done.” But now, O God, strengthen my hands."
Nehemiah,6,10,"When I entered the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was confined at home, he said, “Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you, and they are coming to kill you at night.”"
Nehemiah,6,11,"But I said, “Should a man like me flee? And could one such as I go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.”"
Nehemiah,6,12,"Then I perceived that surely God had not sent him, but he uttered his prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him."
Nehemiah,6,13,"He was hired for this reason, that I might become frightened and act accordingly and sin, so that they might have an evil report in order that they could reproach me."
Nehemiah,6,14,"Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these works of theirs, and also Noadiah the prophetess and the rest of the prophets who were trying to frighten me."
Nehemiah,6,15,"So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of the month Elul, in fifty-two days."
Nehemiah,6,16,"When all our enemies heard of it, and all the nations surrounding us saw it, they lost their confidence; for they recognized that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God."
Nehemiah,6,17,"Also in those days many letters went from the nobles of Judah to Tobiah, and Tobiah’s letters came to them."
Nehemiah,6,18,"For many in Judah were bound by oath to him because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah."
Nehemiah,6,19,"Moreover, they were speaking about his good deeds in my presence and reported my words to him. Then Tobiah sent letters to frighten me."
Nehemiah,7,1,"Now when the wall was rebuilt and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers and the singers and the Levites were appointed,"
Nehemiah,7,2,"then I put Hanani my brother, and Hananiah the commander of the fortress, in charge of Jerusalem, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many."
Nehemiah,7,3,"Then I said to them, “Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot, and while they are standing guard, let them shut and bolt the doors. Also appoint guards from the inhabitants of Jerusalem, each at his post, and each in front of his own house.”"
Nehemiah,7,4,"Now the city was large and spacious, but the people in it were few and the houses were not built."
Nehemiah,7,5,"Then my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials and the people to be enrolled by genealogies. Then I found the book of the genealogy of those who came up first in which I found the following record:"
Nehemiah,7,6,"These are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his city,"

Nehemiah,7,63,"Of the priests: the sons of Hobaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai, the Gileadite, and was named after them."
Nehemiah,7,64,"These searched among their ancestral registration, but it could not be located; therefore they were considered unclean and excluded from the priesthood."
Nehemiah,7,65,The governor said to them that they should not eat from the most holy things until a priest arose with Urim and Thummim.

Nehemiah,7,73,"Now the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the temple servants and all Israel, lived in their cities. And when the seventh month came, the sons of Israel were in their cities."
Nehemiah,8,1,"And all the people gathered as one man at the square which was in front of the Water Gate, and they asked Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses which the LORD had given to Israel."
Nehemiah,8,2,"Then Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly of men, women and all who could listen with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month."
Nehemiah,8,3,"He read from it before the square which was in front of the Water Gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of men and women, those who could understand; and all the people were attentive to the book of the law."
Nehemiah,8,4,"Ezra the scribe stood at a wooden podium which they had made for the purpose. And beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah on his right hand; and Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah and Meshullam on his left hand."
Nehemiah,8,5,"Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he was standing above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up."
Nehemiah,8,6,"Then Ezra blessed the LORD the great God. And all the people answered, “Amen, Amen!” while lifting up their hands; then they bowed low and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground."
Nehemiah,8,7,"Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, the Levites, explained the law to the people while the people remained in their place."
Nehemiah,8,8,"They read from the book, from the law of God, translating to give the sense so that they understood the reading."
Nehemiah,8,9,"Then Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, “This day is holy to the LORD your God; do not mourn or weep.” For all the people were weeping when they heard the words of the law."
Nehemiah,8,10,"Then he said to them, “Go, eat of the fat, drink of the sweet, and send portions to him who has nothing prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord. Do not be grieved, for the joy of the LORD is your strength.”"
Nehemiah,8,11,"So the Levites calmed all the people, saying, “Be still, for the day is holy; do not be grieved.”"
Nehemiah,8,12,"All the people went away to eat, to drink, to send portions and to celebrate a great festival, because they understood the words which had been made known to them."
Nehemiah,8,13,"Then on the second day the heads of fathers’ households of all the people, the priests and the Levites were gathered to Ezra the scribe that they might gain insight into the words of the law."
Nehemiah,8,14,They found written in the law how the LORD had commanded through Moses that the sons of Israel should live in booths during the feast of the seventh month.
Nehemiah,8,15,"So they proclaimed and circulated a proclamation in all their cities and in Jerusalem, saying, “Go out to the hills, and bring olive branches and wild olive branches, myrtle branches, palm branches and branches of other leafy trees, to make booths, as it is written.”"
Nehemiah,8,16,"So the people went out and brought them and made booths for themselves, each on his roof, and in their courts and in the courts of the house of God, and in the square at the Water Gate and in the square at the Gate of Ephraim."
Nehemiah,8,17,The entire assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made booths and lived in them. The sons of Israel had indeed not done so from the days of Joshua the son of Nun to that day. And there was great rejoicing.
Nehemiah,8,18,"He read from the book of the law of God daily, from the first day to the last day. And they celebrated the feast seven days, and on the eighth day there was a solemn assembly according to the ordinance."
Nehemiah,9,1,"Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the sons of Israel assembled with fasting, in sackcloth and with dirt upon them."
Nehemiah,9,2,"The descendants of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers."
Nehemiah,9,3,"While they stood in their place, they read from the book of the law of the LORD their God for a fourth of the day; and for another fourth they confessed and worshiped the LORD their God."
Nehemiah,9,4,"Now on the Levites’ platform stood Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani and Chenani, and they cried with a loud voice to the LORD their God."
Nehemiah,9,5,"Then the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah and Pethahiah, said, “Arise, bless the LORD your God forever and ever! O may Your glorious name be blessed And exalted above all blessing and praise!"
Nehemiah,9,6,"“You alone are the LORD. You have made the heavens, The heaven of heavens with all their host, The earth and all that is on it, The seas and all that is in them. You give life to all of them And the heavenly host bows down before You."
Nehemiah,9,7,"“You are the LORD God, Who chose Abram And brought him out from Ur of the Chaldees, And gave him the name Abraham."
Nehemiah,9,8,"“You found his heart faithful before You, And made a covenant with him To give him the land of the Canaanite, Of the Hittite and the Amorite, Of the Perizzite, the Jebusite and the Girgashite— To give it to his descendants. And You have fulfilled Your promise, For You are righteous."
Nehemiah,9,9,"“You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, And heard their cry by the Red Sea."
Nehemiah,9,10,"“Then You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, Against all his servants and all the people of his land; For You knew that they acted arrogantly toward them, And made a name for Yourself as it is this day."
Nehemiah,9,11,"“You divided the sea before them, So they passed through the midst of the sea on dry ground; And their pursuers You hurled into the depths, Like a stone into raging waters."
Nehemiah,9,12,"“And with a pillar of cloud You led them by day, And with a pillar of fire by night To light for them the way In which they were to go."
Nehemiah,9,13,"“Then You came down on Mount Sinai, And spoke with them from heaven; You gave them just ordinances and true laws, Good statutes and commandments."
Nehemiah,9,14,"“So You made known to them Your holy sabbath, And laid down for them commandments, statutes and law, Through Your servant Moses."
Nehemiah,9,15,"“You provided bread from heaven for them for their hunger, You brought forth water from a rock for them for their thirst, And You told them to enter in order to possess The land which You swore to give them."
Nehemiah,9,16,"“But they, our fathers, acted arrogantly; They became stubborn and would not listen to Your commandments."
Nehemiah,9,17,"“They refused to listen, And did not remember Your wondrous deeds which You had performed among them; So they became stubborn and appointed a leader to return to their slavery in Egypt. But You are a God of forgiveness, Gracious and compassionate, Slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness; And You did not forsake them."
Nehemiah,9,18,"“Even when they made for themselves A calf of molten metal And said, ‘This is your God Who brought you up from Egypt,’ And committed great blasphemies,"
Nehemiah,9,19,"You, in Your great compassion, Did not forsake them in the wilderness; The pillar of cloud did not leave them by day, To guide them on their way, Nor the pillar of fire by night, to light for them the way in which they were to go."
Nehemiah,9,20,"“You gave Your good Spirit to instruct them, Your manna You did not withhold from their mouth, And You gave them water for their thirst."
Nehemiah,9,21,"“Indeed, forty years You provided for them in the wilderness and they were not in want; Their clothes did not wear out, nor did their feet swell."
Nehemiah,9,22,"“You also gave them kingdoms and peoples, And allotted them to them as a boundary. They took possession of the land of Sihon the king of Heshbon And the land of Og the king of Bashan."
Nehemiah,9,23,"“You made their sons numerous as the stars of heaven, And You brought them into the land Which You had told their fathers to enter and possess."
Nehemiah,9,24,"“So their sons entered and possessed the land. And You subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, And You gave them into their hand, with their kings and the peoples of the land, To do with them as they desired."
Nehemiah,9,25,"“They captured fortified cities and a fertile land. They took possession of houses full of every good thing, Hewn cisterns, vineyards, olive groves, Fruit trees in abundance. So they ate, were filled and grew fat, And reveled in Your great goodness."
Nehemiah,9,26,"“But they became disobedient and rebelled against You, And cast Your law behind their backs And killed Your prophets who had admonished them So that they might return to You, And they committed great blasphemies."
Nehemiah,9,27,"“Therefore You delivered them into the hand of their oppressors who oppressed them, But when they cried to You in the time of their distress, You heard from heaven, and according to Your great compassion You gave them deliverers who delivered them from the hand of their oppressors."
Nehemiah,9,28,"“But as soon as they had rest, they did evil again before You; Therefore You abandoned them to the hand of their enemies, so that they ruled over them. When they cried again to You, You heard from heaven, And many times You rescued them according to Your compassion,"
Nehemiah,9,29,"And admonished them in order to turn them back to Your law. Yet they acted arrogantly and did not listen to Your commandments but sinned against Your ordinances, By which if a man observes them he shall live. And they turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened their neck, and would not listen."
Nehemiah,9,30,"“However, You bore with them for many years, And admonished them by Your Spirit through Your prophets, Yet they would not give ear. Therefore You gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands."
Nehemiah,9,31,"“Nevertheless, in Your great compassion You did not make an end of them or forsake them, For You are a gracious and compassionate God."
Nehemiah,9,32,"“Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and lovingkindness, Do not let all the hardship seem insignificant before You, Which has come upon us, our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our fathers and on all Your people, From the days of the kings of Assyria to this day."
Nehemiah,9,33,"“However, You are just in all that has come upon us; For You have dealt faithfully, but we have acted wickedly."
Nehemiah,9,34,"“For our kings, our leaders, our priests and our fathers have not kept Your law Or paid attention to Your commandments and Your admonitions with which You have admonished them."
Nehemiah,9,35,"“But they, in their own kingdom, With Your great goodness which You gave them, With the broad and rich land which You set before them, Did not serve You or turn from their evil deeds."
Nehemiah,9,36,"“Behold, we are slaves today, And as to the land which You gave to our fathers to eat of its fruit and its bounty, Behold, we are slaves in it."
Nehemiah,9,37,"“Its abundant produce is for the kings Whom You have set over us because of our sins; They also rule over our bodies And over our cattle as they please, So we are in great distress."
Nehemiah,9,38,"“Now because of all this We are making an agreement in writing; And on the sealed document are the names of our leaders, our Levites and our priests.”"

Nehemiah,10,29,"are joining with their kinsmen, their nobles, and are taking on themselves a curse and an oath to walk in God’s law, which was given through Moses, God’s servant, and to keep and to observe all the commandments of GOD our Lord, and His ordinances and His statutes;"
Nehemiah,10,30,and that we will not give our daughters to the peoples of the land or take their daughters for our sons.
Nehemiah,10,31,"As for the peoples of the land who bring wares or any grain on the sabbath day to sell, we will not buy from them on the sabbath or a holy day; and we will forego the crops the seventh year and the exaction of every debt."
Nehemiah,10,32,We also placed ourselves under obligation to contribute yearly one third of a shekel for the service of the house of our God:
Nehemiah,10,33,"for the showbread, for the continual grain offering, for the continual burnt offering, the sabbaths, the new moon, for the appointed times, for the holy things and for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and all the work of the house of our God."
Nehemiah,10,34,"Likewise we cast lots for the supply of wood among the priests, the Levites and the people so that they might bring it to the house of our God, according to our fathers’ households, at fixed times annually, to burn on the altar of the LORD our God, as it is written in the law;"

Nehemiah,10,37,"We will also bring the first of our dough, our contributions, the fruit of every tree, the new wine and the oil to the priests at the chambers of the house of our God, and the tithe of our ground to the Levites, for the Levites are they who receive the tithes in all the rural towns."

Nehemiah,11,20,"The rest of Israel, of the priests and of the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, each on his own inheritance."
Nehemiah,11,21,"But the temple servants were living in Ophel, and Ziha and Gishpa were in charge of the temple servants."
Nehemiah,11,22,"Now the overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica, from the sons of Asaph, who were the singers for the service of the house of God."
Nehemiah,11,23,For there was a commandment from the king concerning them and a firm regulation for the song leaders day by day.
Nehemiah,11,24,"Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the sons of Zerah the son of Judah, was the king’s representative in all matters concerning the people."
Nehemiah,11,25,"Now as for the villages with their fields, some of the sons of Judah lived in Kiriath-arba and its towns, in Dibon and its towns, and in Jekabzeel and its villages,"
Nehemiah,11,26,"and in Jeshua, in Moladah and Beth-pelet,"
Nehemiah,11,27,"and in Hazar-shual, in Beersheba and its towns,"
Nehemiah,11,28,"and in Ziklag, in Meconah and in its towns,"
Nehemiah,11,29,"and in En-rimmon, in Zorah and in Jarmuth,"
Nehemiah,11,30,"Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages, Lachish and its fields, Azekah and its towns. So they encamped from Beersheba as far as the valley of Hinnom."

Nehemiah,11,33,"Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,"
Nehemiah,11,34,"Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,"
Nehemiah,11,35,"Lod and Ono, the valley of craftsmen."
Nehemiah,11,36,"From the Levites, some divisions in Judah belonged to Benjamin."
Nehemiah,12,1,"Now these are the priests and the Levites who came up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,"
Nehemiah,12,2,"Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,"
Nehemiah,12,3,"Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,"

Nehemiah,12,6,"Shemaiah and Joiarib, Jedaiah,"
Nehemiah,12,7,"Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah and Jedaiah. These were the heads of the priests and their kinsmen in the days of Jeshua."
Nehemiah,12,8,"The Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah who was in charge of the songs of thanksgiving, he and his brothers."
Nehemiah,12,9,"Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brothers, stood opposite them in their service divisions."
Nehemiah,12,10,"Jeshua became the father of Joiakim, and Joiakim became the father of Eliashib, and Eliashib became the father of Joiada,"
Nehemiah,12,11,"and Joiada became the father of Jonathan, and Jonathan became the father of Jaddua."
Nehemiah,12,12,"Now in the days of Joiakim, the priests, the heads of fathers’ households were: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;"
Nehemiah,12,13,"of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;"

Nehemiah,12,22,"As for the Levites, the heads of fathers’ households were registered in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan and Jaddua; so were the priests in the reign of Darius the Persian."
Nehemiah,12,23,"The sons of Levi, the heads of fathers’ households, were registered in the Book of the Chronicles up to the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib."
Nehemiah,12,24,"The heads of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers opposite them, to praise and give thanks, as prescribed by David the man of God, division corresponding to division."
Nehemiah,12,25,"Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon and Akkub were gatekeepers keeping watch at the storehouses of the gates."
Nehemiah,12,26,"These served in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priest and scribe."
Nehemiah,12,27,"Now at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought out the Levites from all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem so that they might celebrate the dedication with gladness, with hymns of thanksgiving and with songs to the accompaniment of cymbals, harps and lyres."
Nehemiah,12,28,"So the sons of the singers were assembled from the district around Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites,"
Nehemiah,12,29,"from Beth-gilgal and from their fields in Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built themselves villages around Jerusalem."
Nehemiah,12,30,"The priests and the Levites purified themselves; they also purified the people, the gates and the wall."
Nehemiah,12,31,"Then I had the leaders of Judah come up on top of the wall, and I appointed two great choirs, the first proceeding to the right on top of the wall toward the Refuse Gate."
Nehemiah,12,32,"Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah followed them,"
Nehemiah,12,33,"with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,"
Nehemiah,12,34,"Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah,"
Nehemiah,12,35,"and some of the sons of the priests with trumpets; and Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph,"
Nehemiah,12,36,"and his kinsmen, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God. And Ezra the scribe went before them."
Nehemiah,12,37,At the Fountain Gate they went directly up the steps of the city of David by the stairway of the wall above the house of David to the Water Gate on the east.
Nehemiah,12,38,"The second choir proceeded to the left, while I followed them with half of the people on the wall, above the Tower of Furnaces, to the Broad Wall,"
Nehemiah,12,39,"and above the Gate of Ephraim, by the Old Gate, by the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate; and they stopped at the Gate of the Guard."
Nehemiah,12,40,Then the two choirs took their stand in the house of God. So did I and half of the officials with me;
Nehemiah,12,41,"and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah and Hananiah, with the trumpets;"
Nehemiah,12,42,"and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam and Ezer. And the singers sang, with Jezrahiah their leader,"
Nehemiah,12,43,"and on that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced because God had given them great joy, even the women and children rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard from afar."
Nehemiah,12,44,"On that day men were also appointed over the chambers for the stores, the contributions, the first fruits and the tithes, to gather into them from the fields of the cities the portions required by the law for the priests and Levites; for Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who served."
Nehemiah,12,45,"For they performed the worship of their God and the service of purification, together with the singers and the gatekeepers in accordance with the command of David and of his son Solomon."
Nehemiah,12,46,"For in the days of David and Asaph, in ancient times, there were leaders of the singers, songs of praise and hymns of thanksgiving to God."
Nehemiah,12,47,"So all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah gave the portions due the singers and the gatekeepers as each day required, and set apart the consecrated portion for the Levites, and the Levites set apart the consecrated portion for the sons of Aaron."
Nehemiah,13,1,"On that day they read aloud from the book of Moses in the hearing of the people; and there was found written in it that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter the assembly of God,"
Nehemiah,13,2,"because they did not meet the sons of Israel with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them. However, our God turned the curse into a blessing."
Nehemiah,13,3,"So when they heard the law, they excluded all foreigners from Israel."
Nehemiah,13,4,"Now prior to this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, being related to Tobiah,"
Nehemiah,13,5,"had prepared a large room for him, where formerly they put the grain offerings, the frankincense, the utensils and the tithes of grain, wine and oil prescribed for the Levites, the singers and the gatekeepers, and the contributions for the priests."
Nehemiah,13,6,"But during all this time I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had gone to the king. After some time, however, I asked leave from the king,"
Nehemiah,13,7,"and I came to Jerusalem and learned about the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, by preparing a room for him in the courts of the house of God."
Nehemiah,13,8,"It was very displeasing to me, so I threw all of Tobiah’s household goods out of the room."
Nehemiah,13,9,Then I gave an order and they cleansed the rooms; and I returned there the utensils of the house of God with the grain offerings and the frankincense.
Nehemiah,13,10,"I also discovered that the portions of the Levites had not been given them, so that the Levites and the singers who performed the service had gone away, each to his own field."
Nehemiah,13,11,"So I reprimanded the officials and said, “Why is the house of God forsaken?” Then I gathered them together and restored them to their posts."
Nehemiah,13,12,"All Judah then brought the tithe of the grain, wine and oil into the storehouses."
Nehemiah,13,13,"In charge of the storehouses I appointed Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites, and in addition to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were considered reliable, and it was their task to distribute to their kinsmen."
Nehemiah,13,14,"Remember me for this, O my God, and do not blot out my loyal deeds which I have performed for the house of my God and its services."
Nehemiah,13,15,"In those days I saw in Judah some who were treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sacks of grain and loading them on donkeys, as well as wine, grapes, figs and all kinds of loads, and they brought them into Jerusalem on the sabbath day. So I admonished them on the day they sold food."
Nehemiah,13,16,"Also men of Tyre were living there who imported fish and all kinds of merchandise, and sold them to the sons of Judah on the sabbath, even in Jerusalem."
Nehemiah,13,17,"Then I reprimanded the nobles of Judah and said to them, “What is this evil thing you are doing, by profaning the sabbath day?"
Nehemiah,13,18,"Did not your fathers do the same, so that our God brought on us and on this city all this trouble? Yet you are adding to the wrath on Israel by profaning the sabbath.”"
Nehemiah,13,19,"It came about that just as it grew dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut and that they should not open them until after the sabbath. Then I stationed some of my servants at the gates so that no load would enter on the sabbath day."
Nehemiah,13,20,Once or twice the traders and merchants of every kind of merchandise spent the night outside Jerusalem.
Nehemiah,13,21,"Then I warned them and said to them, “Why do you spend the night in front of the wall? If you do so again, I will use force against you.” From that time on they did not come on the sabbath."
Nehemiah,13,22,"And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves and come as gatekeepers to sanctify the sabbath day. For this also remember me, O my God, and have compassion on me according to the greatness of Your lovingkindness."
Nehemiah,13,23,"In those days I also saw that the Jews had married women from Ashdod, Ammon and Moab."
Nehemiah,13,24,"As for their children, half spoke in the language of Ashdod, and none of them was able to speak the language of Judah, but the language of his own people."
Nehemiah,13,25,"So I contended with them and cursed them and struck some of them and pulled out their hair, and made them swear by God, “You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take of their daughters for your sons or for yourselves."
Nehemiah,13,26,"Did not Solomon king of Israel sin regarding these things? Yet among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel; nevertheless the foreign women caused even him to sin."
Nehemiah,13,27,Do we then hear about you that you have committed all this great evil by acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign women?”
Nehemiah,13,28,"Even one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite, so I drove him away from me."
Nehemiah,13,29,"Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites."
Nehemiah,13,30,"Thus I purified them from everything foreign and appointed duties for the priests and the Levites, each in his task,"
Nehemiah,13,31,"and I arranged for the supply of wood at appointed times and for the first fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good."
Esther,1,1,"Now it took place in the days of Ahasuerus, the Ahasuerus who reigned from India to Ethiopia over 127 provinces,"
Esther,1,2,"in those days as King Ahasuerus sat on his royal throne which was at the citadel in Susa,"
Esther,1,3,"in the third year of his reign he gave a banquet for all his princes and attendants, the army officers of Persia and Media, the nobles and the princes of his provinces being in his presence."
Esther,1,4,"And he displayed the riches of his royal glory and the splendor of his great majesty for many days, 180 days."
Esther,1,5,"When these days were completed, the king gave a banquet lasting seven days for all the people who were present at the citadel in Susa, from the greatest to the least, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace."
Esther,1,6,"There were hangings of fine white and violet linen held by cords of fine purple linen on silver rings and marble columns, and couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl and precious stones."
Esther,1,7,"Drinks were served in golden vessels of various kinds, and the royal wine was plentiful according to the king’s bounty."
Esther,1,8,"The drinking was done according to the law, there was no compulsion, for so the king had given orders to each official of his household that he should do according to the desires of each person."
Esther,1,9,Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the palace which belonged to King Ahasuerus.
Esther,1,10,"On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar and Carkas, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus,"
Esther,1,11,"to bring Queen Vashti before the king with her royal crown in order to display her beauty to the people and the princes, for she was beautiful."
Esther,1,12,But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s command delivered by the eunuchs. Then the king became very angry and his wrath burned within him.
Esther,1,13,Then the king said to the wise men who understood the times—for it was the custom of the king so to speak before all who knew law and justice
Esther,1,14,"and were close to him: Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media who had access to the king’s presence and sat in the first place in the kingdom—"
Esther,1,15,"“According to law, what is to be done with Queen Vashti, because she did not obey the command of King Ahasuerus delivered by the eunuchs?”"
Esther,1,16,"In the presence of the king and the princes, Memucan said, “Queen Vashti has wronged not only the king but also all the princes and all the peoples who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus."
Esther,1,17,"For the queen’s conduct will become known to all the women causing them to look with contempt on their husbands by saying, ‘King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought in to his presence, but she did not come.’"
Esther,1,18,"This day the ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen’s conduct will speak in the same way to all the king’s princes, and there will be plenty of contempt and anger."
Esther,1,19,"If it pleases the king, let a royal edict be issued by him and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media so that it cannot be repealed, that Vashti may no longer come into the presence of King Ahasuerus, and let the king give her royal position to another who is more worthy than she."
Esther,1,20,"When the king’s edict which he will make is heard throughout all his kingdom, great as it is, then all women will give honor to their husbands, great and small.”"
Esther,1,21,"This word pleased the king and the princes, and the king did as Memucan proposed."
Esther,1,22,"So he sent letters to all the king’s provinces, to each province according to its script and to every people according to their language, that every man should be the master in his own house and the one who speaks in the language of his own people."
Esther,2,1,"After these things when the anger of King Ahasuerus had subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what had been decreed against her."
Esther,2,2,"Then the king’s attendants, who served him, said, “Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king."
Esther,2,3,"Let the king appoint overseers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather every beautiful young virgin to the citadel of Susa, to the harem, into the custody of Hegai, the king’s eunuch, who is in charge of the women; and let their cosmetics be given them."
Esther,2,4,"Then let the young lady who pleases the king be queen in place of Vashti.” And the matter pleased the king, and he did accordingly."
Esther,2,5,"Now there was at the citadel in Susa a Jew whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,"
Esther,2,6,"who had been taken into exile from Jerusalem with the captives who had been exiled with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had exiled."
Esther,2,7,"He was bringing up Hadassah, that is Esther, his uncle’s daughter, for she had no father or mother. Now the young lady was beautiful of form and face, and when her father and her mother died, Mordecai took her as his own daughter."
Esther,2,8,"So it came about when the command and decree of the king were heard and many young ladies were gathered to the citadel of Susa into the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken to the king’s palace into the custody of Hegai, who was in charge of the women."
Esther,2,9,"Now the young lady pleased him and found favor with him. So he quickly provided her with her cosmetics and food, gave her seven choice maids from the king’s palace and transferred her and her maids to the best place in the harem."
Esther,2,10,"Esther did not make known her people or her kindred, for Mordecai had instructed her that she should not make them known."
Esther,2,11,Every day Mordecai walked back and forth in front of the court of the harem to learn how Esther was and how she fared.
Esther,2,12,"Now when the turn of each young lady came to go in to King Ahasuerus, after the end of her twelve months under the regulations for the women—for the days of their beautification were completed as follows: six months with oil of myrrh and six months with spices and the cosmetics for women—"
Esther,2,13,the young lady would go in to the king in this way: anything that she desired was given her to take with her from the harem to the king’s palace.
Esther,2,14,"In the evening she would go in and in the morning she would return to the second harem, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch who was in charge of the concubines. She would not again go in to the king unless the king delighted in her and she was summoned by name."
Esther,2,15,"Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai who had taken her as his daughter, came to go in to the king, she did not request anything except what Hegai, the king’s eunuch who was in charge of the women, advised. And Esther found favor in the eyes of all who saw her."
Esther,2,16,"So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus to his royal palace in the tenth month which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign."
Esther,2,17,"The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she found favor and kindness with him more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti."
Esther,2,18,"Then the king gave a great banquet, Esther’s banquet, for all his princes and his servants; he also made a holiday for the provinces and gave gifts according to the king’s bounty."
Esther,2,19,"When the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate."
Esther,2,20,"Esther had not yet made known her kindred or her people, even as Mordecai had commanded her; for Esther did what Mordecai told her as she had done when under his care."
Esther,2,21,"In those days, while Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s officials from those who guarded the door, became angry and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus."
Esther,2,22,"But the plot became known to Mordecai and he told Queen Esther, and Esther informed the king in Mordecai’s name."
Esther,2,23,"Now when the plot was investigated and found to be so, they were both hanged on a gallows; and it was written in the Book of the Chronicles in the king’s presence."
Esther,3,1,"After these events King Ahasuerus promoted Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him and established his authority over all the princes who were with him."
Esther,3,2,All the king’s servants who were at the king’s gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman; for so the king had commanded concerning him. But Mordecai neither bowed down nor paid homage.
Esther,3,3,"Then the king’s servants who were at the king’s gate said to Mordecai, “Why are you transgressing the king’s command?”"
Esther,3,4,"Now it was when they had spoken daily to him and he would not listen to them, that they told Haman to see whether Mordecai’s reason would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew."
Esther,3,5,"When Haman saw that Mordecai neither bowed down nor paid homage to him, Haman was filled with rage."
Esther,3,6,"But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him who the people of Mordecai were; therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus."
Esther,3,7,"In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, Pur, that is the lot, was cast before Haman from day to day and from month to month, until the twelfth month, that is the month Adar."
Esther,3,8,"Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom; their laws are different from those of all other people and they do not observe the king’s laws, so it is not in the king’s interest to let them remain."
Esther,3,9,"If it is pleasing to the king, let it be decreed that they be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who carry on the king’s business, to put into the king’s treasuries.”"
Esther,3,10,"Then the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews."
Esther,3,11,"The king said to Haman, “The silver is yours, and the people also, to do with them as you please.”"
Esther,3,12,"Then the king’s scribes were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and it was written just as Haman commanded to the king’s satraps, to the governors who were over each province and to the princes of each people, each province according to its script, each people according to its language, being written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king’s signet ring."
Esther,3,13,"Letters were sent by couriers to all the king’s provinces to destroy, to kill and to annihilate all the Jews, both young and old, women and children, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to seize their possessions as plunder."
Esther,3,14,A copy of the edict to be issued as law in every province was published to all the peoples so that they should be ready for this day.
Esther,3,15,"The couriers went out impelled by the king’s command while the decree was issued at the citadel in Susa; and while the king and Haman sat down to drink, the city of Susa was in confusion."
Esther,4,1,"When Mordecai learned all that had been done, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the midst of the city and wailed loudly and bitterly."
Esther,4,2,"He went as far as the king’s gate, for no one was to enter the king’s gate clothed in sackcloth."
Esther,4,3,"In each and every province where the command and decree of the king came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping and wailing; and many lay on sackcloth and ashes."
Esther,4,4,"Then Esther’s maidens and her eunuchs came and told her, and the queen writhed in great anguish. And she sent garments to clothe Mordecai that he might remove his sackcloth from him, but he did not accept them."
Esther,4,5,"Then Esther summoned Hathach from the king’s eunuchs, whom the king had appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what this was and why it was."
Esther,4,6,So Hathach went out to Mordecai to the city square in front of the king’s gate.
Esther,4,7,"Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the exact amount of money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the destruction of the Jews."
Esther,4,8,"He also gave him a copy of the text of the edict which had been issued in Susa for their destruction, that he might show Esther and inform her, and to order her to go in to the king to implore his favor and to plead with him for her people."
Esther,4,9,Hathach came back and related Mordecai’s words to Esther.
Esther,4,10,Then Esther spoke to Hathach and ordered him to reply to Mordecai:
Esther,4,11,"“All the king’s servants and the people of the king’s provinces know that for any man or woman who comes to the king to the inner court who is not summoned, he has but one law, that he be put to death, unless the king holds out to him the golden scepter so that he may live. And I have not been summoned to come to the king for these thirty days.”"
Esther,4,12,They related Esther’s words to Mordecai.
Esther,4,13,"Then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, “Do not imagine that you in the king’s palace can escape any more than all the Jews."
Esther,4,14,"For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place and you and your father’s house will perish. And who knows whether you have not attained royalty for such a time as this?”"
Esther,4,15,"Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai,"
Esther,4,16,"“Go, assemble all the Jews who are found in Susa, and fast for me; do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my maidens also will fast in the same way. And thus I will go in to the king, which is not according to the law; and if I perish, I perish.”"
Esther,4,17,So Mordecai went away and did just as Esther had commanded him.
Esther,5,1,"Now it came about on the third day that Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king’s palace in front of the king’s rooms, and the king was sitting on his royal throne in the throne room, opposite the entrance to the palace."
Esther,5,2,"When the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she obtained favor in his sight; and the king extended to Esther the golden scepter which was in his hand. So Esther came near and touched the top of the scepter."
Esther,5,3,"Then the king said to her, “What is troubling you, Queen Esther? And what is your request? Even to half of the kingdom it shall be given to you.”"
Esther,5,4,"Esther said, “If it pleases the king, may the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him.”"
Esther,5,5,"Then the king said, “Bring Haman quickly that we may do as Esther desires.” So the king and Haman came to the banquet which Esther had prepared."
Esther,5,6,"As they drank their wine at the banquet, the king said to Esther, “What is your petition, for it shall be granted to you. And what is your request? Even to half of the kingdom it shall be done.”"
Esther,5,7,"So Esther replied, “My petition and my request is:"
Esther,5,8,"if I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and do what I request, may the king and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as the king says.”"
Esther,5,9,"Then Haman went out that day glad and pleased of heart; but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate and that he did not stand up or tremble before him, Haman was filled with anger against Mordecai."
Esther,5,10,"Haman controlled himself, however, went to his house and sent for his friends and his wife Zeresh."
Esther,5,11,"Then Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, and the number of his sons, and every instance where the king had magnified him and how he had promoted him above the princes and servants of the king."
Esther,5,12,"Haman also said, “Even Esther the queen let no one but me come with the king to the banquet which she had prepared; and tomorrow also I am invited by her with the king."
Esther,5,13,Yet all of this does not satisfy me every time I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.”
Esther,5,14,"Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, “Have a gallows fifty cubits high made and in the morning ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on it; then go joyfully with the king to the banquet.” And the advice pleased Haman, so he had the gallows made."
Esther,6,1,"During that night the king could not sleep so he gave an order to bring the book of records, the chronicles, and they were read before the king."
Esther,6,2,"It was found written what Mordecai had reported concerning Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs who were doorkeepers, that they had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus."
Esther,6,3,"The king said, “What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?” Then the king’s servants who attended him said, “Nothing has been done for him.”"
Esther,6,4,"So the king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king’s palace in order to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows which he had prepared for him."
Esther,6,5,"The king’s servants said to him, “Behold, Haman is standing in the court.” And the king said, “Let him come in.”"
Esther,6,6,"So Haman came in and the king said to him, “What is to be done for the man whom the king desires to honor?” And Haman said to himself, “Whom would the king desire to honor more than me?”"
Esther,6,7,"Then Haman said to the king, “For the man whom the king desires to honor,"
Esther,6,8,"let them bring a royal robe which the king has worn, and the horse on which the king has ridden, and on whose head a royal crown has been placed;"
Esther,6,9,"and let the robe and the horse be handed over to one of the king’s most noble princes and let them array the man whom the king desires to honor and lead him on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him, ‘Thus it shall be done to the man whom the king desires to honor.’”"
Esther,6,10,"Then the king said to Haman, “Take quickly the robes and the horse as you have said, and do so for Mordecai the Jew, who is sitting at the king’s gate; do not fall short in anything of all that you have said.”"
Esther,6,11,"So Haman took the robe and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and led him on horseback through the city square, and proclaimed before him, “Thus it shall be done to the man whom the king desires to honor.”"
Esther,6,12,"Then Mordecai returned to the king’s gate. But Haman hurried home, mourning, with his head covered."
Esther,6,13,"Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, “If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish origin, you will not overcome him, but will surely fall before him.”"
Esther,6,14,"While they were still talking with him, the king’s eunuchs arrived and hastily brought Haman to the banquet which Esther had prepared."
Esther,7,1,Now the king and Haman came to drink wine with Esther the queen.
Esther,7,2,"And the king said to Esther on the second day also as they drank their wine at the banquet, “What is your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to half of the kingdom it shall be done.”"
Esther,7,3,"Then Queen Esther replied, “If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me as my petition, and my people as my request;"
Esther,7,4,"for we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be killed and to be annihilated. Now if we had only been sold as slaves, men and women, I would have remained silent, for the trouble would not be commensurate with the annoyance to the king.”"
Esther,7,5,"Then King Ahasuerus asked Queen Esther, “Who is he, and where is he, who would presume to do thus?”"
Esther,7,6,"Esther said, “A foe and an enemy is this wicked Haman!” Then Haman became terrified before the king and queen."
Esther,7,7,"The king arose in his anger from drinking wine and went into the palace garden; but Haman stayed to beg for his life from Queen Esther, for he saw that harm had been determined against him by the king."
Esther,7,8,"Now when the king returned from the palace garden into the place where they were drinking wine, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was. Then the king said, “Will he even assault the queen with me in the house?” As the word went out of the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face."
Esther,7,9,"Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs who were before the king said, “Behold indeed, the gallows standing at Haman’s house fifty cubits high, which Haman made for Mordecai who spoke good on behalf of the king!” And the king said, “Hang him on it.”"
Esther,7,10,"So they hanged Haman on the gallows which he had prepared for Mordecai, and the king’s anger subsided."
Esther,8,1,"On that day King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews, to Queen Esther; and Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had disclosed what he was to her."
Esther,8,2,"The king took off his signet ring which he had taken away from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman."
Esther,8,3,"Then Esther spoke again to the king, fell at his feet, wept and implored him to avert the evil scheme of Haman the Agagite and his plot which he had devised against the Jews."
Esther,8,4,The king extended the golden scepter to Esther. So Esther arose and stood before the king.
Esther,8,5,"Then she said, “If it pleases the king and if I have found favor before him and the matter seems proper to the king and I am pleasing in his sight, let it be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the king’s provinces."
Esther,8,6,"For how can I endure to see the calamity which will befall my people, and how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?”"
Esther,8,7,"So King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “Behold, I have given the house of Haman to Esther, and him they have hanged on the gallows because he had stretched out his hands against the Jews."
Esther,8,8,"Now you write to the Jews as you see fit, in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s signet ring; for a decree which is written in the name of the king and sealed with the king’s signet ring may not be revoked.”"
Esther,8,9,"So the king’s scribes were called at that time in the third month (that is, the month Sivan), on the twenty-third day; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews, the satraps, the governors and the princes of the provinces which extended from India to Ethiopia, 127 provinces, to every province according to its script, and to every people according to their language as well as to the Jews according to their script and their language."
Esther,8,10,"He wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king’s signet ring, and sent letters by couriers on horses, riding on steeds sired by the royal stud."
Esther,8,11,"In them the king granted the Jews who were in each and every city the right to assemble and to defend their lives, to destroy, to kill and to annihilate the entire army of any people or province which might attack them, including children and women, and to plunder their spoil,"
Esther,8,12,"on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month (that is, the month Adar)."
Esther,8,13,"A copy of the edict to be issued as law in each and every province was published to all the peoples, so that the Jews would be ready for this day to avenge themselves on their enemies."
Esther,8,14,"The couriers, hastened and impelled by the king’s command, went out, riding on the royal steeds; and the decree was given out at the citadel in Susa."
Esther,8,15,"Then Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal robes of blue and white, with a large crown of gold and a garment of fine linen and purple; and the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced."
Esther,8,16,For the Jews there was light and gladness and joy and honor.
Esther,8,17,"In each and every province and in each and every city, wherever the king’s commandment and his decree arrived, there was gladness and joy for the Jews, a feast and a holiday. And many among the peoples of the land became Jews, for the dread of the Jews had fallen on them."
Esther,9,1,"Now in the twelfth month (that is, the month Adar), on the thirteenth day when the king’s command and edict were about to be executed, on the day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to gain the mastery over them, it was turned to the contrary so that the Jews themselves gained the mastery over those who hated them."
Esther,9,2,"The Jews assembled in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on those who sought their harm; and no one could stand before them, for the dread of them had fallen on all the peoples."
Esther,9,3,"Even all the princes of the provinces, the satraps, the governors and those who were doing the king’s business assisted the Jews, because the dread of Mordecai had fallen on them."
Esther,9,4,"Indeed, Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai became greater and greater."
Esther,9,5,"Thus the Jews struck all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying; and they did what they pleased to those who hated them."
Esther,9,6,"At the citadel in Susa the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men,"
Esther,9,7,"and Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,"
Esther,9,8,"Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,"
Esther,9,9,"Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai and Vaizatha,"
Esther,9,10,"the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews’ enemy; but they did not lay their hands on the plunder."
Esther,9,11,On that day the number of those who were killed at the citadel in Susa was reported to the king.
Esther,9,12,"The king said to Queen Esther, “The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman at the citadel in Susa. What then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now what is your petition? It shall even be granted you. And what is your further request? It shall also be done.”"
Esther,9,13,"Then said Esther, “If it pleases the king, let tomorrow also be granted to the Jews who are in Susa to do according to the edict of today; and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.”"
Esther,9,14,"So the king commanded that it should be done so; and an edict was issued in Susa, and Haman’s ten sons were hanged."
Esther,9,15,"The Jews who were in Susa assembled also on the fourteenth day of the month Adar and killed three hundred men in Susa, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder."
Esther,9,16,"Now the rest of the Jews who were in the king’s provinces assembled, to defend their lives and rid themselves of their enemies, and kill 75,000 of those who hated them; but they did not lay their hands on the plunder."
Esther,9,17,"This was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar, and on the fourteenth day they rested and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing."
Esther,9,18,"But the Jews who were in Susa assembled on the thirteenth and the fourteenth of the same month, and they rested on the fifteenth day and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing."
Esther,9,19,"Therefore the Jews of the rural areas, who live in the rural towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a holiday for rejoicing and feasting and sending portions of food to one another."
Esther,9,20,"Then Mordecai recorded these events, and he sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far,"
Esther,9,21,"obliging them to celebrate the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same month, annually,"
Esther,9,22,"because on those days the Jews rid themselves of their enemies, and it was a month which was turned for them from sorrow into gladness and from mourning into a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and rejoicing and sending portions of food to one another and gifts to the poor."
Esther,9,23,"Thus the Jews undertook what they had started to do, and what Mordecai had written to them."
Esther,9,24,"For Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the adversary of all the Jews, had schemed against the Jews to destroy them and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to disturb them and destroy them."
Esther,9,25,"But when it came to the king’s attention, he commanded by letter that his wicked scheme which he had devised against the Jews, should return on his own head and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows."
Esther,9,26,"Therefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. And because of the instructions in this letter, both what they had seen in this regard and what had happened to them,"
Esther,9,27,"the Jews established and made a custom for themselves and for their descendants and for all those who allied themselves with them, so that they would not fail to celebrate these two days according to their regulation and according to their appointed time annually."
Esther,9,28,"So these days were to be remembered and celebrated throughout every generation, every family, every province and every city; and these days of Purim were not to fail from among the Jews, or their memory fade from their descendants."
Esther,9,29,"Then Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter about Purim."
Esther,9,30,"He sent letters to all the Jews, to the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, namely, words of peace and truth,"
Esther,9,31,"to establish these days of Purim at their appointed times, just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established for them, and just as they had established for themselves and for their descendants with instructions for their times of fasting and their lamentations."
Esther,9,32,"The command of Esther established these customs for Purim, and it was written in the book."
Esther,10,1,Now King Ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land and on the coastlands of the sea.
Esther,10,2,"And all the accomplishments of his authority and strength, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia?"
Esther,10,3,"For Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews and in favor with his many kinsmen, one who sought the good of his people and one who spoke for the welfare of his whole nation."

Proverbs,31,17,She girds herself with strength And makes her arms strong.
Proverbs,31,18,She senses that her gain is good; Her lamp does not go out at night.
Proverbs,31,19,"She stretches out her hands to the distaff, And her hands grasp the spindle."
Proverbs,31,20,"She extends her hand to the poor, And she stretches out her hands to the needy."
Proverbs,31,21,"She is not afraid of the snow for her household, For all her household are clothed with scarlet."
Proverbs,31,22,She makes coverings for herself; Her clothing is fine linen and purple.
Proverbs,31,23,"Her husband is known in the gates, When he sits among the elders of the land."
Proverbs,31,24,"She makes linen garments and sells them, And supplies belts to the tradesmen."
Proverbs,31,25,"Strength and dignity are her clothing, And she smiles at the future."
Proverbs,31,26,"She opens her mouth in wisdom, And the teaching of kindness is on her tongue."
Proverbs,31,27,"She looks well to the ways of her household, And does not eat the bread of idleness."
Proverbs,31,28,"Her children rise up and bless her; Her husband also, and he praises her, saying:"
Proverbs,31,29,"“Many daughters have done nobly, But you excel them all.”"
Proverbs,31,30,"Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, But a woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised."
Proverbs,31,31,"Give her the product of her hands, And let her works praise her in the gates."
Ecclesiastes,1,1,"The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem."
Ecclesiastes,1,2,"“Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher, “Vanity of vanities! All is vanity.”"
Ecclesiastes,1,3,What advantage does man have in all his work Which he does under the sun?
Ecclesiastes,1,4,"A generation goes and a generation comes, But the earth remains forever."
Ecclesiastes,1,5,"Also, the sun rises and the sun sets; And hastening to its place it rises there again."
Ecclesiastes,1,6,"Blowing toward the south, Then turning toward the north, The wind continues swirling along; And on its circular courses the wind returns."
Ecclesiastes,1,7,"All the rivers flow into the sea, Yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, There they flow again."
Ecclesiastes,1,8,"All things are wearisome; Man is not able to tell it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, Nor is the ear filled with hearing."
Ecclesiastes,1,9,"That which has been is that which will be, And that which has been done is that which will be done. So there is nothing new under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,1,10,"Is there anything of which one might say, “See this, it is new”? Already it has existed for ages Which were before us."
Ecclesiastes,1,11,"There is no remembrance of earlier things; And also of the later things which will occur, There will be for them no remembrance Among those who will come later still."
Ecclesiastes,1,12,"I, the Preacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem."
Ecclesiastes,1,13,And I set my mind to seek and explore by wisdom concerning all that has been done under heaven. It is a grievous task which God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.
Ecclesiastes,1,14,"I have seen all the works which have been done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and striving after wind."
Ecclesiastes,1,15,What is crooked cannot be straightened and what is lacking cannot be counted.
Ecclesiastes,1,16,"I said to myself, “Behold, I have magnified and increased wisdom more than all who were over Jerusalem before me; and my mind has observed a wealth of wisdom and knowledge.”"
Ecclesiastes,1,17,And I set my mind to know wisdom and to know madness and folly; I realized that this also is striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes,1,18,"Because in much wisdom there is much grief, and increasing knowledge results in increasing pain."
Ecclesiastes,2,1,"I said to myself, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure. So enjoy yourself.” And behold, it too was futility."
Ecclesiastes,2,2,"I said of laughter, “It is madness,” and of pleasure, “What does it accomplish?”"
Ecclesiastes,2,3,"I explored with my mind how to stimulate my body with wine while my mind was guiding me wisely, and how to take hold of folly, until I could see what good there is for the sons of men to do under heaven the few years of their lives."
Ecclesiastes,2,4,"I enlarged my works: I built houses for myself, I planted vineyards for myself;"
Ecclesiastes,2,5,I made gardens and parks for myself and I planted in them all kinds of fruit trees;
Ecclesiastes,2,6,I made ponds of water for myself from which to irrigate a forest of growing trees.
Ecclesiastes,2,7,I bought male and female slaves and I had homeborn slaves. Also I possessed flocks and herds larger than all who preceded me in Jerusalem.
Ecclesiastes,2,8,"Also, I collected for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces. I provided for myself male and female singers and the pleasures of men—many concubines."
Ecclesiastes,2,9,Then I became great and increased more than all who preceded me in Jerusalem. My wisdom also stood by me.
Ecclesiastes,2,10,"All that my eyes desired I did not refuse them. I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure, for my heart was pleased because of all my labor and this was my reward for all my labor."
Ecclesiastes,2,11,"Thus I considered all my activities which my hands had done and the labor which I had exerted, and behold all was vanity and striving after wind and there was no profit under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,2,12,"So I turned to consider wisdom, madness and folly; for what will the man do who will come after the king except what has already been done?"
Ecclesiastes,2,13,And I saw that wisdom excels folly as light excels darkness.
Ecclesiastes,2,14,"The wise man’s eyes are in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. And yet I know that one fate befalls them both."
Ecclesiastes,2,15,"Then I said to myself, “As is the fate of the fool, it will also befall me. Why then have I been extremely wise?” So I said to myself, “This too is vanity.”"
Ecclesiastes,2,16,"For there is no lasting remembrance of the wise man as with the fool, inasmuch as in the coming days all will be forgotten. And how the wise man and the fool alike die!"
Ecclesiastes,2,17,"So I hated life, for the work which had been done under the sun was grievous to me; because everything is futility and striving after wind."
Ecclesiastes,2,18,"Thus I hated all the fruit of my labor for which I had labored under the sun, for I must leave it to the man who will come after me."
Ecclesiastes,2,19,And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have control over all the fruit of my labor for which I have labored by acting wisely under the sun. This too is vanity.
Ecclesiastes,2,20,Therefore I completely despaired of all the fruit of my labor for which I had labored under the sun.
Ecclesiastes,2,21,"When there is a man who has labored with wisdom, knowledge and skill, then he gives his legacy to one who has not labored with them. This too is vanity and a great evil."
Ecclesiastes,2,22,For what does a man get in all his labor and in his striving with which he labors under the sun?
Ecclesiastes,2,23,Because all his days his task is painful and grievous; even at night his mind does not rest. This too is vanity.
Ecclesiastes,2,24,There is nothing better for a man than to eat and drink and tell himself that his labor is good. This also I have seen that it is from the hand of God.
Ecclesiastes,2,25,For who can eat and who can have enjoyment without Him?
Ecclesiastes,2,26,"For to a person who is good in His sight He has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, while to the sinner He has given the task of gathering and collecting so that he may give to one who is good in God’s sight. This too is vanity and striving after wind."
Ecclesiastes,3,1,There is an appointed time for everything. And there is a time for every event under heaven—
Ecclesiastes,3,2,A time to give birth and a time to die; A time to plant and a time to uproot what is planted.
Ecclesiastes,3,3,A time to kill and a time to heal; A time to tear down and a time to build up.
Ecclesiastes,3,4,A time to weep and a time to laugh; A time to mourn and a time to dance.
Ecclesiastes,3,5,A time to throw stones and a time to gather stones; A time to embrace and a time to shun embracing.
Ecclesiastes,3,6,A time to search and a time to give up as lost; A time to keep and a time to throw away.
Ecclesiastes,3,7,A time to tear apart and a time to sew together; A time to be silent and a time to speak.
Ecclesiastes,3,8,A time to love and a time to hate; A time for war and a time for peace.
Ecclesiastes,3,9,What profit is there to the worker from that in which he toils?
Ecclesiastes,3,10,I have seen the task which God has given the sons of men with which to occupy themselves.
Ecclesiastes,3,11,"He has made everything appropriate in its time. He has also set eternity in their heart, yet so that man will not find out the work which God has done from the beginning even to the end."
Ecclesiastes,3,12,I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and to do good in one’s lifetime;
Ecclesiastes,3,13,"moreover, that every man who eats and drinks sees good in all his labor—it is the gift of God."
Ecclesiastes,3,14,"I know that everything God does will remain forever; there is nothing to add to it and there is nothing to take from it, for God has so worked that men should fear Him."
Ecclesiastes,3,15,"That which is has been already and that which will be has already been, for God seeks what has passed by."
Ecclesiastes,3,16,"Furthermore, I have seen under the sun that in the place of justice there is wickedness and in the place of righteousness there is wickedness."
Ecclesiastes,3,17,"I said to myself, “God will judge both the righteous man and the wicked man,” for a time for every matter and for every deed is there."
Ecclesiastes,3,18,"I said to myself concerning the sons of men, “God has surely tested them in order for them to see that they are but beasts.”"
Ecclesiastes,3,19,"For the fate of the sons of men and the fate of beasts is the same. As one dies so dies the other; indeed, they all have the same breath and there is no advantage for man over beast, for all is vanity."
Ecclesiastes,3,20,All go to the same place. All came from the dust and all return to the dust.
Ecclesiastes,3,21,Who knows that the breath of man ascends upward and the breath of the beast descends downward to the earth?
Ecclesiastes,3,22,"I have seen that nothing is better than that man should be happy in his activities, for that is his lot. For who will bring him to see what will occur after him?"
Ecclesiastes,4,1,"Then I looked again at all the acts of oppression which were being done under the sun. And behold I saw the tears of the oppressed and that they had no one to comfort them; and on the side of their oppressors was power, but they had no one to comfort them."
Ecclesiastes,4,2,So I congratulated the dead who are already dead more than the living who are still living.
Ecclesiastes,4,3,"But better off than both of them is the one who has never existed, who has never seen the evil activity that is done under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,4,4,I have seen that every labor and every skill which is done is the result of rivalry between a man and his neighbor. This too is vanity and striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes,4,5,The fool folds his hands and consumes his own flesh.
Ecclesiastes,4,6,One hand full of rest is better than two fists full of labor and striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes,4,7,Then I looked again at vanity under the sun.
Ecclesiastes,4,8,"There was a certain man without a dependent, having neither a son nor a brother, yet there was no end to all his labor. Indeed, his eyes were not satisfied with riches and he never asked, “And for whom am I laboring and depriving myself of pleasure?” This too is vanity and it is a grievous task."
Ecclesiastes,4,9,Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor.
Ecclesiastes,4,10,"For if either of them falls, the one will lift up his companion. But woe to the one who falls when there is not another to lift him up."
Ecclesiastes,4,11,"Furthermore, if two lie down together they keep warm, but how can one be warm alone?"
Ecclesiastes,4,12,"And if one can overpower him who is alone, two can resist him. A cord of three strands is not quickly torn apart."
Ecclesiastes,4,13,A poor yet wise lad is better than an old and foolish king who no longer knows how to receive instruction.
Ecclesiastes,4,14,"For he has come out of prison to become king, even though he was born poor in his kingdom."
Ecclesiastes,4,15,I have seen all the living under the sun throng to the side of the second lad who replaces him.
Ecclesiastes,4,16,"There is no end to all the people, to all who were before them, and even the ones who will come later will not be happy with him, for this too is vanity and striving after wind."
Ecclesiastes,5,1,Guard your steps as you go to the house of God and draw near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools; for they do not know they are doing evil.
Ecclesiastes,5,2,Do not be hasty in word or impulsive in thought to bring up a matter in the presence of God. For God is in heaven and you are on the earth; therefore let your words be few.
Ecclesiastes,5,3,For the dream comes through much effort and the voice of a fool through many words.
Ecclesiastes,5,4,"When you make a vow to God, do not be late in paying it; for He takes no delight in fools. Pay what you vow!"
Ecclesiastes,5,5,It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay.
Ecclesiastes,5,6,Do not let your speech cause you to sin and do not say in the presence of the messenger of God that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry on account of your voice and destroy the work of your hands?
Ecclesiastes,5,7,"For in many dreams and in many words there is emptiness. Rather, fear God."
Ecclesiastes,5,8,"If you see oppression of the poor and denial of justice and righteousness in the province, do not be shocked at the sight; for one official watches over another official, and there are higher officials over them."
Ecclesiastes,5,9,"After all, a king who cultivates the field is an advantage to the land."
Ecclesiastes,5,10,"He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves abundance with its income. This too is vanity."
Ecclesiastes,5,11,"When good things increase, those who consume them increase. So what is the advantage to their owners except to look on?"
Ecclesiastes,5,12,"The sleep of the working man is pleasant, whether he eats little or much; but the full stomach of the rich man does not allow him to sleep."
Ecclesiastes,5,13,There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun: riches being hoarded by their owner to his hurt.
Ecclesiastes,5,14,"When those riches were lost through a bad investment and he had fathered a son, then there was nothing to support him."
Ecclesiastes,5,15,"As he had come naked from his mother’s womb, so will he return as he came. He will take nothing from the fruit of his labor that he can carry in his hand."
Ecclesiastes,5,16,"This also is a grievous evil—exactly as a man is born, thus will he die. So what is the advantage to him who toils for the wind?"
Ecclesiastes,5,17,"Throughout his life he also eats in darkness with great vexation, sickness and anger."
Ecclesiastes,5,18,"Here is what I have seen to be good and fitting: to eat, to drink and enjoy oneself in all one’s labor in which he toils under the sun during the few years of his life which God has given him; for this is his reward."
Ecclesiastes,5,19,"Furthermore, as for every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, He has also empowered him to eat from them and to receive his reward and rejoice in his labor; this is the gift of God."
Ecclesiastes,5,20,"For he will not often consider the years of his life, because God keeps him occupied with the gladness of his heart."
Ecclesiastes,6,1,There is an evil which I have seen under the sun and it is prevalent among men—
Ecclesiastes,6,2,"a man to whom God has given riches and wealth and honor so that his soul lacks nothing of all that he desires; yet God has not empowered him to eat from them, for a foreigner enjoys them. This is vanity and a severe affliction."
Ecclesiastes,6,3,"If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, however many they be, but his soul is not satisfied with good things and he does not even have a proper burial, then I say, “Better the miscarriage than he,"
Ecclesiastes,6,4,for it comes in futility and goes into obscurity; and its name is covered in obscurity.
Ecclesiastes,6,5,It never sees the sun and it never knows anything; it is better off than he.
Ecclesiastes,6,6,Even if the other man lives a thousand years twice and does not enjoy good things—do not all go to one place?”
Ecclesiastes,6,7,All a man’s labor is for his mouth and yet the appetite is not satisfied.
Ecclesiastes,6,8,"For what advantage does the wise man have over the fool? What advantage does the poor man have, knowing how to walk before the living?"
Ecclesiastes,6,9,What the eyes see is better than what the soul desires. This too is futility and a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes,6,10,"Whatever exists has already been named, and it is known what man is; for he cannot dispute with him who is stronger than he is."
Ecclesiastes,6,11,For there are many words which increase futility. What then is the advantage to a man?
Ecclesiastes,6,12,"For who knows what is good for a man during his lifetime, during the few years of his futile life? He will spend them like a shadow. For who can tell a man what will be after him under the sun?"
Ecclesiastes,7,1,"A good name is better than a good ointment, And the day of one’s death is better than the day of one’s birth."
Ecclesiastes,7,2,"It is better to go to a house of mourning Than to go to a house of feasting, Because that is the end of every man, And the living takes it to heart."
Ecclesiastes,7,3,"Sorrow is better than laughter, For when a face is sad a heart may be happy."
Ecclesiastes,7,4,"The mind of the wise is in the house of mourning, While the mind of fools is in the house of pleasure."
Ecclesiastes,7,5,It is better to listen to the rebuke of a wise man Than for one to listen to the song of fools.
Ecclesiastes,7,6,"For as the crackling of thorn bushes under a pot, So is the laughter of the fool; And this too is futility."
Ecclesiastes,7,7,"For oppression makes a wise man mad, And a bribe corrupts the heart."
Ecclesiastes,7,8,The end of a matter is better than its beginning; Patience of spirit is better than haughtiness of spirit.
Ecclesiastes,7,9,"Do not be eager in your heart to be angry, For anger resides in the bosom of fools."
Ecclesiastes,7,10,"Do not say, “Why is it that the former days were better than these?” For it is not from wisdom that you ask about this."
Ecclesiastes,7,11,Wisdom along with an inheritance is good And an advantage to those who see the sun.
Ecclesiastes,7,12,"For wisdom is protection just as money is protection, But the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the lives of its possessors."
Ecclesiastes,7,13,"Consider the work of God, For who is able to straighten what He has bent?"
Ecclesiastes,7,14,"In the day of prosperity be happy, But in the day of adversity consider— God has made the one as well as the other So that man will not discover anything that will be after him."
Ecclesiastes,7,15,I have seen everything during my lifetime of futility; there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his wickedness.
Ecclesiastes,7,16,Do not be excessively righteous and do not be overly wise. Why should you ruin yourself?
Ecclesiastes,7,17,Do not be excessively wicked and do not be a fool. Why should you die before your time?
Ecclesiastes,7,18,It is good that you grasp one thing and also not let go of the other; for the one who fears God comes forth with both of them.
Ecclesiastes,7,19,Wisdom strengthens a wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city.
Ecclesiastes,7,20,"Indeed, there is not a righteous man on earth who continually does good and who never sins."
Ecclesiastes,7,21,"Also, do not take seriously all words which are spoken, so that you will not hear your servant cursing you."
Ecclesiastes,7,22,For you also have realized that you likewise have many times cursed others.
Ecclesiastes,7,23,"I tested all this with wisdom, and I said, “I will be wise,” but it was far from me."
Ecclesiastes,7,24,What has been is remote and exceedingly mysterious. Who can discover it?
Ecclesiastes,7,25,"I directed my mind to know, to investigate and to seek wisdom and an explanation, and to know the evil of folly and the foolishness of madness."
Ecclesiastes,7,26,"And I discovered more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, whose hands are chains. One who is pleasing to God will escape from her, but the sinner will be captured by her."
Ecclesiastes,7,27,"“Behold, I have discovered this,” says the Preacher, “adding one thing to another to find an explanation,"
Ecclesiastes,7,28,"which I am still seeking but have not found. I have found one man among a thousand, but I have not found a woman among all these."
Ecclesiastes,7,29,"Behold, I have found only this, that God made men upright, but they have sought out many devices.”"
Ecclesiastes,8,1,Who is like the wise man and who knows the interpretation of a matter? A man’s wisdom illumines him and causes his stern face to beam.
Ecclesiastes,8,2,"I say, “Keep the command of the king because of the oath before God."
Ecclesiastes,8,3,"Do not be in a hurry to leave him. Do not join in an evil matter, for he will do whatever he pleases.”"
Ecclesiastes,8,4,"Since the word of the king is authoritative, who will say to him, “What are you doing?”"
Ecclesiastes,8,5,"He who keeps a royal command experiences no trouble, for a wise heart knows the proper time and procedure."
Ecclesiastes,8,6,"For there is a proper time and procedure for every delight, though a man’s trouble is heavy upon him."
Ecclesiastes,8,7,"If no one knows what will happen, who can tell him when it will happen?"
Ecclesiastes,8,8,"No man has authority to restrain the wind with the wind, or authority over the day of death; and there is no discharge in the time of war, and evil will not deliver those who practice it."
Ecclesiastes,8,9,All this I have seen and applied my mind to every deed that has been done under the sun wherein a man has exercised authority over another man to his hurt.
Ecclesiastes,8,10,"So then, I have seen the wicked buried, those who used to go in and out from the holy place, and they are soon forgotten in the city where they did thus. This too is futility."
Ecclesiastes,8,11,"Because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed quickly, therefore the hearts of the sons of men among them are given fully to do evil."
Ecclesiastes,8,12,"Although a sinner does evil a hundred times and may lengthen his life, still I know that it will be well for those who fear God, who fear Him openly."
Ecclesiastes,8,13,"But it will not be well for the evil man and he will not lengthen his days like a shadow, because he does not fear God."
Ecclesiastes,8,14,"There is futility which is done on the earth, that is, there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked. On the other hand, there are evil men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous. I say that this too is futility."
Ecclesiastes,8,15,"So I commended pleasure, for there is nothing good for a man under the sun except to eat and to drink and to be merry, and this will stand by him in his toils throughout the days of his life which God has given him under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,8,16,"When I gave my heart to know wisdom and to see the task which has been done on the earth (even though one should never sleep day or night),"
Ecclesiastes,8,17,"and I saw every work of God, I concluded that man cannot discover the work which has been done under the sun. Even though man should seek laboriously, he will not discover; and though the wise man should say, “I know,” he cannot discover."
Ecclesiastes,9,1,"For I have taken all this to my heart and explain it that righteous men, wise men, and their deeds are in the hand of God. Man does not know whether it will be love or hatred; anything awaits him."
Ecclesiastes,9,2,"It is the same for all. There is one fate for the righteous and for the wicked; for the good, for the clean and for the unclean; for the man who offers a sacrifice and for the one who does not sacrifice. As the good man is, so is the sinner; as the swearer is, so is the one who is afraid to swear."
Ecclesiastes,9,3,"This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one fate for all men. Furthermore, the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil and insanity is in their hearts throughout their lives. Afterwards they go to the dead."
Ecclesiastes,9,4,"For whoever is joined with all the living, there is hope; surely a live dog is better than a dead lion."
Ecclesiastes,9,5,"For the living know they will die; but the dead do not know anything, nor have they any longer a reward, for their memory is forgotten."
Ecclesiastes,9,6,"Indeed their love, their hate and their zeal have already perished, and they will no longer have a share in all that is done under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,9,7,"Go then, eat your bread in happiness and drink your wine with a cheerful heart; for God has already approved your works."
Ecclesiastes,9,8,"Let your clothes be white all the time, and let not oil be lacking on your head."
Ecclesiastes,9,9,Enjoy life with the woman whom you love all the days of your fleeting life which He has given to you under the sun; for this is your reward in life and in your toil in which you have labored under the sun.
Ecclesiastes,9,10,"Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might; for there is no activity or planning or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol where you are going."
Ecclesiastes,9,11,"I again saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift and the battle is not to the warriors, and neither is bread to the wise nor wealth to the discerning nor favor to men of ability; for time and chance overtake them all."
Ecclesiastes,9,12,"Moreover, man does not know his time: like fish caught in a treacherous net and birds trapped in a snare, so the sons of men are ensnared at an evil time when it suddenly falls on them."
Ecclesiastes,9,13,"Also this I came to see as wisdom under the sun, and it impressed me."
Ecclesiastes,9,14,"There was a small city with few men in it and a great king came to it, surrounded it and constructed large siegeworks against it."
Ecclesiastes,9,15,But there was found in it a poor wise man and he delivered the city by his wisdom. Yet no one remembered that poor man.
Ecclesiastes,9,16,"So I said, “Wisdom is better than strength.” But the wisdom of the poor man is despised and his words are not heeded."
Ecclesiastes,9,17,The words of the wise heard in quietness are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools.
Ecclesiastes,9,18,"Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good."
Ecclesiastes,10,1,"Dead flies make a perfumer’s oil stink, so a little foolishness is weightier than wisdom and honor."
Ecclesiastes,10,2,"A wise man’s heart directs him toward the right, but the foolish man’s heart directs him toward the left."
Ecclesiastes,10,3,"Even when the fool walks along the road, his sense is lacking and he demonstrates to everyone that he is a fool."
Ecclesiastes,10,4,"If the ruler’s temper rises against you, do not abandon your position, because composure allays great offenses."
Ecclesiastes,10,5,"There is an evil I have seen under the sun, like an error which goes forth from the ruler—"
Ecclesiastes,10,6,folly is set in many exalted places while rich men sit in humble places.
Ecclesiastes,10,7,I have seen slaves riding on horses and princes walking like slaves on the land.
Ecclesiastes,10,8,"He who digs a pit may fall into it, and a serpent may bite him who breaks through a wall."
Ecclesiastes,10,9,"He who quarries stones may be hurt by them, and he who splits logs may be endangered by them."
Ecclesiastes,10,10,"If the axe is dull and he does not sharpen its edge, then he must exert more strength. Wisdom has the advantage of giving success."
Ecclesiastes,10,11,"If the serpent bites before being charmed, there is no profit for the charmer."
Ecclesiastes,10,12,"Words from the mouth of a wise man are gracious, while the lips of a fool consume him;"
Ecclesiastes,10,13,the beginning of his talking is folly and the end of it is wicked madness.
Ecclesiastes,10,14,"Yet the fool multiplies words. No man knows what will happen, and who can tell him what will come after him?"
Ecclesiastes,10,15,The toil of a fool so wearies him that he does not even know how to go to a city.
Ecclesiastes,10,16,"Woe to you, O land, whose king is a lad and whose princes feast in the morning."
Ecclesiastes,10,17,"Blessed are you, O land, whose king is of nobility and whose princes eat at the appropriate time—for strength and not for drunkenness."
Ecclesiastes,10,18,"Through indolence the rafters sag, and through slackness the house leaks."
Ecclesiastes,10,19,"Men prepare a meal for enjoyment, and wine makes life merry, and money is the answer to everything."
Ecclesiastes,10,20,"Furthermore, in your bedchamber do not curse a king, and in your sleeping rooms do not curse a rich man, for a bird of the heavens will carry the sound and the winged creature will make the matter known."
Ecclesiastes,11,1,"Cast your bread on the surface of the waters, for you will find it after many days."
Ecclesiastes,11,2,"Divide your portion to seven, or even to eight, for you do not know what misfortune may occur on the earth."
Ecclesiastes,11,3,"If the clouds are full, they pour out rain upon the earth; and whether a tree falls toward the south or toward the north, wherever the tree falls, there it lies."
Ecclesiastes,11,4,He who watches the wind will not sow and he who looks at the clouds will not reap.
Ecclesiastes,11,5,"Just as you do not know the path of the wind and how bones are formed in the womb of the pregnant woman, so you do not know the activity of God who makes all things."
Ecclesiastes,11,6,"Sow your seed in the morning and do not be idle in the evening, for you do not know whether morning or evening sowing will succeed, or whether both of them alike will be good."
