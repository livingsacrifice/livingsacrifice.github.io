Isaiah,7,4,"Say to him: Calm down and be quiet. Don’t be afraid or cowardly because of these two smoldering stubs of firebrands, the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram, and the son of Remaliah."
Isaiah,7,5,"For Aram, along with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has plotted harm against you. They say,"
Isaiah,7,6,"‘Let us go up against Judah, terrorize it, and conquer it for ourselves. Then we can install Tabeel’s son as king in it.’”"
Isaiah,7,7,This is what the Lord GOD says: It will not happen; it will not occur.
Isaiah,7,8,"The head of Aram is Damascus, the head of Damascus is Rezin (within 65 years Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people),"
Isaiah,7,9,"the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you do not stand firm in your faith, then you will not stand at all."
Isaiah,7,10,Then the LORD spoke again to Ahaz:
Isaiah,7,11,“Ask for a sign from the LORD your God—from the depths of Sheol to the heights of heaven.”
Isaiah,7,12,"But Ahaz replied, “I will not ask. I will not test the LORD.”"
Isaiah,7,13,"Isaiah said, “Listen, house of David! Is it not enough for you to try the patience of men? Will you also try the patience of my God?"
Isaiah,7,14,"Therefore, the Lord Himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive, have a son, and name him Immanuel."
Isaiah,7,15,"By the time he learns to reject what is bad and choose what is good, he will be eating butter and honey."
Isaiah,7,16,"For before the boy knows to reject what is bad and choose what is good, the land of the two kings you dread will be abandoned."
Isaiah,7,17,"The LORD will bring on you, your people, and the house of your father, such a time as has never been since Ephraim separated from Judah—the king of Assyria is coming.”"
Isaiah,7,18,On that day the LORD will whistle to the fly that is at the farthest streams of the Nile and to the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
Isaiah,7,19,"All of them will come and settle in the steep ravines, in the clefts of the rocks, in all the thornbushes, and in all the water holes."
Isaiah,7,20,"On that day the Lord will use a razor hired from beyond the Euphrates River—the king of Assyria—to shave the head, the hair on the legs, and to remove the beard as well."
Isaiah,7,21,"On that day a man will raise a young cow and two sheep,"
Isaiah,7,22,"and from the abundant milk they give he will eat butter, for every survivor in the land will eat butter and honey."
Isaiah,7,23,"And on that day every place where there were 1,000 vines, worth 1,000 pieces of silver, will become thorns and briers."
Isaiah,7,24,A man will go there with bow and arrows because the whole land will be thorns and briers.
Isaiah,7,25,"You will not go to all the hills that were once tilled with a hoe, for fear of the thorns and briers. Those hills will be places for oxen to graze and for sheep to trample."
Isaiah,8,1,"Then the LORD said to me, “Take a large piece of parchment and write on it with an ordinary pen: Maher-shalal-hash-baz."
Isaiah,8,2,I have appointed trustworthy witnesses—Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah.”
Isaiah,8,3,"I was then intimate with the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. The LORD said to me, “Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz,"
Isaiah,8,4,"for before the boy knows how to call out father or mother, the wealth of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria will be carried off to the king of Assyria.”"
Isaiah,8,5,The LORD spoke to me again:
Isaiah,8,6,"Because these people rejected the slowly flowing waters of Shiloah and rejoiced with Rezin and the son of Remaliah,"
Isaiah,8,7,the Lord will certainly bring against them the mighty rushing waters of the Euphrates River— the king of Assyria and all his glory. It will overflow its channels and spill over all its banks.
Isaiah,8,8,"It will pour into Judah, flood over it, and sweep through, reaching up to the neck; and its spreading streams will fill your entire land, Immanuel!"
Isaiah,8,9,"Band together, peoples, and be broken; pay attention, all you distant lands; prepare for war, and be broken; prepare for war, and be broken."
Isaiah,8,10,Devise a plan; it will fail. Make a prediction; it will not happen. For God is with us.
Isaiah,8,11,"For this is what the LORD said to me with great power, to keep me from going the way of this people:"
Isaiah,8,12,Do not call everything an alliance these people say is an alliance. Do not fear what they fear; do not be terrified.
Isaiah,8,13,You are to regard only the LORD of Hosts as holy. Only He should be feared; only He should be held in awe.
Isaiah,8,14,"He will be a sanctuary; but for the two houses of Israel, He will be a stone to stumble over and a rock to trip over, and a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
Isaiah,8,15,Many will stumble over these; they will fall and be broken; they will be snared and captured.
Isaiah,8,16,Bind up the testimony. Seal up the instruction among my disciples.
Isaiah,8,17,"I will wait for the LORD, who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob. I will wait for Him."
Isaiah,8,18,Here I am with the children the LORD has given me to be signs and wonders in Israel from the LORD of Hosts who dwells on Mount Zion.
Isaiah,8,19,"When they say to you, “Consult the spirits of the dead and the spiritists who chirp and mutter,” shouldn’t a people consult their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living?"
Isaiah,8,20,"To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, there will be no dawn for them."
Isaiah,8,21,"They will wander through the land, dejected and hungry. When they are famished, they will become enraged, and, looking upward, will curse their king and their God."
Isaiah,8,22,"They will look toward the earth and see only distress, darkness, and the gloom of affliction, and they will be driven into thick darkness."
Isaiah,9,1,"Nevertheless, the gloom of the distressed land will not be like that of the former times when He humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali. But in the future He will bring honor to the Way of the Sea, to the land east of the Jordan, and to Galilee of the nations."
Isaiah,9,2,The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; a light has dawned on those living in the land of darkness.
Isaiah,9,3,You have enlarged the nation and increased its joy. The people have rejoiced before You as they rejoice at harvest time and as they rejoice when dividing spoils.
Isaiah,9,4,"For You have shattered their oppressive yoke and the rod on their shoulders, the staff of their oppressor, just as You did on the day of Midian."
Isaiah,9,5,For the trampling boot of battle and the bloodied garments of war will be burned as fuel for the fire.
Isaiah,9,6,"For a child will be born for us, a son will be given to us, and the government will be on His shoulders. He will be named Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace."
Isaiah,9,7,"The dominion will be vast, and its prosperity will never end. He will reign on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish and sustain it with justice and righteousness from now on and forever. The zeal of the LORD of Hosts will accomplish this."
Isaiah,9,8,The Lord sent a message against Jacob; it came against Israel.
Isaiah,9,9,All the people— Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria—will know it. They will say with pride and arrogance:
Isaiah,9,10,"“The bricks have fallen, but we will rebuild with cut stones; the sycamores have been cut down, but we will replace them with cedars.”"
Isaiah,9,11,The LORD has raised up Rezin’s adversaries against him and stirred up his enemies.
Isaiah,9,12,"Aram from the east and Philistia from the west have consumed Israel with open mouths. In all this, His anger is not removed, and His hand is still raised to strike."
Isaiah,9,13,The people did not turn to Him who struck them; they did not seek the LORD of Hosts.
Isaiah,9,14,"So the LORD cut off Israel’s head and tail, palm branch and reed in a single day."
Isaiah,9,15,"The head is the elder, the honored one; the tail is the prophet, the lying teacher."
Isaiah,9,16,"The leaders of the people mislead them, and those they mislead are swallowed up."
Isaiah,9,17,"Therefore the Lord does not rejoice over Israel’s young men and has no compassion on its fatherless and widows, for everyone is a godless evildoer, and every mouth speaks folly. In all this, His anger is not removed, and His hand is still raised to strike."
Isaiah,9,18,For wickedness burns like a fire that consumes thorns and briers and kindles the forest thickets so that they go up in a column of smoke.
Isaiah,9,19,"The land is scorched by the wrath of the LORD of Hosts, and the people are like fuel for the fire. No one has compassion on his brother."
Isaiah,9,20,"They carve meat on the right, but they are still hungry; they have eaten on the left, but they are still not satisfied. Each one eats the flesh of his own arm."
Isaiah,9,21,"Manasseh is with Ephraim, and Ephraim with Manasseh; together, both are against Judah. In all this, His anger is not removed, and His hand is still raised to strike."
Isaiah,10,1,Woe to those enacting crooked statutes and writing oppressive laws
Isaiah,10,2,"to keep the poor from getting a fair trial and to deprive the afflicted among my people of justice, so that widows can be their spoil and they can plunder the fatherless."
Isaiah,10,3,What will you do on the day of punishment when devastation comes from far away? Who will you run to for help? Where will you leave your wealth?
Isaiah,10,4,"There will be nothing to do except crouch among the prisoners or fall among the slain. In all this, His anger is not removed, and His hand is still raised to strike."
Isaiah,10,5,"Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger— the staff in their hands is My wrath."
Isaiah,10,6,"I will send him against a godless nation; I will command him to go against a people destined for My rage, to take spoils, to plunder, and to trample them down like clay in the streets."
Isaiah,10,7,But this is not what he intends; this is not what he plans. It is his intent to destroy and to cut off many nations.
Isaiah,10,8,"For he says, “Aren’t all my commanders kings?"
Isaiah,10,9,Isn’t Calno like Carchemish? Isn’t Hamath like Arpad? Isn’t Samaria like Damascus?
Isaiah,10,10,"As my hand seized the idolatrous kingdoms, whose idols exceeded those of Jerusalem and Samaria,"
Isaiah,10,11,and as I did to Samaria and its idols will I not also do to Jerusalem and its idols?”
Isaiah,10,12,"But when the Lord finishes all His work against Mount Zion and Jerusalem, He will say, “I will punish the king of Assyria for his arrogant acts and the proud look in his eyes.”"
Isaiah,10,13,"For he said: I have done this by my own strength and wisdom, for I am clever. I abolished the borders of nations and plundered their treasures; like a mighty warrior, I subjugated the inhabitants."
Isaiah,10,14,"My hand has reached out, as if into a nest, to seize the wealth of the nations. Like one gathering abandoned eggs, I gathered the whole earth. No wing fluttered; no beak opened or chirped."
Isaiah,10,15,Does an ax exalt itself above the one who chops with it? Does a saw magnify itself above the one who saws with it? It would be like a staff waving the one who lifts it! It would be like a rod lifting a man who isn’t wood!
Isaiah,10,16,"Therefore the Lord GOD of Hosts will inflict an emaciating disease on the well-fed of Assyria, and He will kindle a burning fire under its glory."
Isaiah,10,17,"Israel’s Light will become a fire, and its Holy One, a flame. In one day it will burn up Assyria’s thorns and thistles."
Isaiah,10,18,He will completely destroy the glory of its forests and orchards as a sickness consumes a person.
Isaiah,10,19,The remaining trees of its forest will be so few in number that a child could count them.
Isaiah,10,20,"On that day the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no longer depend on the one who struck them, but they will faithfully depend on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel."
Isaiah,10,21,"The remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the Mighty God."
Isaiah,10,22,"Israel, even if your people were as numerous as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. Destruction has been decreed; justice overflows."
Isaiah,10,23,For throughout the land the Lord GOD of Hosts is carrying out a destruction that was decreed.
Isaiah,10,24,"Therefore, the Lord GOD of Hosts says this: “My people who dwell in Zion, do not fear Assyria, though he strikes you with a rod and raises his staff over you as the Egyptians did."
Isaiah,10,25,In just a little while My wrath will be spent and My anger will turn to their destruction.”
Isaiah,10,26,And the LORD of Hosts will brandish a whip against him as He did when He struck Midian at the rock of Oreb; and He will raise His staff over the sea as He did in Egypt.
Isaiah,10,27,"On that day his burden will fall from your shoulders, and his yoke from your neck. The yoke will be broken because of fatness."
Isaiah,10,28,"Assyria has come to Aiath and has gone through Migron, storing his equipment at Michmash."
Isaiah,10,29,"They crossed over at the ford, saying, “We will spend the night at Geba.” The people of Ramah are trembling; those at Gibeah of Saul have fled."
Isaiah,10,30,"Cry aloud, daughter of Gallim! Listen, Laishah! Anathoth is miserable."
Isaiah,10,31,Madmenah has fled. The inhabitants of Gebim have sought refuge.
Isaiah,10,32,"Today he will stand at Nob, shaking his fist at the mountain of Daughter Zion, the hill of Jerusalem."
Isaiah,10,33,"Look, the Lord GOD of Hosts will chop off the branches with terrifying power, and the tall trees will be cut down, the high trees felled."
Isaiah,10,34,"He is clearing the thickets of the forest with an ax, and Lebanon with its majesty will fall."
Isaiah,11,1,"Then a shoot will grow from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots will bear fruit."
Isaiah,11,2,"The Spirit of the LORD will rest on Him— a Spirit of wisdom and understanding, a Spirit of counsel and strength, a Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD."
Isaiah,11,3,"His delight will be in the fear of the LORD. He will not judge by what He sees with His eyes, He will not execute justice by what He hears with His ears,"
Isaiah,11,4,"but He will judge the poor righteously and execute justice for the oppressed of the land. He will strike the land with discipline from His mouth, and He will kill the wicked with a command from His lips."
Isaiah,11,5,Righteousness will be a belt around His loins; faithfulness will be a belt around His waist.
Isaiah,11,6,"The wolf will live with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the goat. The calf, the young lion, and the fatling will be together, and a child will lead them."
Isaiah,11,7,"The cow and the bear will graze, their young ones will lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox."
Isaiah,11,8,"An infant will play beside the cobra’s pit, and a toddler will put his hand into a snake’s den."
Isaiah,11,9,"None will harm or destroy another on My entire holy mountain, for the land will be as full of the knowledge of the LORD as the sea is filled with water."
Isaiah,11,10,"On that day the root of Jesse will stand as a banner for the peoples. The nations will seek Him, and His resting place will be glorious."
Isaiah,11,11,"On that day the Lord will extend His hand a second time to recover—from Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and the coasts and islands of the west—the remnant of His people who survive."
Isaiah,11,12,He will lift up a banner for the nations and gather the dispersed of Israel; He will collect the scattered of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
Isaiah,11,13,"Ephraim’s envy will cease; Judah’s harassment will end. Ephraim will no longer be envious of Judah, and Judah will not harass Ephraim."
Isaiah,11,14,"But they will swoop down on the Philistine flank to the west. Together they will plunder the people of the east. They will extend their power over Edom and Moab, and the Ammonites will be their subjects."
Isaiah,11,15,"The LORD will divide the Gulf of Suez. He will wave His hand over the Euphrates with His mighty wind and will split it into seven streams, letting people walk through on foot."
Isaiah,11,16,"There will be a highway for the remnant of His people who will survive from Assyria, as there was for Israel when they came up from the land of Egypt."
Isaiah,12,1,"On that day you will say: “I will praise You, LORD, although You were angry with me. Your anger has turned away, and You have had compassion on me."
Isaiah,12,2,"Indeed, God is my salvation; I will trust Him and not be afraid, for Yah, the LORD, is my strength and my song. He has become my salvation.”"
Isaiah,12,3,"You will joyfully draw water from the springs of salvation,"
Isaiah,12,4,and on that day you will say: “Give thanks to Yahweh; proclaim His name! Celebrate His works among the peoples. Declare that His name is exalted.
Isaiah,12,5,"Sing to Yahweh, for He has done glorious things. Let this be known throughout the earth."
Isaiah,12,6,"Cry out and sing, citizen of Zion, for the Holy One of Israel is among you in His greatness.”"

Isaiah,13,5,"They are coming from a far land, from the distant horizon— the LORD and the weapons of His wrath— to destroy the whole country."
Isaiah,13,6,Wail! For the day of the LORD is near. It will come like destruction from the Almighty.
Isaiah,13,7,"Therefore everyone’s hands will become weak, and every man’s heart will melt."
Isaiah,13,8,"They will be horrified; pain and agony will seize them; they will be in anguish like a woman in labor. They will look at each other, their faces flushed with fear."
Isaiah,13,9,"Look, the day of the LORD is coming— cruel, with rage and burning anger— to make the earth a desolation and to destroy the sinners on it."

Isaiah,13,11,"I will bring disaster on the world, and their own iniquity, on the wicked. I will put an end to the pride of the arrogant and humiliate the insolence of tyrants."

Isaiah,13,19,"And Babylon, the jewel of the kingdoms, the glory of the pride of the Chaldeans, will be like Sodom and Gomorrah when God overthrew them."
Isaiah,13,20,"It will never be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation; a nomad will not pitch his tent there, and shepherds will not let their flocks rest there."
Isaiah,13,21,"But desert creatures will lie down there, and owls will fill the houses. Ostriches will dwell there, and wild goats will leap about."
Isaiah,13,22,"Hyenas will howl in the fortresses, and jackals, in the luxurious palaces. Babylon’s time is almost up; her days are almost over."
Isaiah,14,1,For the LORD will have compassion on Jacob and will choose Israel again. He will settle them on their own land. The foreigner will join them and be united with the house of Jacob.
Isaiah,14,2,The nations will escort Israel and bring it to its homeland. Then the house of Israel will possess them as male and female slaves in the LORD’s land. They will make captives of their captors and will rule over their oppressors.
Isaiah,14,3,"When the LORD gives you rest from your pain, torment, and the hard labor you were forced to do,"
Isaiah,14,4,"you will sing this song of contempt about the king of Babylon and say: How the oppressor has quieted down, and how the raging has become quiet!"

Isaiah,14,11,"Your splendor has been brought down to Sheol, along with the music of your harps. Maggots are spread out under you, and worms cover you.”"

Isaiah,14,13,"You said to yourself: “I will ascend to the heavens; I will set up my throne above the stars of God. I will sit on the mount of the gods’ assembly, in the remotest parts of the North."
Isaiah,14,14,I will ascend above the highest clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.”
Isaiah,14,15,But you will be brought down to Sheol into the deepest regions of the Pit.
Isaiah,14,16,"Those who see you will stare at you; they will look closely at you: “Is this the man who caused the earth to tremble, who shook the kingdoms,"

Isaiah,14,27,"The LORD of Hosts Himself has planned it; therefore, who can stand in its way? It is His hand that is outstretched, so who can turn it back?"
Isaiah,14,28,"In the year that King Ahaz died, this oracle came:"
Isaiah,14,29,"Don’t rejoice, all of you in Philistia, because the rod of the one who struck you is broken. For a viper will come from the root of a snake, and from its egg comes a flying serpent."
Isaiah,14,30,"Then the firstborn of the poor will be well fed, and the impoverished will lie down in safety, but I will kill your root with hunger, and your remnant will be slain."

Isaiah,15,1,"An oracle against Moab: Ar in Moab is devastated, destroyed in a night. Kir in Moab is devastated, destroyed in a night."
Isaiah,15,2,Dibon went up to its temple to weep at its high places. Moab wails on Nebo and at Medeba. Every head is shaved; every beard is cut off.
Isaiah,15,3,"In its streets they wear sackcloth; on its rooftops and in its public squares everyone wails, falling down and weeping."
Isaiah,15,4,"Heshbon and Elealeh cry out; their voices are heard as far away as Jahaz. Therefore the soldiers of Moab cry out, and they tremble."
Isaiah,15,5,"My heart cries out over Moab, whose fugitives flee as far as Zoar, to Eglath-shelishiyah; they go up the slope of Luhith weeping; they raise a cry of destruction on the road to Horonaim."
Isaiah,15,6,"The waters of Nimrim are desolate; the grass is withered, the foliage is gone, and the vegetation has vanished."

Isaiah,15,8,For their cry echoes throughout the territory of Moab. Their wailing reaches Eglaim; their wailing reaches Beer-elim.
Isaiah,15,9,"The waters of Dibon are full of blood, but I will bring on Dibon even more than this— a lion for those who escape from Moab, and for the survivors in the land."
Isaiah,16,1,"Send lambs to the ruler of the land, from Sela in the desert to the mountain of Daughter Zion."
Isaiah,16,2,"Like a bird fleeing, forced from the nest, the daughters of Moab will be at the fords of the Arnon."

Isaiah,16,7,"Therefore let Moab wail; let every one of them wail for Moab. Mourn, you who are completely devastated, for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth."
Isaiah,16,8,For Heshbon’s terraced vineyards and the grapevines of Sibmah have withered. The rulers of the nations have trampled its choice vines that reached as far as Jazer and spread to the desert. Their shoots spread out and reached the Dead Sea.
Isaiah,16,9,So I join with Jazer to weep for the vines of Sibmah; I drench Heshbon and Elealeh with my tears. Triumphant shouts have fallen silent over your summer fruit and your harvest.
Isaiah,16,10,Joy and rejoicing have been removed from the orchard; no one is singing or shouting for joy in the vineyards. No one tramples grapes in the winepresses. I have put an end to the shouting.
Isaiah,16,11,"Therefore I moan like the sound of a lyre for Moab, as does my innermost being for Kir-heres."
Isaiah,16,12,"When Moab appears on the high place, when he tires himself out and comes to his sanctuary to pray, it will do him no good."
Isaiah,16,13,This is the message that the LORD previously announced about Moab.

Isaiah,17,4,"On that day the splendor of Jacob will fade, and his healthy body will become emaciated."
Isaiah,17,5,It will be as if a reaper had gathered standing grain— his arm harvesting the heads of grain— and as if one had gleaned heads of grain in the Valley of Rephaim.
Isaiah,17,6,"Only gleanings will be left in Israel, as if an olive tree had been beaten— two or three berries at the very top of the tree, four or five on its fruitful branches. This is the declaration of the LORD, the God of Israel."
Isaiah,17,7,On that day people will look to their Maker and will turn their eyes to the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah,17,8,They will not look to the altars they made with their hands or to the Asherahs and incense altars they made with their fingers.
Isaiah,17,9,On that day their strong cities will be like the abandoned woods and mountaintops that were abandoned because of the Israelites; there will be desolation.

Isaiah,20,3,"the LORD said, “As My servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot three years as a sign and omen against Egypt and Cush,"
Isaiah,20,4,"so the king of Assyria will lead the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, young and old alike, naked and barefoot, with bared buttocks—to Egypt’s shame."

Isaiah,24,10,The city of chaos is shattered; every house is closed to entry.

Isaiah,25,12,"The high-walled fortress will be brought down, thrown to the ground, to the dust."
Isaiah,26,1,On that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: We have a strong city. Salvation is established as walls and ramparts.
Isaiah,26,2,Open the gates so a righteous nation can come in— one that remains faithful.
Isaiah,26,3,"You will keep the mind that is dependent on You in perfect peace, for it is trusting in You."
Isaiah,26,4,"Trust in the LORD forever, because in Yah, the LORD, is an everlasting rock!"

Isaiah,26,17,"As a pregnant woman about to give birth writhes and cries out in her pains, so we were before You, LORD."

Isaiah,27,10,"For the fortified city will be deserted, pastures abandoned and forsaken like a wilderness. Calves will graze there, and there they will spread out and strip its branches."
Isaiah,27,11,"When its branches dry out, they will be broken off. Women will come and make fires with them, for they are not a people with understanding. Therefore their Maker will not have compassion on them, and their Creator will not be gracious to them."
Isaiah,27,12,"On that day the LORD will thresh grain from the Euphrates River as far as the Wadi of Egypt, and you Israelites will be gathered one by one."

Isaiah,28,6,"a spirit of justice to the one who sits in judgment, and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate."

Isaiah,28,9,Who is he trying to teach? Who is he trying to instruct? Infants just weaned from milk? Babies removed from the breast?

Isaiah,28,11,So He will speak to this people with stammering speech and in a foreign language.
Isaiah,28,12,"He had said to them: “This is the place of rest, let the weary rest; this is the place of repose.” But they would not listen."
Isaiah,28,13,"Then the word of the LORD came to them: “Law after law, law after law, line after line, line after line, a little here, a little there,” so they go stumbling backward, to be broken, trapped, and captured."
Isaiah,28,14,"Therefore hear the word of the LORD, you mockers who rule this people in Jerusalem."
Isaiah,28,15,"For you said, “We have cut a deal with Death, and we have made an agreement with Sheol; when the overwhelming scourge passes through, it will not touch us, because we have made falsehood our refuge and have hidden behind treachery.”"

Isaiah,28,18,"Your deal with Death will be dissolved, and your agreement with Sheol will not last. When the overwhelming scourge passes through, you will be trampled."
Isaiah,28,19,"Every time it passes through, it will carry you away; it will pass through every morning— every day and every night. Only terror will cause you to understand the message."
Isaiah,28,20,"Indeed, the bed is too short to stretch out on, and its cover too small to wrap up in."
Isaiah,28,21,"For the LORD will rise up as He did at Mount Perazim. He will rise in wrath, as at the Valley of Gibeon, to do His work, His strange work, and to perform His task, His disturbing task."

Isaiah,28,23,Listen and hear my voice. Pay attention and hear what I say.
Isaiah,28,24,Does the plowman plow every day to plant seed? Does he continuously break up and cultivate the soil?
Isaiah,28,25,"When he has leveled its surface, does he not then scatter black cumin and sow cumin? He plants wheat in rows and barley in plots, with spelt as their border."
Isaiah,28,26,His God teaches him order; He instructs him.
Isaiah,28,27,"Certainly black cumin is not threshed with a threshing board, and a cart wheel is not rolled over the cumin. But black cumin is beaten out with a stick, and cumin with a rod."
Isaiah,28,28,"Bread grain is crushed, but is not threshed endlessly. Though the wheel of the farmer’s cart rumbles, his horses do not crush it."

Isaiah,29,4,"You will be brought down; you will speak from the ground, and your words will come from low in the dust. Your voice will be like that of a spirit from the ground; your speech will whisper from the dust."
Isaiah,29,5,"Your many foes will be like fine dust, and many of the ruthless, like blowing chaff. Then suddenly, in an instant,"
Isaiah,29,6,"you will be visited by the LORD of Hosts with thunder, earthquake, and loud noise, storm, tempest, and a flame of consuming fire."
Isaiah,29,7,"All the many nations going out to battle against Ariel— all the attackers, the siege works against her, and those who oppress her— will then be like a dream, a vision in the night."
Isaiah,29,8,"It will be like a hungry one who dreams he is eating, then wakes and is still hungry; and like a thirsty one who dreams he is drinking, then wakes and is still thirsty, longing for water. So it will be for all the many nations who go to battle against Mount Zion."
Isaiah,29,9,"Stop and be astonished; blind yourselves and be blind! They are drunk, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with beer."
Isaiah,29,10,"For the LORD has poured out on you an overwhelming urge to sleep; He has shut your eyes—the prophets, and covered your heads—the seers."
Isaiah,29,11,"For you the entire vision will be like the words of a sealed document. If it is given to one who can read and he is asked to read it, he will say, “I can’t read it, because it is sealed.”"
Isaiah,29,12,"And if the document is given to one who cannot read and he is asked to read it, he will say, “I can’t read.”"
Isaiah,29,13,"The Lord said: Because these people approach Me with their mouths to honor Me with lip-service— yet their hearts are far from Me, and their worship consists of man-made rules learned by rote—"
Isaiah,29,14,"therefore I will again confound these people with wonder after wonder. The wisdom of their wise men will vanish, and the understanding of the perceptive will be hidden."
Isaiah,29,15,"Woe to those who go to great lengths to hide their plans from the LORD. They do their works in darkness, and say, “Who sees us? Who knows us?”"
Isaiah,29,16,"You have turned things around, as if the potter were the same as the clay. How can what is made say about its maker, “He didn’t make me”? How can what is formed say about the one who formed it, “He doesn’t understand what he’s doing”?"
Isaiah,29,17,"Isn’t it true that in just a little while Lebanon will become an orchard, and the orchard will seem like a forest?"

Isaiah,29,21,"those who, with their speech, accuse a person of wrongdoing, who set a trap at the gate for the mediator, and without cause deprive the righteous of justice."
Isaiah,29,22,"Therefore, the LORD who redeemed Abraham says this about the house of Jacob: Jacob will no longer be ashamed and his face will no longer be pale."
Isaiah,29,23,"For when he sees his children, the work of My hands within his nation, they will honor My name, they will honor the Holy One of Jacob and stand in awe of the God of Israel."
Isaiah,29,24,"Those who are confused will gain understanding, and those who grumble will accept instruction."
Isaiah,30,1,"Woe to the rebellious children! This is the LORD’s declaration. They carry out a plan, but not Mine; they make an alliance, but against My will, piling sin on top of sin."
Isaiah,30,2,"They set out to go down to Egypt without asking My advice, in order to seek shelter under Pharaoh’s protection and take refuge in Egypt’s shadow."
Isaiah,30,3,"But Pharaoh’s protection will become your shame, and refuge in Egypt’s shadow your disgrace."
Isaiah,30,4,"For though his princes are at Zoan and his messengers reach as far as Hanes,"
Isaiah,30,5,"everyone will be ashamed because of a people who can’t help. They are of no benefit, they are no help; they are good for nothing but shame and reproach."
Isaiah,30,6,"An oracle about the animals of the Negev: Through a land of trouble and distress, of lioness and lion, of viper and flying serpent, they carry their wealth on the backs of donkeys and their treasures on the humps of camels, to a people who will not help them."

Isaiah,30,11,Get out of the way! Leave the pathway. Rid us of the Holy One of Israel.”
Isaiah,30,12,"Therefore the Holy One of Israel says: “Because you have rejected this message and have trusted in oppression and deceit, and have depended on them,"
Isaiah,30,13,"this iniquity of yours will be like a spreading breach, a bulge in a high wall whose collapse will come in an instant—suddenly!"
Isaiah,30,14,"Its collapse will be like the shattering of a potter’s jar, crushed to pieces, so that not even a fragment of pottery will be found among its shattered remains— no fragment large enough to take fire from a hearth or scoop water from a cistern.”"
Isaiah,30,15,"For the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, has said: “You will be delivered by returning and resting; your strength will lie in quiet confidence. But you are not willing.”"
Isaiah,30,16,"You say, “No! We will escape on horses”— therefore you will escape!— and, “We will ride on fast horses”— but those who pursue you will be faster."
Isaiah,30,17,"One thousand will flee at the threat of one, at the threat of five you will flee, until you alone remain like a solitary pole on a mountaintop or a banner on a hill."

Isaiah,30,21,"and whenever you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear this command behind you: “This is the way. Walk in it.”"
Isaiah,30,22,"Then you will defile your silver-plated idols and your gold-plated images. You will throw them away like menstrual cloths, and call them filth."
Isaiah,30,23,"Then He will send rain for your seed that you have sown in the ground, and the food, the produce of the ground, will be rich and plentiful. On that day your cattle will graze in open pastures."
Isaiah,30,24,The oxen and donkeys that work the ground will eat salted fodder scattered with winnowing shovel and fork.
Isaiah,30,25,Streams flowing with water will be on every high mountain and every raised hill on the day of great slaughter when the towers fall.
Isaiah,30,26,"The moonlight will be as bright as the sunlight, and the sunlight will be seven times brighter—like the light of seven days—on the day that the LORD bandages His people’s injuries and heals the wounds He inflicted."
Isaiah,30,27,"Look, Yahweh comes from far away, His anger burning and heavy with smoke. His lips are full of fury, and His tongue is like a consuming fire."
Isaiah,30,28,His breath is like an overflowing torrent that rises to the neck. He comes to sift the nations in a sieve of destruction and to put a bridle on the jaws of the peoples to lead them astray.
Isaiah,30,29,"Your singing will be like that on the night of a holy festival, and your heart will rejoice like one who walks to the music of a flute, going up to the mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel."
Isaiah,30,30,"And the LORD will make the splendor of His voice heard and reveal His arm striking in angry wrath and a flame of consuming fire, in driving rain, a torrent, and hailstones."
Isaiah,30,31,Assyria will be shattered by the voice of the LORD. He will strike with a rod.
Isaiah,30,32,And every stroke of the appointed staff that the LORD brings down on him will be to the sound of tambourines and lyres; He will fight against him with brandished weapons.
Isaiah,30,33,"Indeed! Topheth has been ready for the king for a long time now. Its funeral pyre is deep and wide, with plenty of fire and wood. The breath of the LORD, like a torrent of brimstone, kindles it."
Isaiah,31,1,Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help and who depend on horses! They trust in the abundance of chariots and in the large number of horsemen. They do not look to the Holy One of Israel and they do not seek the LORD’s help.
Isaiah,31,2,But He also is wise and brings disaster. He does not go back on what He says; He will rise up against the house of wicked men and against the allies of evildoers.
Isaiah,31,3,"Egyptians are men, not God; their horses are flesh, not spirit. When the LORD raises His hand to strike, the helper will stumble and the one who is helped will fall; both will perish together."
Isaiah,31,4,"For this is what the LORD said to me: As a lion or young lion growls over its prey when a band of shepherds is called out against it, and is not terrified by their shouting or subdued by their noise, so the LORD of Hosts will come down to fight on Mount Zion and on its hill."
Isaiah,31,5,"Like hovering birds, so the LORD of Hosts will protect Jerusalem— by protecting it, He will rescue it, by sparing it, He will deliver it."

Isaiah,32,4,"The reckless mind will gain knowledge, and the stammering tongue will speak clearly and fluently."
Isaiah,32,5,"A fool will no longer be called a noble, nor a scoundrel said to be important."
Isaiah,32,6,For a fool speaks foolishness and his mind plots iniquity. He lives in a godless way and speaks falsely about the LORD. He leaves the hungry empty and deprives the thirsty of drink.
Isaiah,32,7,"The scoundrel’s weapons are destructive; he hatches plots to destroy the needy with lies, even when the poor says what is right."
Isaiah,32,8,But a noble person plans noble things; he stands up for noble causes.
Isaiah,32,9,"Stand up, you complacent women; listen to me. Pay attention to what I say, you overconfident daughters."
Isaiah,32,10,"In a little more than a year you overconfident ones will shudder, for the vintage will fail and the harvest will not come."
Isaiah,32,11,"Shudder, you complacent ones; tremble, you overconfident ones! Strip yourselves bare and put sackcloth around your waists."
Isaiah,32,12,"Beat your breasts in mourning for the delightful fields and the fruitful vines,"
Isaiah,32,13,"for the ground of my people growing thorns and briers, indeed, for every joyous house in the joyful city."
Isaiah,32,14,"For the palace will be forsaken, the busy city abandoned. The hill and the watchtower will become barren places forever, the joy of wild donkeys, and a pasture for flocks,"
Isaiah,32,15,"until the Spirit from heaven is poured out on us. Then the desert will become an orchard, and the orchard will seem like a forest."
Isaiah,32,16,"Then justice will inhabit the wilderness, and righteousness will dwell in the orchard."
Isaiah,32,17,The result of righteousness will be peace; the effect of righteousness will be quiet confidence forever.
Isaiah,32,18,"Then my people will dwell in a peaceful place, in safe and secure dwellings."
Isaiah,32,19,"But hail will level the forest, and the city will sink into the depths."
Isaiah,32,20,Those who sow seed are happy beside abundant waters; they let ox and donkey range freely.

Isaiah,33,7,Listen! Their warriors cry loudly in the streets; the messengers of peace weep bitterly.
Isaiah,33,8,"The highways are deserted; travel has ceased. An agreement has been broken, cities despised, and human life disregarded."
Isaiah,33,9,The land mourns and withers; Lebanon is ashamed and decayed. Sharon is like a desert; Bashan and Carmel shake off their leaves.
Isaiah,33,10,"“Now I will rise up,” says the LORD. “Now I will lift Myself up. Now I will be exalted."
Isaiah,33,11,You will conceive chaff; you will give birth to stubble. Your breath is fire that will consume you.
Isaiah,33,12,"The peoples will be burned to ashes, like thorns cut down and burned in a fire."
Isaiah,33,13,"You who are far off, hear what I have done; you who are near, know My strength.”"
Isaiah,33,14,The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling seizes the ungodly: “Who among us can dwell with a consuming fire? Who among us can dwell with ever-burning flames?”
Isaiah,33,15,"The one who lives righteously and speaks rightly, who refuses gain from extortion, whose hand never takes a bribe, who stops his ears from listening to murderous plots and shuts his eyes to avoid endorsing evil—"
Isaiah,33,16,"he will dwell on the heights; his refuge will be the rocky fortresses, his food provided, his water assured."
Isaiah,33,17,Your eyes will see the King in His beauty; you will see a vast land.
Isaiah,33,18,Your mind will meditate on the past terror: “Where is the accountant? Where is the tribute collector? Where is the one who spied out our defenses?”
Isaiah,33,19,"You will no longer see the barbarians, a people whose speech is difficult to comprehend— who stammer in a language that is not understood."
Isaiah,33,20,"Look at Zion, the city of our festival times. Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a peaceful pasture, a tent that does not wander; its tent pegs will not be pulled up nor will any of its cords be loosened."
Isaiah,33,21,"For the majestic One, our LORD, will be there, a place of rivers and broad streams where ships that are rowed will not go, and majestic vessels will not pass."
Isaiah,33,22,"For the LORD is our Judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our King. He will save us."
Isaiah,33,23,"Your ropes are slack; they cannot hold the base of the mast or spread out the flag. Then abundant spoil will be divided, the lame will plunder it,"
Isaiah,33,24,"and none there will say, “I am sick.” The people who dwell there will be forgiven their iniquity."
Isaiah,34,1,"You nations, come here and listen; you peoples, pay attention! Let the earth hear, and all that fills it, the world and all that comes from it."
Isaiah,34,2,"The LORD is angry with all the nations— furious with all their armies. He will set them apart for destruction, giving them over to slaughter."
Isaiah,34,3,"Their slain will be thrown out, and the stench of their corpses will rise; the mountains will flow with their blood."
Isaiah,34,4,"All the heavenly bodies will dissolve. The skies will roll up like a scroll, and their stars will all wither as leaves wither on the vine, and foliage on the fig tree."
Isaiah,34,5,"When My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens, it will then come down on Edom and on the people I have set apart for destruction."
Isaiah,34,6,"The LORD’s sword is covered with blood. It drips with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams. For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah, a great slaughter in the land of Edom."
Isaiah,34,7,"The wild oxen will be struck down with them, and young bulls with the mighty bulls. Their land will be soaked with blood, and their soil will be saturated with fat."
Isaiah,34,8,"For the LORD has a day of vengeance, a time of paying back Edom for its hostility against Zion."
Isaiah,34,9,"Edom’s streams will be turned into pitch, her soil into sulfur; her land will become burning pitch."

Isaiah,34,12,"No nobles will be left to proclaim a king, and all her princes will come to nothing."
Isaiah,34,13,"Her palaces will be overgrown with thorns; her fortified cities, with thistles and briers. She will become a dwelling for jackals, an abode for ostriches."
Isaiah,34,14,"The desert creatures will meet hyenas, and one wild goat will call to another. Indeed, the screech owl will stay there and will find a resting place for herself."
Isaiah,34,15,"The sand partridge will make her nest there; she will lay and hatch her eggs and will gather her brood under her shadow. Indeed, the birds of prey will gather there, each with its mate."
Isaiah,34,16,"Search and read the scroll of the LORD: Not one of them will be missing, none will be lacking its mate, because He has ordered it by my mouth, and He will gather them by His Spirit."
Isaiah,34,17,He has ordained a lot for them; His hand allotted their portion with a measuring line. They will possess it forever; they will dwell in it from generation to generation.
Isaiah,35,1,The wilderness and the dry land will be glad; the desert will rejoice and blossom like a rose.
Isaiah,35,2,"It will blossom abundantly and will also rejoice with joy and singing. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon. They will see the glory of the LORD, the splendor of our God."
Isaiah,35,3,"Strengthen the weak hands, steady the shaking knees!"
Isaiah,35,4,Say to the cowardly: “Be strong; do not fear! Here is your God; vengeance is coming. God’s retribution is coming; He will save you.”
Isaiah,35,5,"Then the eyes of the blind will be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped."
Isaiah,35,6,"Then the lame will leap like a deer, and the tongue of the mute will sing for joy, for water will gush in the wilderness, and streams in the desert;"
Isaiah,35,7,"the parched ground will become a pool of water, and the thirsty land springs of water. In the haunt of jackals, in their lairs, there will be grass, reeds, and papyrus."
Isaiah,35,8,"A road will be there and a way; it will be called the Holy Way. The unclean will not travel on it, but it will be for the one who walks the path. Even the fool will not go astray."
Isaiah,35,9,"There will be no lion there, and no vicious beast will go up on it; they will not be found there. But the redeemed will walk on it,"
Isaiah,35,10,"and the redeemed of the LORD will return and come to Zion with singing, crowned with unending joy. Joy and gladness will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee."
Isaiah,36,1,"In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them."
Isaiah,36,2,"Then the king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh, along with a massive army, from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. The Assyrian stood near the conduit of the upper pool, by the road to the Fuller’s Field."
Isaiah,36,3,"Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the court secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the court historian, came out to him."
Isaiah,36,4,"The Rabshakeh said to them, “Tell Hezekiah: The great king, the king of Assyria, says this: What are you relying on?"
Isaiah,36,5,I say that your strategy and military preparedness are mere words. What are you now relying on that you have rebelled against me?
Isaiah,36,6,"Look, you are trusting in Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff that will enter and pierce the hand of anyone who leans on it. This is how Pharaoh king of Egypt is to all who trust in him."
Isaiah,36,7,"Suppose you say to me, ‘We trust in the LORD our God.’ Isn’t He the One whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You are to worship at this altar’?"
Isaiah,36,8,"Now make a deal with my master, the king of Assyria. I’ll give you 2,000 horses if you’re able to supply riders for them!"
Isaiah,36,9,How then can you drive back a single officer among the weakest of my master’s officers and trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen?
Isaiah,36,10,"Have I attacked this land to destroy it without the LORD’s approval? The LORD said to me, ‘Attack this land and destroy it.’”"
Isaiah,36,11,"Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don’t speak to us in Hebrew within earshot of the people who are on the wall.”"
Isaiah,36,12,"But the Rabshakeh replied, “Has my master sent me to speak these words to your master and to you, and not to the men who are sitting on the wall, who are destined with you to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine?”"
Isaiah,36,13,"Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out loudly in Hebrew: Listen to the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!"
Isaiah,36,14,"This is what the king says: “Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you, for he cannot deliver you."
Isaiah,36,15,"Don’t let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the LORD, saying, ‘The LORD will certainly deliver us! This city will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.’”"
Isaiah,36,16,"Don’t listen to Hezekiah, for this is what the king of Assyria says: “Make peace with me and surrender to me. Then every one of you may eat from his own vine and his own fig tree and drink water from his own cistern"
Isaiah,36,17,"until I come and take you away to a land like your own land—a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards."
Isaiah,36,18,"Beware that Hezekiah does not mislead you by saying, ‘The LORD will deliver us.’ Has any one of the gods of the nations delivered his land from the power of the king of Assyria?"
Isaiah,36,19,Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria from my power?
Isaiah,36,20,Who among all the gods of these lands ever delivered his land from my power? So will the LORD deliver Jerusalem.”
Isaiah,36,21,"But they kept silent; they didn’t say anything, for the king’s command was, “Don’t answer him.”"
Isaiah,36,22,"Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the court secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the court historian, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and reported to him the words of the Rabshakeh."
Isaiah,37,1,"When King Hezekiah heard their report, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and went to the LORD’s temple."
Isaiah,37,2,"Then he sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the court secretary, and the leading priests, who were wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz."
Isaiah,37,3,"They said to him, “This is what Hezekiah says: ‘Today is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace, for children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to deliver them."
Isaiah,37,4,"Perhaps Yahweh your God will hear all the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria sent to mock the living God, and will rebuke him for the words that Yahweh your God has heard. Therefore offer a prayer for the surviving remnant.’”"
Isaiah,37,5,"So the servants of King Hezekiah went to Isaiah,"
Isaiah,37,6,"who said to them, “Tell your master this, ‘The LORD says: Don’t be afraid because of the words you have heard, which the king of Assyria’s attendants have blasphemed Me with."
Isaiah,37,7,"I am about to put a spirit in him and he will hear a rumor and return to his own land, where I will cause him to fall by the sword.’”"
Isaiah,37,8,"When the Rabshakeh heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he returned and found him fighting against Libnah."
Isaiah,37,9,"The king had heard this about Tirhakah king of Cush: “He has set out to fight against you.” So when he heard this, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,"
Isaiah,37,10,"“Say this to Hezekiah king of Judah: ‘Don’t let your God, whom you trust, deceive you by promising that Jerusalem won’t be handed over to the king of Assyria."
Isaiah,37,11,"Look, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries: they completely destroyed them. Will you be rescued?"
Isaiah,37,12,"Did the gods of the nations that my predecessors destroyed rescue them—Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the Edenites in Telassar?"
Isaiah,37,13,"Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, or Ivvah?’”"
Isaiah,37,14,"Hezekiah took the letter from the messengers, read it, then went up to the LORD’s temple and spread it out before the LORD."
Isaiah,37,15,Then Hezekiah prayed to the LORD:
Isaiah,37,16,"LORD of Hosts, God of Israel, who is enthroned above the cherubim, You are God—You alone—of all the kingdoms of the earth. You made the heavens and the earth."
Isaiah,37,17,"Listen closely, LORD, and hear; open Your eyes, LORD, and see. Hear all the words that Sennacherib has sent to mock the living God."
Isaiah,37,18,"LORD, it is true that the kings of Assyria have devastated all these countries and their lands."
Isaiah,37,19,"They have thrown their gods into the fire, for they were not gods but made by human hands—wood and stone. So they have destroyed them."
Isaiah,37,20,"Now, LORD our God, save us from his power so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You are the LORD—You alone."
Isaiah,37,21,"Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah: “The LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Because you prayed to Me about Sennacherib king of Assyria,"
Isaiah,37,22,this is the word the LORD has spoken against him: Virgin Daughter Zion despises you and scorns you: Daughter Jerusalem shakes her head behind your back.
Isaiah,37,23,Who is it you have mocked and blasphemed? Who have you raised your voice against and lifted your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel!
Isaiah,37,24,"You have mocked the LORD through your servants. You have said, “With my many chariots I have gone up to the heights of the mountains, to the far recesses of Lebanon. I cut down its tallest cedars, its choice cypress trees. I came to its distant heights, its densest forest."
Isaiah,37,25,I dug wells and drank water. I dried up all the streams of Egypt with the soles of my feet.”
Isaiah,37,26,"Have you not heard? I designed it long ago; I planned it in days gone by. I have now brought it to pass, and you have crushed fortified cities into piles of rubble."
Isaiah,37,27,"Their inhabitants have become powerless, dismayed, and ashamed. They are plants of the field, tender grass, grass on the rooftops, blasted by the east wind."
Isaiah,37,28,"But I know your sitting down, your going out and your coming in, and your raging against Me."
Isaiah,37,29,"Because your raging against Me and your arrogance have reached My ears, I will put My hook in your nose and My bit in your mouth; I will make you go back the way you came."
Isaiah,37,30,"“‘This will be the sign for you: This year you will eat what grows on its own, and in the second year what grows from that. But in the third year sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit."
Isaiah,37,31,The surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root downward and bear fruit upward.
Isaiah,37,32,"For a remnant will go out from Jerusalem and survivors, from Mount Zion. The zeal of the LORD of Hosts will accomplish this.’"
Isaiah,37,33,"“Therefore, this is what the LORD says about the king of Assyria: He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow there or come before it with a shield or build up an assault ramp against it."
Isaiah,37,34,"He will go back the way he came, and he will not enter this city. This is the LORD’s declaration."
Isaiah,37,35,I will defend this city and rescue it because of Me and because of My servant David.”
Isaiah,37,36,"Then the angel of the LORD went out and struck down 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians. When the people got up the next morning—there were all the dead bodies!"
Isaiah,37,37,So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and left. He returned home and lived in Nineveh.
Isaiah,37,38,"One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword and escaped to the land of Ararat. Then his son Esar-haddon became king in his place."
Isaiah,38,1,"In those days Hezekiah became terminally ill. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came and said to him, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Put your affairs in order, for you are about to die; you will not recover.’”"
Isaiah,38,2,Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD.
Isaiah,38,3,"He said, “Please, LORD, remember how I have walked before You faithfully and wholeheartedly, and have done what pleases You.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly."
Isaiah,38,4,Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah:
Isaiah,38,5,"“Go and tell Hezekiah that this is what the LORD God of your ancestor David says: I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Look, I am going to add 15 years to your life."
Isaiah,38,6,And I will deliver you and this city from the power of the king of Assyria; I will defend this city.
Isaiah,38,7,This is the sign to you from the LORD that He will do what He has promised:
Isaiah,38,8,I am going to make the sun’s shadow that goes down on Ahaz’s stairway go back by 10 steps.” So the sun’s shadow went back the 10 steps it had descended.
Isaiah,38,9,A poem by Hezekiah king of Judah after he had been sick and had recovered from his illness:
Isaiah,38,10,I said: In the prime of my life I must go to the gates of Sheol; I am deprived of the rest of my years.
Isaiah,38,11,"I said: I will never see the LORD, the LORD in the land of the living; I will not look on humanity any longer with the inhabitants of what is passing away."
Isaiah,38,12,My dwelling is plucked up and removed from me like a shepherd’s tent. I have rolled up my life like a weaver; He cuts me off from the loom. You make an end of me from day until night.
Isaiah,38,13,I thought until the morning: He will break all my bones like a lion; You make an end of me day and night.
Isaiah,38,14,"I chirp like a swallow or a crane; I moan like a dove. My eyes grow weak looking upward. Lord, I am oppressed; support me."
Isaiah,38,15,"What can I say? He has spoken to me, and He Himself has done it. I walk along slowly all my years because of the bitterness of my soul,"
Isaiah,38,16,"Lord, because of these promises people live, and in all of them is the life of my spirit as well; You have restored me to health and let me live."
Isaiah,38,17,"Indeed, it was for my own welfare that I had such great bitterness; but Your love has delivered me from the Pit of destruction, for You have thrown all my sins behind Your back."
Isaiah,38,18,For Sheol cannot thank You; Death cannot praise You. Those who go down to the Pit cannot hope for Your faithfulness.
Isaiah,38,19,"The living, only the living can thank You, as I do today; a father will make Your faithfulness known to children."
Isaiah,38,20,The LORD will save me; we will play stringed instruments all the days of our lives at the house of the LORD.

Isaiah,38,22,"And Hezekiah had asked, “What is the sign that I will go up to the LORD’s temple?”"
Isaiah,39,1,"At that time Merodach-baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah since he heard that he had been sick and had recovered."
Isaiah,39,2,"Hezekiah was pleased with them, and showed them his treasure house—the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil—and all his armory, and everything that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his palace and in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them."
Isaiah,39,3,"Then the prophet Isaiah came to King Hezekiah and asked him, “Where did these men come from and what did they say to you?” Hezekiah replied, “They came to me from a distant country, from Babylon.”"
Isaiah,39,4,"Isaiah asked, “What have they seen in your palace?” Hezekiah answered, “They have seen everything in my palace. There isn’t anything in my treasuries that I didn’t show them.”"
Isaiah,39,5,"Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the LORD of Hosts:"
Isaiah,39,6,"‘The time will certainly come when everything in your palace and all that your fathers have stored up until this day will be carried off to Babylon; nothing will be left,’ says the LORD."
Isaiah,39,7,"‘Some of your descendants who come from you will be taken away, and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’”"

Isaiah,40,5,"And the glory of the LORD will appear, and all humanity together will see it, for the mouth of the LORD has spoken."
Isaiah,40,6,"A voice was saying, “Cry out!” Another said, “What should I cry out?” “All humanity is grass, and all its goodness is like the flower of the field."
Isaiah,40,7,"The grass withers, the flowers fade when the breath of the LORD blows on them; indeed, the people are grass."
Isaiah,40,8,"The grass withers, the flowers fade, but the word of our God remains forever.”"

Isaiah,40,30,"Youths may faint and grow weary, and young men stumble and fall,"

Jeremiah,1,15,"Indeed, I am about to summon all the clans and kingdoms of the north.” This is the LORD’s declaration. They will come, and each king will set up his throne at the entrance to Jerusalem’s gates. They will attack all her surrounding walls and all the other cities of Judah."
Jeremiah,1,16,“I will pronounce My judgments against them for all the evil they did when they abandoned Me to burn incense to other gods and to worship the works of their own hands.
Jeremiah,1,17,"“Now, get ready. Stand up and tell them everything that I command you. Do not be intimidated by them or I will cause you to cower before them."
Jeremiah,1,18,"Today, I am the One who has made you a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land—against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the population."
Jeremiah,1,19,"They will fight against you but never prevail over you, since I am with you to rescue you.” This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,2,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Jeremiah,2,2,"“Go and announce directly to Jerusalem that this is what the LORD says: I remember the loyalty of your youth, your love as a bride— how you followed Me in the wilderness, in a land not sown."
Jeremiah,2,3,"Israel was holy to the LORD, the firstfruits of His harvest. All who ate of it found themselves guilty; disaster came on them.” This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,2,4,"Hear the word of the LORD, house of Jacob and all families of the house of Israel."
Jeremiah,2,5,"This is what the LORD says: What fault did your fathers find in Me that they went so far from Me, followed worthless idols, and became worthless themselves?"
Jeremiah,2,6,"They stopped asking, “Where is the LORD who brought us from the land of Egypt, who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and ravines, through a land of drought and darkness, a land no one traveled through and where no one lived?”"
Jeremiah,2,7,"I brought you to a fertile land to eat its fruit and bounty, but after you entered, you defiled My land; you made My inheritance detestable."
Jeremiah,2,8,"The priests quit asking, “Where is the LORD?” The experts in the law no longer knew Me, and the rulers rebelled against Me. The prophets prophesied by Baal and followed useless idols."
Jeremiah,2,9,"Therefore, I will bring a case against you again. This is the LORD’s declaration. I will bring a case against your children’s children."
Jeremiah,2,10,Cross over to Cyprus and take a look. Send someone to Kedar and consider carefully; see if there has ever been anything like this:
Jeremiah,2,11,Has a nation ever exchanged its gods? (But they were not gods!) Yet My people have exchanged their Glory for useless idols.
Jeremiah,2,12,"Be horrified at this, heavens; be shocked and utterly appalled. This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,2,13,"For My people have committed a double evil: They have abandoned Me, the fountain of living water, and dug cisterns for themselves, cracked cisterns that cannot hold water."
Jeremiah,2,14,Is Israel a slave? Was he born into slavery? Why else has he become a prey?
Jeremiah,2,15,"The young lions have roared at him; they have roared loudly. They have laid waste his land. His cities are in ruins, without inhabitants."
Jeremiah,2,16,The men of Memphis and Tahpanhes have also broken your skull.
Jeremiah,2,17,Have you not brought this on yourself by abandoning the LORD your God while He was leading you along the way?
Jeremiah,2,18,Now what will you gain by traveling along the way to Egypt to drink the waters of the Nile? What will you gain by traveling along the way to Assyria to drink the waters of the Euphrates?
Jeremiah,2,19,Your own evil will discipline you; your own apostasies will reprimand you. Think it over and see how evil and bitter it is for you to abandon the LORD your God and to have no fear of Me. This is the declaration of the Lord GOD of Hosts.
Jeremiah,2,20,"For long ago I broke your yoke; I tore off your chains. You insisted, “I will not serve!” On every high hill and under every green tree you lie down like a prostitute."
Jeremiah,2,21,"I planted you, a choice vine from the very best seed. How then could you turn into a degenerate, foreign vine?"
Jeremiah,2,22,"Even if you wash with lye and use a great amount of soap, the stain of your sin is still in front of Me. This is the Lord GOD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,2,23,"How can you protest, “I am not defiled; I have not followed the Baals”? Look at your behavior in the valley; acknowledge what you have done. You are a swift young camel twisting and turning on her way,"
Jeremiah,2,24,a wild donkey at home in the wilderness. She sniffs the wind in the heat of her desire. Who can control her passion? All who look for her will not become tired; they will find her in her mating season.
Jeremiah,2,25,"Keep your feet from going bare and your throat from thirst. But you say, “It’s hopeless; I love strangers, and I will continue to follow them.”"
Jeremiah,2,26,"Like the shame of a thief when he is caught, so the house of Israel has been put to shame. They, their kings, their officials, their priests, and their prophets"
Jeremiah,2,27,"say to a tree, “You are my father,” and to a stone, “You gave birth to me.” For they have turned their back to Me and not their face, yet in their time of disaster they beg, “Rise up and save us!”"
Jeremiah,2,28,"But where are your gods you made for yourself? Let them rise up and save you in your time of disaster if they can, for your gods are as numerous as your cities, Judah."
Jeremiah,2,29,Why do you bring a case against Me? All of you have rebelled against Me. This is the LORD’s declaration.
Jeremiah,2,30,I have struck down your children in vain; they would not accept discipline. Your own sword has devoured your prophets like a ravaging lion.
Jeremiah,2,31,"Evil generation, pay attention to the word of the LORD! Have I been a wilderness to Israel or a land of dense darkness? Why do My people claim, “We will go where we want; we will no longer come to You”?"
Jeremiah,2,32,Can a young woman forget her jewelry or a bride her wedding sash? Yet My people have forgotten Me for countless days.
Jeremiah,2,33,How skillfully you pursue love; you also teach evil women your ways.
Jeremiah,2,34,"Moreover, your skirts are stained with the blood of the innocent poor. You did not catch them breaking and entering. But in spite of all these things"
Jeremiah,2,35,"you claim, “I am innocent. His anger is sure to turn away from me.” But I will certainly judge you because you have said, “I have not sinned.”"
Jeremiah,2,36,"How unstable you are, constantly changing your ways! You will be put to shame by Egypt just as you were put to shame by Assyria."
Jeremiah,2,37,"Moreover, you will be led out from here with your hands on your head since the LORD has rejected those you trust; you will not succeed even with their help."
Jeremiah,3,1,"If a man divorces his wife and she leaves him to marry another, can he ever return to her? Wouldn’t such a land become totally defiled? But you! You have played the prostitute with many partners— can you return to Me? This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,3,2,Look to the barren heights and see. Where have you not been immoral? You sat waiting for them beside the highways like a nomad in the desert. You have defiled the land with your prostitution and wickedness.
Jeremiah,3,3,This is why the showers haven’t come— why there has been no spring rain. You have the brazen look of a prostitute and refuse to be ashamed.
Jeremiah,3,4,"Have you not lately called to Me, “My Father. You were my friend in my youth."
Jeremiah,3,5,"Will He bear a grudge forever? Will He be endlessly infuriated?” This is what you have said, but you have done the evil things you are capable of."
Jeremiah,3,6,"In the days of King Josiah the LORD asked me, “Have you seen what unfaithful Israel has done? She has ascended every high hill and gone under every green tree to prostitute herself there."
Jeremiah,3,7,"I thought: After she has done all these things, she will return to Me. But she didn’t return, and her treacherous sister Judah saw it."
Jeremiah,3,8,"I observed that it was because unfaithful Israel had committed adultery that I had sent her away and had given her a certificate of divorce. Nevertheless, her treacherous sister Judah was not afraid but also went and prostituted herself."
Jeremiah,3,9,"Indifferent to her prostitution, she defiled the land and committed adultery with stones and trees."
Jeremiah,3,10,"Yet in spite of all this, her treacherous sister Judah didn’t return to Me with all her heart—only in pretense.” This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,3,11,"The LORD announced to me, “Unfaithful Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah."
Jeremiah,3,12,"Go, proclaim these words to the north, and say: Return, unfaithful Israel. This is the LORD’s declaration. I will not look on you with anger, for I am unfailing in My love. This is the LORD’s declaration. I will not be angry forever."
Jeremiah,3,13,Only acknowledge your guilt— you have rebelled against the LORD your God. You have scattered your favors to strangers under every green tree and have not obeyed My voice. This is the LORD’s declaration.
Jeremiah,3,14,"“Return, you faithless children”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“for I am your master, and I will take you, one from a city and two from a family, and I will bring you to Zion."
Jeremiah,3,15,"I will give you shepherds who are loyal to Me, and they will shepherd you with knowledge and skill."
Jeremiah,3,16,"When you multiply and increase in the land, in those days”—the LORD’s declaration—“no one will say any longer, ‘The ark of the LORD’s covenant.’ It will never come to mind, and no one will remember or miss it. It will never again be made."
Jeremiah,3,17,"At that time Jerusalem will be called, Yahweh’s Throne, and all the nations will be gathered to it, to the name of Yahweh in Jerusalem. They will cease to follow the stubbornness of their evil hearts."
Jeremiah,3,18,"In those days the house of Judah will join with the house of Israel, and they will come together from the land of the north to the land I have given your ancestors to inherit.”"
Jeremiah,3,19,"I thought: How I long to make you My sons and give you a desirable land, the most beautiful inheritance of all the nations. I thought: You will call Me, my Father, and never turn away from Me."
Jeremiah,3,20,"However, as a woman may betray her lover, so you have betrayed Me, house of Israel. This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,3,21,"A sound is heard on the barren heights, the children of Israel weeping and begging for mercy, for they have perverted their way; they have forgotten the LORD their God."
Jeremiah,3,22,"Return, you faithless children. I will heal your unfaithfulness. “Here we are, coming to You, for You are the LORD our God."
Jeremiah,3,23,"Surely, falsehood comes from the hills, commotion from the mountains, but the salvation of Israel is only in the LORD our God."
Jeremiah,3,24,"From the time of our youth the shameful one has consumed what our fathers have worked for— their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters."
Jeremiah,3,25,"Let us lie down in our shame; let our disgrace cover us. We have sinned against the LORD our God, both we and our fathers, from the time of our youth even to this day. We have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.”"
Jeremiah,4,1,"If you return, Israel— this is the LORD’s declaration— you will return to Me, if you remove your detestable idols from My presence and do not waver,"
Jeremiah,4,2,"then you can swear, “As the LORD lives,” in truth, in justice, and in righteousness, then the nations will be blessed by Him and will pride themselves in Him."
Jeremiah,4,3,For this is what the LORD says to the men of Judah and Jerusalem: Break up the unplowed ground; do not sow among the thorns.
Jeremiah,4,4,"Circumcise yourselves to the LORD; remove the foreskin of your hearts, men of Judah and residents of Jerusalem. Otherwise, My wrath will break out like fire and burn with no one to extinguish it because of your evil deeds."
Jeremiah,4,5,"Declare in Judah, proclaim in Jerusalem, and say: Blow the ram’s horn throughout the land. Cry out loudly and say: Assemble yourselves, and let’s flee to the fortified cities."
Jeremiah,4,6,Lift up a signal flag toward Zion. Run for cover! Don’t stand still! For I am bringing disaster from the north— a great destruction.
Jeremiah,4,7,A lion has gone up from his thicket; a destroyer of nations has set out. He has left his lair to make your land a waste. Your cities will be reduced to uninhabited ruins.
Jeremiah,4,8,"Because of this, put on sackcloth; mourn and wail, for the LORD’s burning anger has not turned away from us."
Jeremiah,4,9,"“On that day”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“the king and the officials will lose their courage. The priests will tremble in fear, and the prophets will be scared speechless.”"
Jeremiah,4,10,"I said, “Oh no, Lord GOD, You have certainly deceived this people and Jerusalem, by announcing, ‘You will have peace,’ while a sword is at our throats.”"
Jeremiah,4,11,"“At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, ‘A searing wind blows from the barren heights in the wilderness on the way to My dear people. It comes not to winnow or to sift;"
Jeremiah,4,12,a wind too strong for this comes at My call. Now I will also pronounce judgments against them.’”
Jeremiah,4,13,"Look, he advances like clouds; his chariots are like a storm. His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us, for we are ruined!"
Jeremiah,4,14,"Wash the evil from your heart, Jerusalem, so that you will be delivered. How long will you harbor malicious thoughts within you?"
Jeremiah,4,15,"For a voice announces from Dan, proclaiming malice from Mount Ephraim."
Jeremiah,4,16,Warn the nations: Look! Proclaim to Jerusalem: Those who besiege are coming from a distant land; they raise their voices against the cities of Judah.
Jeremiah,4,17,"They have her surrounded like those who guard a field, because she has rebelled against Me. This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,4,18,"Your way of life and your actions have brought this on you. This is your punishment. It is very bitter, because it has reached your heart!"
Jeremiah,4,19,"My anguish, my anguish! I writhe in agony! Oh, the pain in my heart! My heart pounds; I cannot be silent. For you, my soul, have heard the sound of the ram’s horn— the shout of battle."
Jeremiah,4,20,"Disaster after disaster is reported because the whole land is destroyed. Suddenly my tents are destroyed, my tent curtains, in a moment."
Jeremiah,4,21,How long must I see the signal flag and hear the sound of the ram’s horn?
Jeremiah,4,22,"“For My people are fools; they do not know Me. They are foolish children, without understanding. They are skilled in doing what is evil, but they do not know how to do what is good.”"
Jeremiah,4,23,"I looked at the earth, and it was formless and empty. I looked to the heavens, and their light was gone."
Jeremiah,4,24,"I looked at the mountains, and they were quaking; all the hills shook."
Jeremiah,4,25,"I looked, and no man was left; all the birds of the sky had fled."
Jeremiah,4,26,"I looked, and the fertile field was a wilderness. All its cities were torn down because of the LORD and His burning anger."
Jeremiah,4,27,"For this is what the LORD says: The whole land will be a desolation, but I will not finish it off."
Jeremiah,4,28,"Because of this, the earth will mourn; the skies above will grow dark. I have spoken; I have planned, and I will not relent or turn back from it."
Jeremiah,4,29,Every city flees at the sound of the horseman and the archer. They enter the thickets and climb among the rocks. Every city is abandoned; no inhabitant is left.
Jeremiah,4,30,"And you, devastated one, what are you doing that you dress yourself in scarlet, that you adorn yourself with gold jewelry, that you enlarge your eyes with paint? You beautify yourself for nothing. Your lovers reject you; they want to take your life."
Jeremiah,4,31,"I hear a cry like a woman in labor, a cry of anguish like one bearing her first child. The cry of Daughter Zion gasping for breath, stretching out her hands: Woe is me, for my life is weary because of the murderers!"
Jeremiah,5,1,"Roam through the streets of Jerusalem. Look and take note; search in her squares. If you find one person, any who acts justly, who seeks to be faithful, then I will forgive her."
Jeremiah,5,2,"When they say, “As the LORD lives,” they are swearing falsely."
Jeremiah,5,3,"LORD, don’t Your eyes look for faithfulness? You have struck them, but they felt no pain. You finished them off, but they refused to accept discipline. They made their faces harder than rock, and they refused to return."
Jeremiah,5,4,"Then I thought: They are just the poor; they have played the fool. For they don’t understand the way of the LORD, the justice of their God."
Jeremiah,5,5,"I will go to the powerful and speak to them. Surely they know the way of the LORD, the justice of their God. However, these also had broken the yoke and torn off the chains."
Jeremiah,5,6,"Therefore, a lion from the forest will strike them down. A wolf from an arid plain will ravage them. A leopard keeps watch over their cities. Anyone who leaves them will be torn to pieces because their rebellious acts are many, their unfaithful deeds numerous."
Jeremiah,5,7,"Why should I forgive you? Your children have abandoned Me and sworn by those who are not gods. I satisfied their needs, yet they committed adultery; they gashed themselves at the prostitute’s house."
Jeremiah,5,8,"They are well-fed, eager stallions, each neighing after someone else’s wife."
Jeremiah,5,9,Should I not punish them for these things? This is the LORD’s declaration. Should I not avenge Myself on such a nation as this?
Jeremiah,5,10,"Go up among her vineyard terraces and destroy them, but do not finish them off. Prune away her shoots, for they do not belong to the LORD."
Jeremiah,5,11,"They, the house of Israel and the house of Judah, have dealt very treacherously with Me. This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,5,12,"They have contradicted the LORD and insisted, “It won’t happen. Harm won’t come to us; we won’t see sword or famine.”"
Jeremiah,5,13,"The prophets become only wind, for the LORD’s word is not in them. This will in fact happen to them."
Jeremiah,5,14,"Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD of Hosts says: Because you have spoken this word, I am going to make My words become fire in your mouth. These people are the wood, and the fire will consume them."
Jeremiah,5,15,"I am about to bring a nation from far away against you, house of Israel. This is the LORD’s declaration. It is an established nation, an ancient nation, a nation whose language you do not know and whose speech you do not understand."
Jeremiah,5,16,Their quiver is like an open grave; they are all mighty warriors.
Jeremiah,5,17,They will consume your harvest and your food. They will consume your sons and your daughters. They will consume your flocks and your herds. They will consume your vines and your fig trees. They will destroy with the sword your fortified cities in which you trust.
Jeremiah,5,18,“But even in those days”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“I will not finish you off.
Jeremiah,5,19,"When people ask, ‘For what offense has the LORD our God done all these things to us?’ You will respond to them: Just as you abandoned Me and served foreign gods in your land, so will you serve strangers in a land that is not yours."
Jeremiah,5,20,"“Declare this in the house of Jacob; proclaim it in Judah, saying:"
Jeremiah,5,21,"Hear this, you foolish and senseless people. They have eyes, but they don’t see. They have ears, but they don’t hear."
Jeremiah,5,22,"Do you not fear Me? This is the LORD’s declaration. Do you not tremble before Me, the One who set the sand as the boundary of the sea, an enduring barrier that it cannot cross? The waves surge, but they cannot prevail. They roar but cannot pass over it."
Jeremiah,5,23,But these people have stubborn and rebellious hearts. They have turned aside and have gone away.
Jeremiah,5,24,"They have not said to themselves, ‘Let’s fear the LORD our God, who gives the rain, both early and late, in its season, who guarantees to us the fixed weeks of the harvest.’"
Jeremiah,5,25,"Your guilty acts have diverted these things from you. Your sins have withheld My bounty from you,"
Jeremiah,5,26,for wicked men live among My people. They watch like fowlers lying in wait. They set a trap; they catch men.
Jeremiah,5,27,"Like a cage full of birds, so their houses are full of deceit. Therefore they have grown powerful and rich."
Jeremiah,5,28,"They have become fat and sleek. They have also excelled in evil matters. They have not taken up cases, such as the case of the fatherless, so they might prosper, and they have not defended the rights of the needy."
Jeremiah,5,29,Should I not punish them for these things? This is the LORD’s declaration. Should I not avenge Myself on such a nation as this?
Jeremiah,5,30,"A horrible, terrible thing has taken place in the land."
Jeremiah,5,31,"The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests rule by their own authority. My people love it like this. But what will you do at the end of it?"
Jeremiah,6,1,"“Run for cover, Benjaminites, out of Jerusalem! Sound the ram’s horn in Tekoa; raise a smoke signal over Beth-haccherem, for disaster threatens from the north, even great destruction."
Jeremiah,6,2,"Though she is beautiful and delicate, I will destroy Daughter Zion."
Jeremiah,6,3,Shepherds and their flocks will come against her; they will pitch their tents all around her. Each will pasture his own portion.
Jeremiah,6,4,"Set them apart for war against her; rise up, let’s attack at noon. Woe to us, for the day is passing; the evening shadows grow long."
Jeremiah,6,5,"Rise up, let’s attack by night. Let us destroy her fortresses.”"
Jeremiah,6,6,For this is what the LORD of Hosts says: Cut down the trees; raise a siege ramp against Jerusalem. This city must be punished. There is nothing but oppression within her.
Jeremiah,6,7,"As a well gushes out its water, so she pours out her evil. Violence and destruction resound in her. Sickness and wounds keep coming to My attention."
Jeremiah,6,8,"Be warned, Jerusalem, or I will turn away from you; I will make you a desolation, a land without inhabitants."
Jeremiah,6,9,This is what the LORD of Hosts says: Glean the remnant of Israel as thoroughly as a vine. Pass your hand once more like a grape gatherer over the branches.
Jeremiah,6,10,"Who can I speak to and give such a warning that they will listen? Look, their ear is uncircumcised, so they cannot pay attention. See, the word of the LORD has become contemptible to them— they find no pleasure in it."
Jeremiah,6,11,"But I am full of the LORD’s wrath; I am tired of holding it back. Pour it out on the children in the street, on the gang of young men as well. For both husband and wife will be captured, the old with the very old."
Jeremiah,6,12,"Their houses will be turned over to others, their fields and wives as well, for I will stretch out My hand against the inhabitants of the land. This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,6,13,"For from the least to the greatest of them, everyone is making profit dishonestly. From prophet to priest, everyone deals falsely."
Jeremiah,6,14,"They have treated My people’s brokenness superficially, claiming, “Peace, peace,” when there is no peace."
Jeremiah,6,15,"Were they ashamed when they acted so abhorrently? They weren’t at all ashamed. They can no longer feel humiliation. Therefore, they will fall among the fallen. When I punish them, they will collapse, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,6,16,"This is what the LORD says: Stand by the roadways and look. Ask about the ancient paths: Which is the way to what is good? Then take it and find rest for yourselves. But they protested, “We won’t!”"
Jeremiah,6,17,"I appointed watchmen over you and said: Listen for the sound of the ram’s horn. But they protested, “We won’t listen!”"
Jeremiah,6,18,"Therefore listen, you nations and you witnesses, learn what the charge is against them."
Jeremiah,6,19,"Listen, earth! I am about to bring disaster on these people, the fruit of their own plotting, for they have paid no attention to My word. They have rejected My instruction."
Jeremiah,6,20,What use to Me is frankincense from Sheba or sweet cane from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable; your sacrifices do not please Me.
Jeremiah,6,21,"Therefore, this is what the LORD says: I am going to place stumbling blocks before these people; fathers and sons together will stumble over them; friends and neighbors will also perish."
Jeremiah,6,22,"This is what the LORD says: Look, an army is coming from a northern land; a great nation will be awakened from the remote regions of the earth."
Jeremiah,6,23,"They grasp bow and javelin. They are cruel and show no mercy. Their voice roars like the sea, and they ride on horses, lined up like men in battle formation against you, Daughter Zion."
Jeremiah,6,24,"We have heard about it, and we are discouraged. Distress has seized us— pain like a woman in labor."
Jeremiah,6,25,Don’t go out to the fields; don’t walk on the road. For the enemy has a sword; terror is on every side.
Jeremiah,6,26,"My dear people, dress yourselves in sackcloth and roll in the dust. Mourn as you would for an only son, a bitter lament, for suddenly the destroyer will come on us."
Jeremiah,6,27,I have appointed you to be an assayer among My people— a refiner— so you may know and assay their way of life.
Jeremiah,6,28,All are stubborn rebels spreading slander. They are bronze and iron; all of them are corrupt.
Jeremiah,6,29,"The bellows blow, blasting the lead with fire. The refining is completely in vain; the evil ones are not separated out."
Jeremiah,6,30,"They are called rejected silver, for the LORD has rejected them."
Jeremiah,7,1,This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
Jeremiah,7,2,"“Stand in the gate of the house of the LORD and there call out this word: Hear the word of the LORD, all you people of Judah who enter through these gates to worship the LORD."
Jeremiah,7,3,"“This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Correct your ways and your deeds, and I will allow you to live in this place."
Jeremiah,7,4,"Do not trust deceitful words, chanting: This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD."
Jeremiah,7,5,"Instead, if you really change your ways and your actions, if you act justly toward one another,"
Jeremiah,7,6,"if you no longer oppress the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow and no longer shed innocent blood in this place or follow other gods, bringing harm on yourselves,"
Jeremiah,7,7,"I will allow you to live in this place, the land I gave to your ancestors long ago and forever."
Jeremiah,7,8,"But look, you keep trusting in deceitful words that cannot help."
Jeremiah,7,9,"“Do you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, burn incense to Baal, and follow other gods that you have not known?"
Jeremiah,7,10,"Then do you come and stand before Me in this house called by My name and say, ‘We are delivered, so we can continue doing all these detestable acts’?"
Jeremiah,7,11,"Has this house, which is called by My name, become a den of robbers in your view? Yes, I too have seen it.” This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,7,12,"“But return to My place that was at Shiloh, where I made My name dwell at first. See what I did to it because of the evil of My people Israel."
Jeremiah,7,13,"Now, because you have done all these things”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“and because I have spoken to you time and time again but you wouldn’t listen, and I have called to you, but you wouldn’t answer,"
Jeremiah,7,14,what I did to Shiloh I will do to the house that is called by My name—the house in which you trust—the place that I gave you and your ancestors.
Jeremiah,7,15,"I will drive you from My presence, just as I drove out all of your brothers, all the descendants of Ephraim."
Jeremiah,7,16,"“As for you, do not pray for these people. Do not offer a cry or a prayer on their behalf, and do not beg Me, for I will not listen to you."
Jeremiah,7,17,Don’t you see how they behave in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
Jeremiah,7,18,"The sons gather wood, the fathers light the fire, and the women knead dough to make cakes for the queen of heaven, and they pour out drink offerings to other gods so that they provoke Me to anger."
Jeremiah,7,19,But are they really provoking Me?” This is the LORD’s declaration. “Isn’t it they themselves being provoked to disgrace?”
Jeremiah,7,20,"Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says: “Look, My anger—My burning wrath—is about to be poured out on this place, on man and beast, on the tree of the field, and on the produce of the land. My wrath will burn and not be quenched.”"
Jeremiah,7,21,"This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “Add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices, and eat the meat yourselves,"
Jeremiah,7,22,"for when I brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak with them or command them concerning burnt offering and sacrifice."
Jeremiah,7,23,"However, I did give them this command: Obey Me, and then I will be your God, and you will be My people. You must follow every way I command you so that it may go well with you."
Jeremiah,7,24,"Yet they didn’t listen or pay attention but followed their own advice and according to their own stubborn, evil heart. They went backward and not forward."
Jeremiah,7,25,"Since the day your ancestors came out of the land of Egypt until this day, I have sent all My servants the prophets to you time and time again."
Jeremiah,7,26,"However, they wouldn’t listen to Me or pay attention but became obstinate; they did more evil than their ancestors."
Jeremiah,7,27,"“When you speak all these things to them, they will not listen to you. When you call to them, they will not answer you."
Jeremiah,7,28,You must therefore declare to them: This is the nation that would not listen to the voice of the LORD their God and would not accept discipline. Truth has perished—it has disappeared from their mouths.
Jeremiah,7,29,"Cut off the hair of your sacred vow and throw it away. Raise up a dirge on the barren heights, for the LORD has rejected and abandoned the generation under His wrath."
Jeremiah,7,30,“For the Judeans have done what is evil in My sight.” This is the LORD’s declaration. “They have set up their detestable things in the house that is called by My name and defiled it.
Jeremiah,7,31,"They have built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Hinnom in order to burn their sons and daughters in the fire, a thing I did not command; I never entertained the thought."
Jeremiah,7,32,"“Therefore, take note! Days are coming”—the LORD’s declaration—“when this place will no longer be called Topheth and the Valley of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter. Topheth will become a cemetery, because there will be no other burial place."
Jeremiah,7,33,"The corpses of these people will become food for the birds of the sky and for the wild animals of the land, with no one to scare them away."
Jeremiah,7,34,"I will remove from the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem the sound of joy and gladness and the voices of the groom and the bride, for the land will become a desolate waste."
Jeremiah,8,1,"“At that time”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of her officials, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the residents of Jerusalem will be brought out of their graves."
Jeremiah,8,2,"They will be exposed to the sun, the moon, and the whole heavenly host, which they have loved, served, followed, consulted, and worshiped. Their bones will not be collected and buried but will become like manure on the surface of the soil."
Jeremiah,8,3,"Death will be chosen over life by all the survivors of this evil family, those who remain wherever I have banished them.” This is the declaration of the LORD of Hosts."
Jeremiah,8,4,"“You are to say to them: This is what the LORD says: Do people fall and not get up again? If they turn away, do they not return?"
Jeremiah,8,5,Why have these people turned away? Why is Jerusalem always turning away? They take hold of deceit; they refuse to return.
Jeremiah,8,6,"I have paid careful attention. They do not speak what is right. No one regrets his evil, asking, ‘What have I done?’ Everyone has stayed his course like a horse rushing into battle."
Jeremiah,8,7,"Even the stork in the sky knows her seasons. The turtledove, swallow, and crane are aware of their migration, but My people do not know the requirements of the LORD."
Jeremiah,8,8,"“How can you claim, ‘We are wise; the law of the LORD is with us’? In fact, the lying pen of scribes has produced falsehood."
Jeremiah,8,9,"The wise will be put to shame; they will be dismayed and snared. They have rejected the word of the LORD, so what wisdom do they really have?"
Jeremiah,8,10,"Therefore, I will give their wives to other men, their fields to new occupants, for from the least to the greatest, everyone is making profit dishonestly. From prophet to priest, everyone deals falsely."
Jeremiah,8,11,"They have treated superficially the brokenness of My dear people, claiming, ‘Peace, peace,’ when there is no peace."
Jeremiah,8,12,"Were they ashamed when they acted so abhorrently? They weren’t at all ashamed. They can no longer feel humiliation. Therefore, they will fall among the fallen. When I punish them, they will collapse,” says the LORD."
Jeremiah,8,13,"I will gather them and bring them to an end. This is the LORD’s declaration. There will be no grapes on the vine, no figs on the fig tree, and even the leaf will wither. Whatever I have given them will be lost to them."
Jeremiah,8,14,"Why are we just sitting here? Gather together; let us enter the fortified cities and perish there, for the LORD our God has destroyed us. He has given us poisoned water to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD."
Jeremiah,8,15,"We hoped for peace, but there was nothing good; for a time of healing, but there was only terror."
Jeremiah,8,16,"From Dan the snorting of horses is heard. At the sound of the neighing of mighty steeds, the whole land quakes. They come to devour the land and everything in it, the city and all its residents."
Jeremiah,8,17,"Indeed, I am about to send snakes among you, poisonous vipers that cannot be charmed. They will bite you. This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,8,18,My joy has flown away; grief has settled on me. My heart is sick.
Jeremiah,8,19,"Listen—the cry of my dear people from a far away land, “Is the LORD no longer in Zion, her King not within her?” Why have they provoked me to anger with their carved images, with their worthless foreign idols?"
Jeremiah,8,20,"Harvest has passed, summer has ended, but we have not been saved."
Jeremiah,8,21,I am broken by the brokenness of my dear people. I mourn; horror has taken hold of me.
Jeremiah,8,22,Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? So why has the healing of my dear people not come about?
Jeremiah,9,1,"If my head were a spring of water, my eyes a fountain of tears, I would weep day and night over the slain of my dear people."
Jeremiah,9,2,"If only I had a traveler’s lodging place in the wilderness, I would abandon my people and depart from them, for they are all adulterers, a solemn assembly of treacherous people."
Jeremiah,9,3,"They bent their tongues like their bows; lies and not faithfulness prevail in the land, for they proceed from one evil to another, and they do not take Me into account. This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,9,4,"Everyone has to be on guard against his friend. Don’t trust any brother, for every brother will certainly deceive, and every friend spread slander."
Jeremiah,9,5,Each one betrays his friend; no one tells the truth. They have taught their tongues to speak lies; they wear themselves out doing wrong.
Jeremiah,9,6,You live in a world of deception. In their deception they refuse to know Me. This is the LORD’s declaration.
Jeremiah,9,7,"Therefore, this is what the LORD of Hosts says: I am about to refine them and test them, for what else can I do because of My dear people?"
Jeremiah,9,8,"Their tongues are deadly arrows— they speak deception. With his mouth a man speaks peaceably with his friend, but inwardly he sets up an ambush."
Jeremiah,9,9,Should I not punish them for these things? This is the LORD’s declaration. Should I not avenge Myself on such a nation as this?
Jeremiah,9,10,"I will raise weeping and a lament over the mountains, a dirge over the wilderness grazing land, for they have been so scorched that no one passes through. The sound of cattle is no longer heard. From the birds of the sky to the animals, everything has fled—they have gone away."
Jeremiah,9,11,"I will make Jerusalem a heap of rubble, a jackals’ den. I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, an uninhabited place."
Jeremiah,9,12,"Who is the man wise enough to understand this? Who has the LORD spoken to, that he may explain it? Why is the land destroyed and scorched like a wilderness, so no one can pass through?"
Jeremiah,9,13,"The LORD said, “It is because they abandoned My instruction that I set in front of them and did not obey My voice or walk according to it."
Jeremiah,9,14,"Instead, they followed the stubbornness of their hearts and followed after the Baals as their fathers taught them.”"
Jeremiah,9,15,"Therefore, this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “I am about to feed this people wormwood and give them poisonous water to drink."
Jeremiah,9,16,I will scatter them among the nations that they and their fathers have not known. I will send a sword after them until I have finished them off.”
Jeremiah,9,17,"This is what the LORD of Hosts says: Consider, and summon the women who mourn; send for the skillful women."
Jeremiah,9,18,"Let them come quickly to raise a lament over us so that our eyes may overflow with tears, our eyelids soaked with weeping."
Jeremiah,9,19,"For a sound of lamentation is heard from Zion: How devastated we are. We are greatly ashamed, for we have abandoned the land; our dwellings have been torn down."
Jeremiah,9,20,"Now hear the word of the LORD, you women. Pay attention to the word of His mouth. Teach your daughters a lament and one another a dirge,"
Jeremiah,9,21,"for Death has climbed through our windows; it has entered our fortresses, cutting off children from the streets, young men from the squares."
Jeremiah,9,22,"Speak as follows: This is what the LORD says: Human corpses will fall like manure on the surface of the field, like newly cut grain after the reaper with no one to gather it."
Jeremiah,9,23,This is what the LORD says: The wise man must not boast in his wisdom; the strong man must not boast in his strength; the wealthy man must not boast in his wealth.
Jeremiah,9,24,"But the one who boasts should boast in this, that he understands and knows Me— that I am Yahweh, showing faithful love, justice, and righteousness on the earth, for I delight in these things. This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,9,25,“The days are coming”—the LORD’s declaration—“when I will punish all the circumcised yet uncircumcised:
Jeremiah,9,26,"Egypt, Judah, Edom, the Ammonites, Moab, and all the inhabitants of the desert who clip the hair on their temples. All these nations are uncircumcised, and the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.”"
Jeremiah,10,1,"Hear the word that the LORD has spoken to you, house of Israel."
Jeremiah,10,2,"This is what the LORD says: Do not learn the way of the nations or be terrified by signs in the heavens, although the nations are terrified by them,"
Jeremiah,10,3,for the customs of the peoples are worthless. Someone cuts down a tree from the forest; it is worked by the hands of a craftsman with a chisel.
Jeremiah,10,4,"He decorates it with silver and gold. It is fastened with hammer and nails, so it won’t totter."
Jeremiah,10,5,"Like scarecrows in a cucumber patch, their idols cannot speak. They must be carried because they cannot walk. Do not fear them for they can do no harm— and they cannot do any good."
Jeremiah,10,6,"Yahweh, there is no one like You. You are great; Your name is great in power."
Jeremiah,10,7,"Who should not fear You, King of the nations? It is what You deserve. For among all the wise people of the nations and among all their kingdoms, there is no one like You."
Jeremiah,10,8,"They are both stupid and foolish, instructed by worthless idols made of wood!"
Jeremiah,10,9,"Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz from the hands of a goldsmith, the work of a craftsman. Their clothing is blue and purple, all the work of skilled artisans."
Jeremiah,10,10,"But Yahweh is the true God; He is the living God and eternal King. The earth quakes at His wrath, and the nations cannot endure His rage."
Jeremiah,10,11,"You are to say this to them, “The gods that did not make the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth and from under these heavens.”"
Jeremiah,10,12,"He made the earth by His power, established the world by His wisdom, and spread out the heavens by His understanding."
Jeremiah,10,13,"When He thunders, the waters in the heavens are in turmoil, and He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain and brings the wind from His storehouses."
Jeremiah,10,14,"Everyone is stupid and ignorant. Every goldsmith is put to shame by his carved image, for his cast images are a lie; there is no breath in them."
Jeremiah,10,15,"They are worthless, a work to be mocked. At the time of their punishment they will be destroyed."
Jeremiah,10,16,Jacob’s Portion is not like these because He is the One who formed all things. Israel is the tribe of His inheritance; Yahweh of Hosts is His name.
Jeremiah,10,17,"Gather up your belongings from the ground, you who live under siege."
Jeremiah,10,18,"For this is what the LORD says: Look, I am slinging out the land’s residents at this time and bringing them such distress that they will feel it."
Jeremiah,10,19,"Woe to me because of my brokenness— I am severely wounded! I exclaimed, “This is my intense suffering, but I must bear it.”"
Jeremiah,10,20,My tent is destroyed; all my tent cords are snapped. My sons have departed from me and are no more. I have no one to pitch my tent again or to hang up my curtains.
Jeremiah,10,21,"For the shepherds are stupid: they don’t seek the LORD. Therefore they have not prospered, and their whole flock is scattered."
Jeremiah,10,22,"Listen! A noise—it is coming— a great commotion from the land to the north. The cities of Judah will be made desolate, a jackals’ den."
Jeremiah,10,23,"I know, LORD, that a man’s way of life is not his own; no one who walks determines his own steps."
Jeremiah,10,24,"Discipline me, LORD, but with justice— not in Your anger, or You will reduce me to nothing."
Jeremiah,10,25,"Pour out Your wrath on the nations that don’t recognize You and on the families that don’t call on Your name, for they have consumed Jacob; they have consumed him and finished him off and made his homeland desolate."
Jeremiah,11,1,This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
Jeremiah,11,2,“Listen to the words of this covenant and tell them to the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,11,3,"You must tell them: This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Let a curse be on the man who does not obey the words of this covenant,"
Jeremiah,11,4,"which I commanded your ancestors when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace.’ I declared: ‘Obey Me, and do everything that I command you, and you will be My people, and I will be your God,’"
Jeremiah,11,5,"in order to establish the oath I swore to your ancestors, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is today.” I answered, “Amen, LORD.”"
Jeremiah,11,6,"The LORD said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: Obey the words of this covenant and carry them out."
Jeremiah,11,7,"For I strongly warned your ancestors when I brought them out of the land of Egypt until today, warning them time and time again, ‘Obey My voice.’"
Jeremiah,11,8,"Yet they would not obey or pay attention; each one followed the stubbornness of his evil heart. So I brought on them all the curses of this covenant, because they had not done what I commanded them to do.”"
Jeremiah,11,9,"The LORD said to me, “A conspiracy has been discovered among the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,11,10,They have returned to the sins of their ancestors who refused to obey My words and have followed other gods to worship them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah broke My covenant I made with their ancestors.
Jeremiah,11,11,"“Therefore, this is what the LORD says: I am about to bring on them disaster that they cannot escape. They will cry out to Me, but I will not hear them."
Jeremiah,11,12,"Then the cities of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods they have been burning incense to, but they certainly will not save them in their time of disaster."
Jeremiah,11,13,"Your gods are indeed as numerous as your cities, Judah, and the altars you have set up to Shame—altars to burn incense to Baal—as numerous as the streets of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,11,14,"“As for you, do not pray for these people. Do not raise up a cry or a prayer on their behalf, for I will not be listening when they call out to Me at the time of their disaster."
Jeremiah,11,15,"What right does My beloved have to be in My house, having carried out so many evil schemes? Can holy meat prevent your disaster so you can rejoice?"
Jeremiah,11,16,"The LORD named you a flourishing olive tree, beautiful with well-formed fruit. He has set fire to it, and its branches are consumed with a great roaring sound."
Jeremiah,11,17,"“The LORD of Hosts who planted you has decreed disaster against you, because of the harm the house of Israel and the house of Judah brought on themselves, provoking Me to anger by burning incense to Baal.”"
Jeremiah,11,18,"The LORD informed me, so I knew. Then You helped me to see their deeds,"
Jeremiah,11,19,for I was like a docile lamb led to slaughter. I didn’t know that they had devised plots against me: “Let’s destroy the tree with its fruit; let’s cut him off from the land of the living so that his name will no longer be remembered.”
Jeremiah,11,20,"But, LORD of Hosts, who judges righteously, who tests heart and mind, let me see Your vengeance on them, for I have presented my case to You."
Jeremiah,11,21,"Therefore, here is what the LORD says concerning the people of Anathoth who want to take your life. They warn, “You must not prophesy in the name of Yahweh, or you will certainly die at our hand.”"
Jeremiah,11,22,"Therefore, this is what the LORD of Hosts says: “I am about to punish them. The young men will die by the sword; their sons and daughters will die by famine."
Jeremiah,11,23,"They will have no remnant, for I will bring disaster on the people of Anathoth in the year of their punishment.”"
Jeremiah,12,1,"You will be righteous, LORD, even if I bring a case against You. Yet, I wish to contend with You: Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why do all the treacherous live at ease?"
Jeremiah,12,2,"You planted them, and they have taken root. They have grown and produced fruit. You are ever on their lips, but far from their conscience."
Jeremiah,12,3,"As for You, LORD, You know me; You see me. You test whether my heart is with You. Drag the wicked away like sheep to slaughter and set them apart for the day of killing."
Jeremiah,12,4,"How long will the land mourn and the grass of every field wither? Because of the evil of its residents, animals and birds have been swept away, for the people have said, “He cannot see what our end will be.”"
Jeremiah,12,5,"If you have raced with runners and they have worn you out, how can you compete with horses? If you stumble in a peaceful land, what will you do in the thickets of the Jordan?"
Jeremiah,12,6,"Even your brothers—your own father’s household— even they were treacherous to you; even they have cried out loudly after you. Do not have confidence in them, though they speak well of you."
Jeremiah,12,7,I have abandoned My house; I have deserted My inheritance. I have given the love of My life into the hands of her enemies.
Jeremiah,12,8,"My inheritance has acted toward Me like a lion in the forest. She has roared against Me. Therefore, I hate her."
Jeremiah,12,9,"Is My inheritance like a hyena to Me? Are birds of prey circling her? Go, gather all the wild animals; bring them to devour her."
Jeremiah,12,10,Many shepherds have destroyed My vineyard; they have trampled My plot of land. They have turned My desirable plot into a desolate wasteland.
Jeremiah,12,11,"They have made it a desolation. It mourns, desolate, before Me. All the land is desolate, but no one takes it to heart."
Jeremiah,12,12,"Over all the barren heights in the wilderness the destroyers have come, for the LORD has a sword that devours from one end of the earth to the other. No one has peace."
Jeremiah,12,13,They have sown wheat but harvested thorns. They have exhausted themselves but have no profit. Be put to shame by your harvests because of the LORD’s burning anger.
Jeremiah,12,14,"This is what the LORD says: “Concerning all My evil neighbors who attack the inheritance that I bequeathed to My people, Israel, I am about to uproot them from their land, and I will uproot the house of Judah from them."
Jeremiah,12,15,"After I have uprooted them, I will once again have compassion on them and return each one to his inheritance and to his land."
Jeremiah,12,16,"If they will diligently learn the ways of My people—to swear by My name, ‘As Yahweh lives,’ just as they taught My people to swear by Baal—they will be built up among My people."
Jeremiah,12,17,"However, if they will not obey, then I will uproot and destroy that nation.” This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,13,1,"This is what the LORD said to me: “Go and buy yourself a linen undergarment and put it on, but do not put it in water.”"
Jeremiah,13,2,So I bought underwear as the LORD instructed me and put it on.
Jeremiah,13,3,Then the word of the LORD came to me a second time:
Jeremiah,13,4,"“Take the underwear that you bought and are wearing, and go at once to the Euphrates and hide it in a rocky crevice.”"
Jeremiah,13,5,"So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me."
Jeremiah,13,6,"A long time later the LORD said to me, “Go at once to the Euphrates and get the underwear that I commanded you to hide there.”"
Jeremiah,13,7,"So I went to the Euphrates and dug up the underwear and got it from the place where I had hidden it, but it was ruined—of no use at all."
Jeremiah,13,8,Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Jeremiah,13,9,“This is what the LORD says: Just like this I will ruin the great pride of both Judah and Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,13,10,"These evil people, who refuse to listen to Me, who follow the stubbornness of their own hearts, and who have followed other gods to serve and worship—they will be like this underwear, of no use at all."
Jeremiah,13,11,"Just as underwear clings to one’s waist, so I fastened the whole house of Israel and of Judah to Me”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“so that they might be My people for My fame, praise, and glory, but they would not obey."
Jeremiah,13,12,"“Say this to them: This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Every jar should be filled with wine. Then they will respond to you, ‘Don’t we know that every jar should be filled with wine?’"
Jeremiah,13,13,"And you will say to them: This is what the LORD says: I am about to fill all who live in this land—the kings who reign for David on his throne, the priests, the prophets and all the residents of Jerusalem—with drunkenness."
Jeremiah,13,14,"I will smash them against each other, fathers and sons alike”—this is the LORD’s declaration. “I will allow no mercy, pity, or compassion to keep Me from destroying them.”"
Jeremiah,13,15,"Listen and pay attention. Do not be proud, for the LORD has spoken."
Jeremiah,13,16,"Give glory to the LORD your God before He brings darkness, before your feet stumble on the mountains at dusk. You wait for light, but He brings darkest gloom and makes thick darkness."
Jeremiah,13,17,"But if you will not listen, my innermost being will weep in secret because of your pride. My eyes will overflow with tears, for the LORD’s flock has been taken captive."
Jeremiah,13,18,"Say to the king and the queen mother: Take a humble seat, for your glorious crowns have fallen from your heads."
Jeremiah,13,19,"The cities of the Negev are under siege; no one can help them. All of Judah has been taken into exile, taken completely into exile."
Jeremiah,13,20,"Look up and see those coming from the north. Where is the flock entrusted to you, the sheep that were your pride?"
Jeremiah,13,21,"What will you say when He appoints close friends as leaders over you, ones you yourself trained? Won’t labor pains seize you, as they do a woman in labor?"
Jeremiah,13,22,"And when you ask yourself, “Why have these things happened to me?” It is because of your great guilt that your skirts have been stripped off, your body exposed."
Jeremiah,13,23,"Can the Cushite change his skin, or a leopard his spots? If so, you might be able to do what is good, you who are instructed in evil."
Jeremiah,13,24,I will scatter you like drifting chaff before the desert wind.
Jeremiah,13,25,"This is your lot, what I have decreed for you— this is the LORD’s declaration— because you have forgotten Me and trusted in Falsehood."
Jeremiah,13,26,I will pull your skirts up over your face so that your shame might be seen.
Jeremiah,13,27,"Your adulteries and your lustful neighing, your heinous prostitution on the hills, in the fields— I have seen your detestable acts. Woe to you, Jerusalem! You are unclean— for how long yet?"
Jeremiah,14,1,The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought:
Jeremiah,14,2,Judah mourns; her gates languish. Her people are on the ground in mourning; Jerusalem’s cry rises up.
Jeremiah,14,3,Their nobles send their servants for water. They go to the cisterns; they find no water; their containers return empty. They are ashamed and humiliated; they cover their heads.
Jeremiah,14,4,The ground is cracked since no rain has fallen on the land. The farmers are ashamed; they cover their heads.
Jeremiah,14,5,Even the doe in the field gives birth and abandons her fawn since there is no grass.
Jeremiah,14,6,Wild donkeys stand on the barren heights panting for air like jackals. Their eyes fail because there are no green plants.
Jeremiah,14,7,"Though our guilt testifies against us, Yahweh, act for Your name’s sake. Indeed, our rebellions are many; we have sinned against You."
Jeremiah,14,8,"Hope of Israel, its Savior in time of distress, why are You like a foreigner in the land, like a traveler stopping only for the night?"
Jeremiah,14,9,"Why are You like a helpless man, like a warrior unable to save? Yet You are among us, Yahweh, and we are called by Your name. Don’t leave us!"
Jeremiah,14,10,This is what the LORD says concerning these people: Truly they love to wander; they never rest their feet. So the LORD does not accept them. Now He will remember their guilt and punish their sins.
Jeremiah,14,11,"Then the LORD said to me, “Do not pray for the well-being of these people."
Jeremiah,14,12,"If they fast, I will not hear their cry of despair. If they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I will not accept them. Rather, I will finish them off by sword, famine, and plague.”"
Jeremiah,14,13,"And I replied, “Oh no, Lord GOD! The prophets are telling them, ‘You won’t see sword or suffer famine. I will certainly give you true peace in this place.’”"
Jeremiah,14,14,"But the LORD said to me, “These prophets are prophesying a lie in My name. I did not send them, nor did I command them or speak to them. They are prophesying to you a false vision, worthless divination, the deceit of their own minds."
Jeremiah,14,15,"“Therefore, this is what the LORD says concerning the prophets who prophesy in My name, though I did not send them, and who say, ‘There will never be sword or famine in this land.’ By sword and famine these prophets will meet their end."
Jeremiah,14,16,"The people they are prophesying to will be thrown into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword. There will be no one to bury them—they, their wives, their sons, and their daughters. I will pour out their own evil on them.”"
Jeremiah,14,17,"You are to speak this word to them: Let my eyes overflow with tears; day and night may they not stop, for the virgin daughter of my people has been destroyed by a great disaster, an extremely severe wound."
Jeremiah,14,18,"If I go out to the field, look—those slain by the sword! If I enter the city, look—those ill from famine! For both prophet and priest travel to a land they do not know."
Jeremiah,14,19,"Have You completely rejected Judah? Do You detest Zion? Why do You strike us with no hope of healing for us? We hoped for peace, but there was nothing good; for a time of healing, but there was only terror."
Jeremiah,14,20,"We acknowledge our wickedness, LORD, the guilt of our fathers; indeed, we have sinned against You."
Jeremiah,14,21,"Because of Your name, don’t despise us. Don’t disdain Your glorious throne. Remember Your covenant with us; do not break it."
Jeremiah,14,22,"Can any of the worthless idols of the nations bring rain? Or can the skies alone give showers? Are You not the LORD our God? We therefore put our hope in You, for You have done all these things."
Jeremiah,15,1,"Then the LORD said to me: “Even if Moses and Samuel should stand before Me, My compassions would not reach out to these people. Send them from My presence, and let them go."
Jeremiah,15,2,"If they ask you, ‘Where will we go?’ you must tell them: This is what the LORD says: Those destined for death, to death; those destined for the sword, to the sword. Those destined for famine, to famine; those destined for captivity, to captivity."
Jeremiah,15,3,"“I will ordain four kinds of judgment for them”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“the sword to kill, the dogs to drag away, and the birds of the sky and the wild animals of the land to devour and destroy."
Jeremiah,15,4,"I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth because of Manasseh son of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,15,5,"Who will have pity on you, Jerusalem? Who will show sympathy toward you? Who will turn aside to ask about your welfare?"
Jeremiah,15,6,"You have left Me. This is the LORD’s declaration. You have turned your back, so I have stretched out My hand against you and destroyed you. I am tired of showing compassion."
Jeremiah,15,7,I scattered them with a winnowing fork at the gates of the land. I made them childless; I destroyed My people. They would not turn from their ways.
Jeremiah,15,8,I made their widows more numerous than the sand of the seas. I brought a destroyer at noon against the mother of young men. I suddenly released on her agitation and terrors.
Jeremiah,15,9,The mother of seven grew faint; she breathed her last breath. Her sun set while it was still day; she was ashamed and humiliated. The rest of them I will give over to the sword in the presence of their enemies.” This is the LORD’s declaration.
Jeremiah,15,10,"Woe is me, my mother, that you gave birth to me, a man who incites dispute and conflict in all the land. I did not lend or borrow, yet everyone curses me."
Jeremiah,15,11,"The LORD said: I will certainly set you free and care for you. I will certainly intercede for you in a time of trouble, in your time of distress, with the enemy."
Jeremiah,15,12,"Can anyone smash iron, iron from the north, or bronze?"
Jeremiah,15,13,"I will give up your wealth and your treasures as plunder, without cost, for all your sins in all your borders."
Jeremiah,15,14,"Then I will make you serve your enemies in a land you do not know, for My anger will kindle a fire that will burn against you."
Jeremiah,15,15,"You know, LORD; remember me and take note of me. Avenge me against my persecutors. In Your patience, don’t take me away. Know that I suffer disgrace for Your honor."
Jeremiah,15,16,"Your words were found, and I ate them. Your words became a delight to me and the joy of my heart, for I am called by Your name, Yahweh God of Hosts."
Jeremiah,15,17,"I never sat with the band of revelers, and I did not celebrate with them. Because Your hand was on me, I sat alone, for You filled me with indignation."
Jeremiah,15,18,"Why has my pain become unending, my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? You truly have become like a mirage to me— water that is not reliable."
Jeremiah,15,19,"Therefore, this is what the LORD says: If you return, I will restore you; you will stand in My presence. And if you speak noble words, rather than worthless ones, you will be My spokesman. It is they who must return to you; you must not return to them."
Jeremiah,15,20,"Then I will make you a fortified wall of bronze to this people. They will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you to save you and deliver you. This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,15,21,I will deliver you from the power of evil people and redeem you from the control of the ruthless.
Jeremiah,16,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Jeremiah,16,2,“You must not marry or have sons or daughters in this place.
Jeremiah,16,3,For this is what the LORD says concerning sons and daughters born in this place as well as concerning the mothers who bear them and the fathers who father them in this land:
Jeremiah,16,4,They will die from deadly diseases. They will not be mourned or buried but will be like manure on the face of the earth. They will be finished off by sword and famine. Their corpses will become food for the birds of the sky and for the wild animals of the land.
Jeremiah,16,5,"“For this is what the LORD says: Don’t enter a house where a mourning feast is taking place. Don’t go to lament or sympathize with them, for I have removed My peace from these people”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“as well as My faithful love and compassion."
Jeremiah,16,6,"Both great and small will die in this land without burial. No lament will be made for them, nor will anyone cut himself or shave his head for them."
Jeremiah,16,7,Food won’t be provided for the mourner to comfort him because of the dead. A cup of consolation won’t be given him because of the loss of his father or mother.
Jeremiah,16,8,You must not enter the house where feasting is taking place to sit with them to eat and drink.
Jeremiah,16,9,"For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am about to eliminate from this place, before your very eyes and in your time, the sound of joy and gladness, the voice of the groom and the bride."
Jeremiah,16,10,"“When you tell these people all these things, they will say to you, ‘Why has the LORD declared all this great disaster against us? What is our guilt? What is our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?’"
Jeremiah,16,11,"Then you will answer them: Because your fathers abandoned Me”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“and followed other gods, served them, and worshiped them. Indeed, they abandoned Me and did not keep My instruction."
Jeremiah,16,12,"You did more evil than your fathers. Look, each one of you was following the stubbornness of his evil heart, not obeying Me."
Jeremiah,16,13,"So I will hurl you from this land into a land that you and your fathers are not familiar with. There you will worship other gods both day and night, for I will not grant you grace."
Jeremiah,16,14,"“However, take note! The days are coming”—the LORD’s declaration—“when it will no longer be said, ‘As the LORD lives who brought the Israelites from the land of Egypt,’"
Jeremiah,16,15,"but rather, ‘As the LORD lives who brought the Israelites from the land of the north and from all the other lands where He had banished them.’ For I will return them to their land that I gave to their ancestors."
Jeremiah,16,16,"“I am about to send for many fishermen”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“and they will fish for them. Then I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them down on every mountain and hill and out of the clefts of the rocks,"
Jeremiah,16,17,"for My gaze takes in all their ways. They are not concealed from Me, and their guilt is not hidden from My sight."
Jeremiah,16,18,I will first repay them double for their guilt and sin because they have polluted My land. They have filled My inheritance with the lifelessness of their detestable and abhorrent idols.”
Jeremiah,16,19,"LORD, my strength and my stronghold, my refuge in a time of distress, the nations will come to You from the ends of the earth, and they will say, “Our fathers inherited only lies, worthless idols of no benefit at all.”"
Jeremiah,16,20,Can one make gods for himself? But they are not gods.
Jeremiah,16,21,"“Therefore, I am about to inform them, and this time I will make them know My power and My might; then they will know that My name is Yahweh.”"
Jeremiah,17,1,"The sin of Judah is written with an iron stylus. With a diamond point it is engraved on the tablet of their hearts and on the horns of their altars,"
Jeremiah,17,2,"while their children remember their altars and their Asherah poles, by the green trees on the high hills—"
Jeremiah,17,3,My mountains in the countryside. I will give up your wealth and all your treasures as plunder because of the sin of your high places in all your borders.
Jeremiah,17,4,"You will, on your own, relinquish your inheritance that I gave you. I will make you serve your enemies in a land you do not know, for you have set My anger on fire; it will burn forever."
Jeremiah,17,5,"This is what the LORD says: The man who trusts in mankind, who makes human flesh his strength and turns his heart from the LORD is cursed."
Jeremiah,17,6,"He will be like a juniper in the Arabah; he cannot see when good comes but dwells in the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land where no one lives."
Jeremiah,17,7,"The man who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence indeed is the LORD, is blessed."
Jeremiah,17,8,"He will be like a tree planted by water: it sends its roots out toward a stream, it doesn’t fear when heat comes, and its foliage remains green. It will not worry in a year of drought or cease producing fruit."
Jeremiah,17,9,"The heart is more deceitful than anything else, and incurable—who can understand it?"
Jeremiah,17,10,"I, Yahweh, examine the mind, I test the heart to give to each according to his way, according to what his actions deserve."
Jeremiah,17,11,"He who makes a fortune unjustly is like a partridge that hatches eggs it didn’t lay. In the middle of his days his riches will abandon him, so in the end he will be a fool."
Jeremiah,17,12,A throne of glory on high from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary.
Jeremiah,17,13,"LORD, the hope of Israel, all who abandon You will be put to shame. All who turn away from Me will be written in the dirt, for they have abandoned the LORD, the fountain of living water."
Jeremiah,17,14,"Heal me, LORD, and I will be healed; save me, and I will be saved, for You are my praise."
Jeremiah,17,15,"Hear how they keep challenging me, “Where is the word of the LORD? Let it come!”"
Jeremiah,17,16,"But I have not run away from being Your shepherd, and I have not longed for the fatal day. You know my words were spoken in Your presence."
Jeremiah,17,17,Don’t become a terror to me. You are my refuge in the day of disaster.
Jeremiah,17,18,"Let my persecutors be put to shame, but don’t let me be put to shame. Let them be terrified, but don’t let me be terrified. Bring on them the day of disaster; shatter them with total destruction."
Jeremiah,17,19,"This is what the LORD said to me, “Go and stand at the People’s Gate, through which the kings of Judah enter and leave, as well as at all the gates of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,17,20,"Announce to them: Hear the word of the LORD, kings of Judah, all Judah, and all the residents of Jerusalem who enter through these gates."
Jeremiah,17,21,This is what the LORD says: Watch yourselves; do not pick up a load and bring it in through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day.
Jeremiah,17,22,"You must not carry a load out of your houses on the Sabbath day or do any work, but you must consecrate the Sabbath day, just as I commanded your ancestors."
Jeremiah,17,23,"They wouldn’t listen or pay attention but became obstinate, not listening or accepting discipline."
Jeremiah,17,24,"“However, if you listen to Me, says the LORD, and do not bring loads through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day and consecrate the Sabbath day and do no work on it,"
Jeremiah,17,25,"kings and princes will enter through the gates of this city. They will sit on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses with their officials, the men of Judah, and the residents of Jerusalem. This city will be inhabited forever."
Jeremiah,17,26,"Then people will come from the cities of Judah and from the area around Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin and from the Judean foothills, from the hill country and from the Negev bringing burnt offerings and sacrifice, grain offerings and frankincense, and thank offerings to the house of the LORD."
Jeremiah,17,27,"If you do not listen to Me to consecrate the Sabbath day by not carrying a load while entering the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, I will set fire to its gates, and it will consume the citadels of Jerusalem and not be extinguished.”"
Jeremiah,18,1,This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
Jeremiah,18,2,“Go down at once to the potter’s house; there I will reveal My words to you.”
Jeremiah,18,3,"So I went down to the potter’s house, and there he was, working away at the wheel."
Jeremiah,18,4,"But the jar that he was making from the clay became flawed in the potter’s hand, so he made it into another jar, as it seemed right for him to do."
Jeremiah,18,5,The word of the LORD came to me:
Jeremiah,18,6,"“House of Israel, can I not treat you as this potter treats his clay?”—this is the LORD’s declaration. “Just like clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in My hand, house of Israel."
Jeremiah,18,7,"At one moment I might announce concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will uproot, tear down, and destroy it."
Jeremiah,18,8,"However, if that nation I have made an announcement about turns from its evil, I will relent concerning the disaster I had planned to do to it."
Jeremiah,18,9,At another time I announce that I will build and plant a nation or a kingdom.
Jeremiah,18,10,"However, if it does what is evil in My sight by not listening to My voice, I will relent concerning the good I had said I would do to it."
Jeremiah,18,11,"So now, say to the men of Judah and to the residents of Jerusalem: This is what the LORD says: I am about to bring harm to you and make plans against you. Turn now, each from your evil way, and correct your ways and your deeds."
Jeremiah,18,12,"But they will say, ‘It’s hopeless. We will continue to follow our plans, and each of us will continue to act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.’”"
Jeremiah,18,13,"Therefore, this is what the LORD says: Ask among the nations, Who has heard things like these? Virgin Israel has done a most terrible thing."
Jeremiah,18,14,Does the snow of Lebanon ever leave the highland crags? Or does cold water flowing from a distance ever fail?
Jeremiah,18,15,"Yet My people have forgotten Me. They burn incense to false idols that make them stumble in their ways on the ancient roads and walk on new paths, not the highway."
Jeremiah,18,16,"They have made their land a horror, a perpetual object of scorn; everyone who passes by it will be horrified and shake his head."
Jeremiah,18,17,I will scatter them before the enemy like the east wind. I will show them My back and not My face on the day of their calamity.
Jeremiah,18,18,"Then certain ones said, “Come, let’s make plans against Jeremiah, for instruction will never be lost from the priest, or counsel from the wise, or an oracle from the prophet. Come, let’s denounce him and pay no attention to all his words.”"
Jeremiah,18,19,"Pay attention to me, LORD. Hear what my opponents are saying!"
Jeremiah,18,20,"Should good be repaid with evil? Yet they have dug a pit for me. Remember how I stood before You to speak good on their behalf, to turn Your anger from them."
Jeremiah,18,21,"Therefore, hand their children over to famine, and pour the sword’s power on them. Let their wives become childless and widowed, their husbands slain by deadly disease, their young men struck down by the sword in battle."
Jeremiah,18,22,"Let a cry be heard from their houses when You suddenly bring raiders against them, for they have dug a pit to capture me and have hidden snares for my feet."
Jeremiah,18,23,"But You, LORD, know all their deadly plots against me. Do not wipe out their guilt; do not blot out their sin before You. Let them be forced to stumble before You; deal with them in the time of Your anger."
Jeremiah,19,1,"This is what the LORD says: “Go, buy a potter’s clay jar. Take some of the elders of the people and some of the leading priests"
Jeremiah,19,2,and go out to the Valley of Hinnom near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate. Proclaim there the words I speak to you.
Jeremiah,19,3,"Say: Hear the word of the LORD, kings of Judah and residents of Jerusalem. This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am going to bring such disaster on this place that everyone who hears about it will shudder"
Jeremiah,19,4,"because they have abandoned Me and made this a foreign place. They have burned incense in it to other gods that they, their fathers, and the kings of Judah have never known. They have filled this place with the blood of the innocent."
Jeremiah,19,5,"They have built high places to Baal on which to burn their children in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, something I have never commanded or mentioned; I never entertained the thought."
Jeremiah,19,6,"“Therefore, take note! The days are coming”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“when this place will no longer be called Topheth and the Valley of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter."
Jeremiah,19,7,"I will spoil the plans of Judah and Jerusalem in this place. I will make them fall by the sword before their enemies, by the hand of those who want to take their life. I will provide their corpses as food for the birds of the sky and for the wild animals of the land."
Jeremiah,19,8,"I will make this city desolate, an object of scorn. Everyone who passes by it will be horrified and scoff because of all its wounds."
Jeremiah,19,9,"I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and their daughters, and they will eat each other’s flesh in the siege and distress that their enemies, those who want to take their life, inflict on them."
Jeremiah,19,10,"“Then you are to shatter the jar in the presence of the people traveling with you,"
Jeremiah,19,11,"and you are to proclaim to them: This is what the LORD of Hosts says: I will shatter these people and this city, like one shatters a potter’s jar that can never again be mended. They will bury the dead in Topheth because there is no other place for burials."
Jeremiah,19,12,"I will do so to this place”—this is the declaration of the LORD—“and to its residents, making this city like Topheth."
Jeremiah,19,13,The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will become impure like that place Topheth—all the houses on whose rooftops they have burned incense to the whole heavenly host and poured out drink offerings to other gods.”
Jeremiah,19,14,"Jeremiah came back from Topheth, where the LORD had sent him to prophesy, stood in the courtyard of the LORD’s temple, and proclaimed to all the people,"
Jeremiah,19,15,"“This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘I am about to bring on this city—and on all its dependent villages—all the disaster that I spoke against it, for they have become obstinate, not obeying My words.’”"
Jeremiah,20,1,"Pashhur the priest, the son of Immer and chief official in the temple of the LORD, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things."
Jeremiah,20,2,So Pashhur had Jeremiah the prophet beaten and put him in the stocks at the Upper Benjamin Gate in the LORD’s temple.
Jeremiah,20,3,"The next day, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, “The LORD does not call you Pashhur, but Magor-missabib,"
Jeremiah,20,4,"for this is what the LORD says, ‘I am about to make you a terror to both yourself and those you love. They will fall by the sword of their enemies before your very eyes. I will hand Judah over to the king of Babylon, and he will deport them to Babylon and put them to the sword."
Jeremiah,20,5,"I will give away all the wealth of this city, all its products and valuables. Indeed, I will hand all the treasures of the kings of Judah over to their enemies. They will plunder them, seize them, and carry them off to Babylon."
Jeremiah,20,6,"As for you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house, you will go into captivity. You will go to Babylon. There you will die, and there you will be buried, you and all your friends that you prophesied falsely to.’”"
Jeremiah,20,7,"You deceived me, LORD, and I was deceived. You seized me and prevailed. I am a laughingstock all the time; everyone ridicules me."
Jeremiah,20,8,"For whenever I speak, I cry out, I proclaim, “Violence and destruction!” because the word of the LORD has become for me constant disgrace and derision."
Jeremiah,20,9,"If I say, “I won’t mention Him or speak any longer in His name,” His message becomes a fire burning in my heart, shut up in my bones. I become tired of holding it in, and I cannot prevail."
Jeremiah,20,10,"For I have heard the gossip of many people, “Terror is on every side! Report him; let’s report him!” Everyone I trusted watches for my fall. “Perhaps he will be deceived so that we might prevail against him and take our vengeance on him.”"
Jeremiah,20,11,"But the LORD is with me like a violent warrior. Therefore, my persecutors will stumble and not prevail. Since they have not succeeded, they will be utterly shamed, an everlasting humiliation that will never be forgotten."
Jeremiah,20,12,"LORD of Hosts, testing the righteous and seeing the heart and mind, let me see Your vengeance on them, for I have presented my case to You."
Jeremiah,20,13,"Sing to the LORD! Praise the LORD, for He rescues the life of the needy from the hand of evil people."
Jeremiah,20,14,May the day I was born be cursed. May the day my mother bore me never be blessed.
Jeremiah,20,15,"May the man be cursed who brought the news to my father, saying, “A male child is born to you,” bringing him great joy."
Jeremiah,20,16,Let that man be like the cities the LORD demolished without compassion. Let him hear an outcry in the morning and a war cry at noontime
Jeremiah,20,17,"because he didn’t kill me in the womb so that my mother might have been my grave, her womb eternally pregnant."
Jeremiah,20,18,"Why did I come out of the womb to see only struggle and sorrow, to end my life in shame?"
Jeremiah,21,1,"This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD when King Zedekiah sent Pashhur son of Malchijah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to Jeremiah, asking,"
Jeremiah,21,2,"“Ask the LORD on our behalf, since Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is making war against us. Perhaps the LORD will perform for us something like all His past wonderful works so that Nebuchadnezzar will withdraw from us.”"
Jeremiah,21,3,"But Jeremiah answered, “This is what you are to say to Zedekiah:"
Jeremiah,21,4,"‘This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I will repel the weapons of war in your hands, those you are using to fight the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the wall, and I will bring them into the center of this city."
Jeremiah,21,5,"I will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm, with anger, rage, and great wrath."
Jeremiah,21,6,"I will strike the residents of this city, both man and beast. They will die in a great plague."
Jeremiah,21,7,"Afterward’”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“‘King Zedekiah of Judah, his officers, and the people—those in this city who survive the plague, the sword, and the famine—I will hand over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, to their enemies, yes, to those who want to take their lives. He will put them to the sword; he won’t spare them or show pity or compassion.’"
Jeremiah,21,8,"“But you must say to this people, ‘This is what the LORD says: Look, I am presenting to you the way of life and the way of death."
Jeremiah,21,9,"Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine, and plague, but whoever goes out and surrenders to the Chaldeans who are besieging you will live and will retain his life like the spoils of war."
Jeremiah,21,10,"For I have turned against this city to bring disaster and not good’”—this is the LORD’s declaration. “‘It will be handed over to the king of Babylon, who will burn it down.’"
Jeremiah,21,11,“And to the house of the king of Judah say this: ‘Hear the word of the LORD!
Jeremiah,21,12,"House of David, this is what the LORD says: Administer justice every morning, and rescue the victim of robbery from the hand of his oppressor, or My anger will flare up like fire and burn unquenchably because of their evil deeds."
Jeremiah,21,13,"Beware! I am against you, you who sit above the valley, you atop the rocky plateau— this is the LORD’s declaration— you who say, “Who can come down against us? Who can enter our hiding places?”"
Jeremiah,21,14,I will punish you according to what you have done— this is the LORD’s declaration. I will kindle a fire in its forest that will consume everything around it.’”
Jeremiah,22,1,This is what the LORD says: “Go down to the palace of the king of Judah and announce this word there.
Jeremiah,22,2,"You are to say: Hear the word of the LORD, king of Judah, you who sit on the throne of David—you, your officers, and your people who enter these gates."
Jeremiah,22,3,"This is what the LORD says: Administer justice and righteousness. Rescue the victim of robbery from the hand of his oppressor. Don’t exploit or brutalize the foreigner, the fatherless, or the widow. Don’t shed innocent blood in this place."
Jeremiah,22,4,"For if you conscientiously carry out this word, then kings sitting on David’s throne will enter through the gates of this palace riding on chariots and horses—they, their officers, and their people."
Jeremiah,22,5,"But if you do not obey these words, then I swear by Myself”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“that this house will become a ruin.”"
Jeremiah,22,6,"For this is what the LORD says concerning the house of the king of Judah: You are like Gilead to Me, or the summit of Lebanon, but I will certainly turn you into a wilderness, uninhabited cities."
Jeremiah,22,7,"I will appoint destroyers against you, each with his weapons. They will cut down the choicest of your cedars and throw them into the fire."
Jeremiah,22,8,"“Many nations will pass by this city and ask one another, ‘Why did the LORD do such a thing to this great city?’"
Jeremiah,22,9,"They will answer, ‘Because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh their God and worshiped and served other gods.’”"
Jeremiah,22,10,"Do not weep for the dead; do not mourn for him. Weep bitterly for the one who has gone away, for he will never return again and see his native land."
Jeremiah,22,11,"For this is what the LORD says concerning Shallum son of Josiah, king of Judah, who became king in place of his father Josiah: “He has left this place—he will never return here again,"
Jeremiah,22,12,"but he will die in the place where they deported him, never seeing this land again.”"
Jeremiah,22,13,"Woe for the one who builds his palace through unrighteousness, his upper rooms through injustice, who makes his fellow man serve without pay and will not give him his wages,"
Jeremiah,22,14,"who says, “I will build myself a massive palace, with spacious upper rooms.” He will cut windows in it, and it will be paneled with cedar and painted with vermilion."
Jeremiah,22,15,Are you a king because you excel in cedar? Didn’t your father eat and drink and administer justice and righteousness? Then it went well with him.
Jeremiah,22,16,"He took up the case of the poor and needy, then it went well. Is this not what it means to know Me? This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,22,17,"But you have eyes and a heart for nothing except your own dishonest profit, shedding innocent blood and committing extortion and oppression."
Jeremiah,22,18,"Therefore, this is what the LORD says concerning Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah: They will not mourn for him, saying, “Woe, my brother!” or “Woe, my sister!” They will not mourn for him, saying, “Woe, lord! Woe, his majesty!”"
Jeremiah,22,19,"He will be buried like a donkey, dragged off and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,22,20,"Go up to Lebanon and cry out; raise your voice in Bashan; cry out from Abarim, for all your lovers have been crushed."
Jeremiah,22,21,"I spoke to you when you were secure. You said, “I will not listen.” This has been your way since youth; indeed, you have never listened to Me."
Jeremiah,22,22,"The wind will take charge of all your shepherds, and your lovers will go into captivity. Then you will be ashamed and humiliated because of all your evil."
Jeremiah,22,23,"You residents of Lebanon, nestled among the cedars, how you will groan when labor pains come on you, agony like a woman in labor."
Jeremiah,22,24,"“As I live,” says the LORD, “though you, Coniah son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, were a signet ring on My right hand, I would tear you from it."
Jeremiah,22,25,"In fact, I will hand you over to those you dread, who want to take your life, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and the Chaldeans."
Jeremiah,22,26,"I will hurl you and the mother who gave birth to you into another land, where neither of you were born, and there you will both die."
Jeremiah,22,27,They will never return to the land they long to return to.”
Jeremiah,22,28,"Is this man Coniah a despised, shattered pot, a jar no one wants? Why are he and his descendants hurled out and cast into a land they have not known?"
Jeremiah,22,29,"Earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD!"
Jeremiah,22,30,"This is what the LORD says: Record this man as childless, a man who will not be successful in his lifetime. None of his descendants will succeed in sitting on the throne of David or ruling again in Judah."
Jeremiah,23,1,“Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of My pasture!” This is the LORD’s declaration.
Jeremiah,23,2,"“Therefore, this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says about the shepherds who shepherd My people: You have scattered My flock, banished them, and have not attended to them. I will attend to you because of your evil acts”—this is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,23,3,"“I will gather the remnant of My flock from all the lands where I have banished them, and I will return them to their grazing land. They will become fruitful and numerous."
Jeremiah,23,4,"I will raise up shepherds over them who will shepherd them. They will no longer be afraid or dismayed, nor will any be missing.” This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,23,5,“The days are coming”—this is the LORD’s declaration— “when I will raise up a Righteous Branch of David. He will reign wisely as king and administer justice and righteousness in the land.
Jeremiah,23,6,"In His days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. This is what He will be named: Yahweh Our Righteousness."
Jeremiah,23,7,"“The days are coming”—the LORD’s declaration—“when it will no longer be said, ‘As the LORD lives who brought the Israelites from the land of Egypt,’"
Jeremiah,23,8,"but, ‘As the LORD lives, who brought and led the descendants of the house of Israel from the land of the north and from all the other countries where I had banished them.’ They will dwell once more in their own land.”"
Jeremiah,23,9,"Concerning the prophets: My heart is broken within me, and all my bones tremble. I have become like a drunkard, like a man overcome by wine, because of the LORD, because of His holy words."
Jeremiah,23,10,"For the land is full of adulterers; the land mourns because of the curse, and the grazing lands in the wilderness have dried up. Their way of life has become evil, and their power is not rightly used"
Jeremiah,23,11,"because both prophet and priest are ungodly, even in My house I have found their evil. This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,23,12,"Therefore, their way will be to them like slippery paths in the gloom. They will be driven away and fall down there, for I will bring disaster on them, the year of their punishment. This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,23,13,Among the prophets of Samaria I saw something disgusting: They prophesied by Baal and led My people Israel astray.
Jeremiah,23,14,"Among the prophets of Jerusalem also I saw a horrible thing: They commit adultery and walk in lies. They strengthen the hands of evildoers, and none turns his back on evil. They are all like Sodom to Me; Jerusalem’s residents are like Gomorrah."
Jeremiah,23,15,"Therefore, this is what the LORD of Hosts says concerning the prophets: I am about to feed them wormwood and give them poisoned water to drink, for from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has spread throughout the land."
Jeremiah,23,16,"This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. They are making you worthless. They speak visions from their own minds, not from the LORD’s mouth."
Jeremiah,23,17,"They keep on saying to those who despise Me, ‘The LORD has said: You will have peace.’ They have said to everyone who follows the stubbornness of his heart, ‘No harm will come to you.’”"
Jeremiah,23,18,For who has stood in the council of the LORD to see and hear His word? Who has paid attention to His word and obeyed?
Jeremiah,23,19,"Look, a storm from the LORD! Wrath has gone out, a whirling storm. It will whirl about the heads of the wicked."
Jeremiah,23,20,The LORD’s anger will not turn back until He has completely fulfilled the purposes of His heart. In time to come you will understand it clearly.
Jeremiah,23,21,"I did not send these prophets, yet they ran with a message. I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied."
Jeremiah,23,22,"If they had really stood in My council, they would have enabled My people to hear My words and would have turned them back from their evil ways and their evil deeds."
Jeremiah,23,23,“Am I a God who is only near”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“and not a God who is far away?
Jeremiah,23,24,Can a man hide himself in secret places where I cannot see him?”—the LORD’s declaration. “Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?”—the LORD’s declaration.
Jeremiah,23,25,"“I have heard what the prophets who prophesy a lie in My name have said, ‘I had a dream! I had a dream!’"
Jeremiah,23,26,"How long will this continue in the minds of the prophets prophesying lies, prophets of the deceit of their own minds?"
Jeremiah,23,27,"Through their dreams that they tell one another, they plan to cause My people to forget My name as their fathers forgot My name through Baal worship."
Jeremiah,23,28,"The prophet who has only a dream should recount the dream, but the one who has My word should speak My word truthfully, for what is straw compared to grain?”—this is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,23,29,“Is not My word like fire”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“and like a hammer that pulverizes rock?
Jeremiah,23,30,"Therefore, take note! I am against the prophets”—the LORD’s declaration—“who steal My words from each other."
Jeremiah,23,31,I am against the prophets”—the LORD’s declaration—“who use their own tongues to make a declaration.
Jeremiah,23,32,"I am against those who prophesy false dreams”—the LORD’s declaration—“telling them and leading My people astray with their falsehoods and their boasting. It was not I who sent or commanded them, and they are of no benefit at all to these people”—this is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,23,33,"“Now when these people or a prophet or a priest asks you, ‘What is the burden of the LORD?’ you will respond to them: What is the burden? I will throw you away”—this is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,23,34,"“As for the prophet, priest, or people who say, ‘The burden of the LORD,’ I will punish that man and his household."
Jeremiah,23,35,"This is what each man is to say to his friend and to his brother, ‘What has the LORD answered?’ or ‘What has the LORD spoken?’"
Jeremiah,23,36,"But no longer refer to the burden of the LORD, for each man’s word becomes his burden and you pervert the words of the living God, the LORD of Hosts, our God."
Jeremiah,23,37,You must say to the prophet: What has the LORD answered you? and What has the LORD spoken?
Jeremiah,23,38,"But if you say, ‘The burden of the LORD,’ then this is what the LORD says: Because you have said, ‘The burden of the LORD,’ and I specifically told you not to say, ‘The burden of the LORD,’"
Jeremiah,23,39,I will surely forget you and throw away from My presence both you and the city that I gave you and your fathers.
Jeremiah,23,40,I will bring on you everlasting shame and humiliation that will never be forgotten.”
Jeremiah,24,1,"After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had deported Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, the officials of Judah, and the craftsmen and metalsmiths from Jerusalem and had brought them to Babylon, the LORD showed me two baskets of figs placed before the temple of the LORD."
Jeremiah,24,2,"One basket contained very good figs, like early figs, but the other basket contained very bad figs, so bad they were inedible."
Jeremiah,24,3,"The LORD said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” I said, “Figs! The good figs are very good, but the bad figs are extremely bad, so bad they are inedible.”"
Jeremiah,24,4,The word of the LORD came to me:
Jeremiah,24,5,"“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Like these good figs, so I regard as good the exiles from Judah I sent away from this place to the land of the Chaldeans."
Jeremiah,24,6,I will keep My eyes on them for their good and will return them to this land. I will build them up and not demolish them; I will plant them and not uproot them.
Jeremiah,24,7,"I will give them a heart to know Me, that I am Yahweh. They will be My people, and I will be their God because they will return to Me with all their heart."
Jeremiah,24,8,"“But as for the bad figs, so bad they are inedible, this is what the LORD says: in this way I will deal with king Zedekiah of Judah, his officials, and the remnant of Jerusalem—those remaining in this land and those living in the land of Egypt."
Jeremiah,24,9,"I will make them an object of horror and disaster to all the kingdoms of the earth, a disgrace, an object of scorn, ridicule, and cursing, wherever I have banished them."
Jeremiah,24,10,"I will send the sword, famine, and plague against them until they have perished from the land I gave to them and their ancestors.”"
Jeremiah,25,1,"This is the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah (which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon)."
Jeremiah,25,2,The prophet Jeremiah spoke concerning all the people of Judah and all the residents of Jerusalem as follows:
Jeremiah,25,3,"“From the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah, until this very day—23 years—the word of the LORD has come to me, and I have spoken to you time and time again, but you have not obeyed."
Jeremiah,25,4,"The LORD sent all His servants the prophets to you time and time again, but you have not obeyed or even paid attention."
Jeremiah,25,5,"He announced, ‘Turn, each of you, from your evil way of life and from your evil deeds. Live in the land the LORD gave to you and your ancestors long ago and forever."
Jeremiah,25,6,"Do not follow other gods to serve them and to worship them, and do not provoke Me to anger by the work of your hands. Then I will do you no harm."
Jeremiah,25,7,“‘But you would not obey Me’—this is the LORD’s declaration—‘in order that you might provoke Me to anger by the work of your hands and bring disaster on yourselves.’
Jeremiah,25,8,"“Therefore, this is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘Because you have not obeyed My words,"
Jeremiah,25,9,"I am going to send for all the families of the north’—this is the LORD’s declaration—‘and send for My servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and I will bring them against this land, against its residents, and against all these surrounding nations, and I will completely destroy them and make them a desolation, a derision, and ruins forever."
Jeremiah,25,10,"I will eliminate the sound of joy and gladness from them—the voice of the groom and the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp."
Jeremiah,25,11,"This whole land will become a desolate ruin, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon for 70 years."
Jeremiah,25,12,"When the 70 years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation’—this is the LORD’s declaration—‘the land of the Chaldeans, for their guilt, and I will make it a ruin forever."
Jeremiah,25,13,"I will bring on that land all My words I have spoken against it, all that is written in this book that Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations."
Jeremiah,25,14,"For many nations and great kings will enslave them, and I will repay them according to their deeds and the work of their hands.’”"
Jeremiah,25,15,"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, said to me: “Take this cup of the wine of wrath from My hand and make all the nations I am sending you to, drink from it."
Jeremiah,25,16,"They will drink, stagger, and go out of their minds because of the sword I am sending among them.”"
Jeremiah,25,17,"So I took the cup from the LORD’s hand and made all the nations drink from it, everyone the LORD sent me to."
Jeremiah,25,18,"These included: Jerusalem and the other cities of Judah, its kings and its officials, to make them a desolate ruin, an object of scorn and cursing—as it is today;"
Jeremiah,25,19,"Pharaoh king of Egypt, his officers, his leaders, all his people,"
Jeremiah,25,20,"and all the mixed peoples; all the kings of the land of Uz; all the kings of the land of the Philistines—Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;"
Jeremiah,25,21,"Edom, Moab, and the Ammonites;"
Jeremiah,25,22,"all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the coastlands across the sea;"
Jeremiah,25,23,"Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all those who shave their temples;"
Jeremiah,25,24,"all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mixed peoples who have settled in the desert;"
Jeremiah,25,25,"all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media;"
Jeremiah,25,26,"all the kings of the north, both near and far from one another; that is, all the kingdoms of the world which are on the face of the earth. Finally, the king of Sheshach will drink after them."
Jeremiah,25,27,"“Then you are to say to them: This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Drink, get drunk, and vomit. Fall down and never get up again, as a result of the sword I am sending among you."
Jeremiah,25,28,"If they refuse to take the cup from you and drink, you are to say to them: This is what the LORD of Hosts says: You must drink!"
Jeremiah,25,29,"For I am already bringing disaster on the city that bears My name, so how could you possibly go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth”—this is the declaration of the LORD of Hosts."
Jeremiah,25,30,"“As for you, you are to prophesy all these things to them, and say to them: The LORD roars from heaven; He raises His voice from His holy dwelling. He roars loudly over His grazing land; He calls out with a shout, like those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth."
Jeremiah,25,31,"The tumult reaches to the ends of the earth because the LORD brings a case against the nations. He enters into judgment with all flesh. As for the wicked, He hands them over to the sword— this is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,25,32,“This is what the LORD of Hosts says: Pay attention! Disaster spreads from nation to nation. A great storm is stirred up from the ends of the earth.”
Jeremiah,25,33,"Those slain by the LORD on that day will be spread from one end of the earth to the other. They will not be mourned, gathered, or buried. They will be like manure on the surface of the ground."
Jeremiah,25,34,"Wail, you shepherds, and cry out. Roll in the dust, you leaders of the flock. Because the days of your slaughter have come, you will fall and become shattered like a precious vase."
Jeremiah,25,35,"Flight will be impossible for the shepherds, and escape, for the leaders of the flock."
Jeremiah,25,36,"Hear the sound of the shepherds’ cry, the wail of the leaders of the flock, for the LORD is destroying their pasture."
Jeremiah,25,37,Peaceful grazing land will become lifeless because of the LORD’s burning anger.
Jeremiah,25,38,"He has left His den like a lion, for their land has become a desolation because of the sword of the oppressor, because of His burning anger."
Jeremiah,26,1,"At the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from the LORD:"
Jeremiah,26,2,“This is what the LORD says: Stand in the courtyard of the LORD’s temple and speak all the words I have commanded you to speak to all Judah’s cities that are coming to worship there. Do not hold back a word.
Jeremiah,26,3,Perhaps they will listen and return—each from his evil way of life—so that I might relent concerning the disaster that I plan to do to them because of the evil of their deeds.
Jeremiah,26,4,You are to say to them: This is what the LORD says: If you do not listen to Me by living according to My instruction that I set before you
Jeremiah,26,5,"and by listening to the words of My servants the prophets I have been sending you time and time again, though you did not listen,"
Jeremiah,26,6,I will make this temple like Shiloh. I will make this city an object of cursing for all the nations of the earth.”
Jeremiah,26,7,"The priests, the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the temple of the LORD."
Jeremiah,26,8,"He finished the address the LORD had commanded him to deliver to all the people. Then the priests, the prophets, and all the people took hold of him, yelling, “You must surely die!"
Jeremiah,26,9,"How dare you prophesy in the name of Yahweh, ‘This temple will become like Shiloh and this city will become an uninhabited ruin’!” Then all the people assembled against Jeremiah at the LORD’s temple."
Jeremiah,26,10,"When the officials of Judah heard these things, they went from the king’s palace to the LORD’s temple and sat at the entrance of the New Gate."
Jeremiah,26,11,"Then the priests and prophets said to the officials and all the people, “This man deserves the death sentence because he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your own ears.”"
Jeremiah,26,12,"Then Jeremiah said to all the officials and the people, “The LORD sent me to prophesy all the words that you have heard against this temple and city."
Jeremiah,26,13,"So now, correct your ways and deeds and obey the voice of the LORD your God so that He might relent concerning the disaster that He warned about."
Jeremiah,26,14,"As for me, here I am in your hands; do to me what you think is good and right."
Jeremiah,26,15,"But know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood on yourselves, on this city, and on its residents, for it is certain the LORD has sent me to speak all these things directly to you.”"
Jeremiah,26,16,"Then the officials and all the people told the priests and prophets, “This man doesn’t deserve the death sentence, for he has spoken to us in the name of Yahweh our God!”"
Jeremiah,26,17,"Some of the elders of the land stood up and said to all the assembled people,"
Jeremiah,26,18,"“Micah the Moreshite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah and said to all the people of Judah, ‘This is what the LORD of Hosts says: Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become ruins, and the temple mount a forested hill.’"
Jeremiah,26,19,"Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all the people of Judah put him to death? Did he not fear the LORD and plead for the LORD’s favor, and did not the LORD relent concerning the disaster He had pronounced against them? We are about to bring great harm on ourselves!”"
Jeremiah,26,20,Another man was also prophesying in the name of Yahweh—Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim. He prophesied against this city and against this land in words like all those of Jeremiah.
Jeremiah,26,21,"King Jehoiakim, all his warriors, and all the officials heard his words, and the king tried to put him to death. When Uriah heard, he fled in fear and went to Egypt."
Jeremiah,26,22,But King Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt: Elnathan son of Achbor and certain other men with him went to Egypt.
Jeremiah,26,23,"They brought Uriah out of Egypt and took him to King Jehoiakim, who executed him with the sword and threw his corpse into the burial place of the common people."
Jeremiah,26,24,"But Ahikam son of Shaphan supported Jeremiah, so he was not handed over to the people to be put to death."
Jeremiah,27,1,"At the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD:"
Jeremiah,27,2,“This is what the LORD said to me: Make chains and yoke bars for yourself and put them on your neck.
Jeremiah,27,3,"Send word to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the Ammonites, the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon through messengers who are coming to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,27,4,"Command them to go to their masters, saying: This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: This is what you must say to your masters:"
Jeremiah,27,5,"By My great strength and outstretched arm, I made the earth, and the people, and animals on the face of the earth. I give it to anyone I please."
Jeremiah,27,6,"So now I have placed all these lands under the authority of My servant Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. I have even given him the wild animals to serve him."
Jeremiah,27,7,"All nations will serve him, his son, and his grandson until the time for his own land comes, and then many nations and great kings will enslave him."
Jeremiah,27,8,"“As for the nation or kingdom that does not serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and does not place its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation I will punish by sword, famine, and plague”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“until through him I have destroyed it."
Jeremiah,27,9,"But as for you, do not listen to your prophets, diviners, dreamers, fortune-tellers, or sorcerers who say to you, ‘Don’t serve the king of Babylon!’"
Jeremiah,27,10,"for they prophesy a lie to you so that you will be removed from your land. I will banish you, and you will perish."
Jeremiah,27,11,"But as for the nation that will put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will leave it in its own land, and that nation will cultivate it and reside in it.” This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,27,12,"I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah in the same way: “Put your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, serve him and his people, and live!"
Jeremiah,27,13,"Why should you and your people die by the sword, famine, or plague as the LORD has threatened against any nation that does not serve the king of Babylon?"
Jeremiah,27,14,"Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are telling you, ‘You must not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they are prophesying a lie to you."
Jeremiah,27,15,"‘I have not sent them’—this is the LORD’s declaration—‘and they are prophesying falsely in My name; therefore, I will banish you, and you will perish—you and the prophets who are prophesying to you.’”"
Jeremiah,27,16,"Then I spoke to the priests and all these people, saying, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Do not listen to the words of your prophets. They are prophesying to you, claiming, “Look, very soon now the articles of the LORD’s temple will be brought back from Babylon.” They are prophesying a lie to you."
Jeremiah,27,17,Do not listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon and live! Why should this city become a ruin?
Jeremiah,27,18,"If they are indeed prophets and if the word of the LORD is with them, let them intercede with the LORD of Hosts not to let the articles that remain in the LORD’s temple, in the palace of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem go to Babylon.’"
Jeremiah,27,19,"For this is what the LORD of Hosts says about the pillars, the sea, the water carts, and the rest of the articles that still remain in this city,"
Jeremiah,27,20,"those Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he deported Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,27,21,"Yes, this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says about the articles that remain in the temple of the LORD, in the palace of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem:"
Jeremiah,27,22,‘They will be brought to Babylon and will remain there until I attend to them again.’ This is the LORD’s declaration. ‘Then I will bring them up and restore them to this place.’”
Jeremiah,28,1,"In that same year, at the beginning of the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah, in the fifth month of the fourth year, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur from Gibeon said to me in the temple of the LORD in the presence of the priests and all the people,"
Jeremiah,28,2,"“This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,28,3,Within two years I will restore to this place all the articles of the LORD’s temple that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon took from here and transported to Babylon.
Jeremiah,28,4,"And I will restore to this place Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the exiles from Judah who went to Babylon’—this is the LORD’s declaration—‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’”"
Jeremiah,28,5,The prophet Jeremiah replied to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the temple of the LORD.
Jeremiah,28,6,"The prophet Jeremiah said, “Amen! May the LORD do so. May the LORD make the words you have prophesied come true and may He restore the articles of the LORD’s temple and all the exiles from Babylon to this place!"
Jeremiah,28,7,Only listen to this message I am speaking in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people.
Jeremiah,28,8,"The prophets who preceded you and me from ancient times prophesied war, disaster, and plague against many lands and great kingdoms."
Jeremiah,28,9,As for the prophet who prophesies peace—only when the word of the prophet comes true will the prophet be recognized as one the LORD has truly sent.”
Jeremiah,28,10,The prophet Hananiah then took the yoke bar from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it.
Jeremiah,28,11,"In the presence of all the people Hananiah proclaimed, “This is what the LORD says: ‘In this way, within two years I will break the yoke of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon from the neck of all the nations.’” Jeremiah the prophet then went on his way."
Jeremiah,28,12,The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke bar from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet:
Jeremiah,28,13,"“Go say to Hananiah: This is what the LORD says, ‘You broke a wooden yoke bar, but in its place you will make an iron yoke bar.’"
Jeremiah,28,14,"For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, ‘I have put an iron yoke on the neck of all these nations that they might serve King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, and they will serve him. I have also put the wild animals under him.’”"
Jeremiah,28,15,"The prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah, “Listen, Hananiah! The LORD did not send you, but you have led these people to trust in a lie."
Jeremiah,28,16,"Therefore, this is what the LORD says: ‘I am about to send you off the face of the earth. You will die this year because you have spoken rebellion against the LORD.’”"
Jeremiah,28,17,And the prophet Hananiah died that year in the seventh month.
Jeremiah,29,1,"This is the text of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the rest of the elders of the exiles, the priests, the prophets, and all the people Nebuchadnezzar had deported from Jerusalem to Babylon."
Jeremiah,29,2,"This was after King Jeconiah, the queen mother, the court officials, the officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the metalsmiths had left Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,29,3,The letter was sent by Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah whom Zedekiah king of Judah had sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. The letter stated:
Jeremiah,29,4,"This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says to all the exiles I deported from Jerusalem to Babylon:"
Jeremiah,29,5,“Build houses and live in them. Plant gardens and eat their produce.
Jeremiah,29,6,Take wives and have sons and daughters. Take wives for your sons and give your daughters to men in marriage so that they may bear sons and daughters. Multiply there; do not decrease.
Jeremiah,29,7,"Seek the welfare of the city I have deported you to. Pray to the LORD on its behalf, for when it has prosperity, you will prosper.”"
Jeremiah,29,8,"For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “Don’t let your prophets who are among you and your diviners deceive you, and don’t listen to the dreams you elicit from them,"
Jeremiah,29,9,for they are prophesying falsely to you in My name. I have not sent them.” This is the LORD’s declaration.
Jeremiah,29,10,"For this is what the LORD says: “When 70 years for Babylon are complete, I will attend to you and will confirm My promise concerning you to restore you to this place."
Jeremiah,29,11,"For I know the plans I have for you”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“plans for your welfare, not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope."
Jeremiah,29,12,"You will call to Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you."
Jeremiah,29,13,You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.
Jeremiah,29,14,I will be found by you”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and places where I banished you”—this is the LORD’s declaration. “I will restore you to the place I deported you from.”
Jeremiah,29,15,"You have said, “The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon!”"
Jeremiah,29,16,"But this is what the LORD says concerning the king sitting on David’s throne and concerning all the people living in this city—that is, concerning your brothers who did not go with you into exile."
Jeremiah,29,17,"This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “I am about to send against them sword, famine, and plague and will make them like rotten figs that are inedible because they are so bad."
Jeremiah,29,18,"I will pursue them with sword, famine, and plague. I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth—a curse and a desolation, an object of scorn and a disgrace among all the nations where I have banished them."
Jeremiah,29,19,I will do this because they have not listened to My words”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“that I sent to them with My servants the prophets time and time again. And you too have not listened.” This is the LORD’s declaration.
Jeremiah,29,20,"Hear the word of the LORD, all you exiles I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon."
Jeremiah,29,21,"This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says to Ahab son of Kolaiah and to Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, the ones prophesying a lie to you in My name: “I am about to hand them over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will kill them before your very eyes."
Jeremiah,29,22,"Based on what happens to them, all the exiles of Judah who are in Babylon will create a curse that says, ‘May the LORD make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire!’"
Jeremiah,29,23,"because they have committed an outrage in Israel by committing adultery with their neighbors’ wives and have spoken a lie in My name, which I did not command them. I am He who knows, and I am a witness.” This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,29,24,"To Shemaiah the Nehelamite you are to say,"
Jeremiah,29,25,"“This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: You in your own name have sent out letters to all the people of Jerusalem, to the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, and to all the priests, saying:"
Jeremiah,29,26,"‘The LORD has appointed you priest in place of Jehoiada the priest to be the chief officer in the temple of the LORD, responsible for every madman who acts like a prophet. You must confine him in the stocks and an iron collar."
Jeremiah,29,27,"So now, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who has been acting like a prophet among you?"
Jeremiah,29,28,"For he has sent word to us in Babylon, claiming, “The exile will be long. Build houses and settle down. Plant gardens and eat their produce.”’”"
Jeremiah,29,29,Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah,29,30,Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah,29,31,"“Send a message to all the exiles, saying: This is what the LORD says concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite. Because Shemaiah prophesied to you, though I did not send him, and made you trust a lie,"
Jeremiah,29,32,"this is what the LORD says: I am about to punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants. There will not be even one of his descendants living among these people, nor will any ever see the good that I will bring to My people”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“for he has preached rebellion against the LORD.”"
Jeremiah,30,1,This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD.
Jeremiah,30,2,"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: “Write down on a scroll all the words that I have spoken to you,"
Jeremiah,30,3,for the days are certainly coming”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“when I will restore the fortunes of My people Israel and Judah”—the LORD’s declaration. “I will restore them to the land I gave to their ancestors and they will possess it.”
Jeremiah,30,4,These are the words the LORD spoke to Israel and Judah.
Jeremiah,30,5,"Yes, this is what the LORD says: We have heard a cry of terror, of dread—there is no peace."
Jeremiah,30,6,Ask and see whether a male can give birth. Why then do I see every man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor and every face turned pale?
Jeremiah,30,7,"How awful that day will be! There will be none like it! It will be a time of trouble for Jacob, but he will be delivered out of it."
Jeremiah,30,8,“On that day”—this is the declaration of the LORD of Hosts—“I will break his yoke from your neck and tear off your chains so strangers will never again enslave him.
Jeremiah,30,9,They will serve the LORD their God and I will raise up David their king for them.”
Jeremiah,30,10,"As for you, My servant Jacob, do not be afraid— this is the LORD’s declaration— and do not be dismayed, Israel, for without fail I will save you from far away, your descendants, from the land of their captivity! Jacob will return and have calm and quiet with no one to frighten him."
Jeremiah,30,11,"For I will be with you— this is the LORD’s declaration— to save you! I will bring destruction on all the nations where I have scattered you; however, I will not bring destruction on you. I will discipline you justly, and I will by no means leave you unpunished."
Jeremiah,30,12,For this is what the LORD says: Your injury is incurable; your wound most severe.
Jeremiah,30,13,No one takes up the case for your sores. There is no healing for you.
Jeremiah,30,14,"All your lovers have forgotten you; they no longer look for you, for I have struck you as an enemy would, with the discipline of someone cruel, because of your enormous guilt and your innumerable sins."
Jeremiah,30,15,Why do you cry out about your injury? Your pain has no cure! I have done these things to you because of your enormous guilt and your innumerable sins.
Jeremiah,30,16,"Nevertheless, all who devoured you will be devoured, and all your adversaries—all of them— will go off into exile. Those who plunder you will be plundered, and all who raid you will be raided."
Jeremiah,30,17,"But I will bring you health and will heal you of your wounds— this is the LORD’s declaration— for they call you Outcast, Zion whom no one cares about."
Jeremiah,30,18,This is what the LORD says: I will certainly restore the fortunes of Jacob’s tents and show compassion on his dwellings. Every city will be rebuilt on its mound; every citadel will stand on its proper site.
Jeremiah,30,19,"Thanksgiving will come out of them, a sound of celebration. I will multiply them, and they will not decrease; I will honor them, and they will not be insignificant."
Jeremiah,30,20,His children will be as in past days; his congregation will be established in My presence. I will punish all his oppressors.
Jeremiah,30,21,"Jacob’s leader will be one of them; his ruler will issue from him. I will invite him to Me, and he will approach Me, for who would otherwise risk his life to approach Me? This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,30,22,"You will be My people, and I will be your God."
Jeremiah,30,23,"Look, a storm from the LORD! Wrath has gone out, a churning storm. It will whirl about the heads of the wicked."
Jeremiah,30,24,The LORD’s burning anger will not turn back until He has completely fulfilled the purposes of His heart. In time to come you will understand it.
Jeremiah,31,1,"“At that time”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they will be My people.”"
Jeremiah,31,2,"This is what the LORD says: They found favor in the wilderness— the people who survived the sword. When Israel went to find rest,"
Jeremiah,31,3,"the LORD appeared to him from far away. I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore, I have continued to extend faithful love to you."
Jeremiah,31,4,"Again I will build you so that you will be rebuilt, Virgin Israel. You will take up your tambourines again and go out in joyful dancing."
Jeremiah,31,5,You will plant vineyards again on the mountains of Samaria; the planters will plant and will enjoy the fruit.
Jeremiah,31,6,"For there will be a day when watchmen will call out in the hill country of Ephraim, “Get up, let’s go up to Zion, to Yahweh our God!”"
Jeremiah,31,7,"For this is what the LORD says: Sing with joy for Jacob; shout for the chief of the nations! Proclaim, praise, and say, “LORD, save Your people, the remnant of Israel!”"
Jeremiah,31,8,"Watch! I am going to bring them from the northern land. I will gather them from remote regions of the earth— the blind and the lame will be with them, along with those who are pregnant and those about to give birth. They will return here as a great assembly!"
Jeremiah,31,9,"They will come weeping, but I will bring them back with consolation. I will lead them to wadis filled with water by a smooth way where they will not stumble, for I am Israel’s Father, and Ephraim is My firstborn."
Jeremiah,31,10,"Nations, hear the word of the LORD, and tell it among the far off coastlands! Say: The One who scattered Israel will gather him. He will watch over him as a shepherd guards his flock,"
Jeremiah,31,11,for the LORD has ransomed Jacob and redeemed him from the power of one stronger than he.
Jeremiah,31,12,"They will come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion; they will be radiant with joy because of the LORD’s goodness, because of the grain, the new wine, the fresh oil, and because of the young of the flocks and herds. Their life will be like an irrigated garden, and they will no longer grow weak from hunger."
Jeremiah,31,13,"Then the young woman will rejoice with dancing, while young and old men rejoice together. I will turn their mourning into joy, give them consolation, and bring happiness out of grief."
Jeremiah,31,14,"I will refresh the priests with an abundance, and My people will be satisfied with My goodness. This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,31,15,"This is what the LORD says: A voice was heard in Ramah, a lament with bitter weeping— Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted for her children because they are no more."
Jeremiah,31,16,"This is what the LORD says: Keep your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears, for the reward for your work will come— this is the LORD’s declaration— and your children will return from the enemy’s land."
Jeremiah,31,17,There is hope for your future— this is the LORD’s declaration— and your children will return to their own territory.
Jeremiah,31,18,"I have heard Ephraim moaning, “You disciplined me, and I have been disciplined like an untrained calf. Restore me, and I will return, for you, LORD, are my God."
Jeremiah,31,19,"After I returned, I repented; After I was instructed, I struck my thigh in grief. I was ashamed and humiliated because I bore the disgrace of my youth.”"
Jeremiah,31,20,"Isn’t Ephraim a precious son to Me, a delightful child? Whenever I speak against him, I certainly still think about him. Therefore, My inner being yearns for him; I will truly have compassion on him. This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,31,21,"Set up road markers for yourself; establish signposts! Keep the highway in mind, the way you have traveled. Return, Virgin Israel! Return to these cities of yours."
Jeremiah,31,22,"How long will you turn here and there, faithless daughter? For the LORD creates something new in the land— a female will shelter a man."
Jeremiah,31,23,"This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “When I restore their fortunes, they will once again speak this word in the land of Judah and in its cities, ‘May the LORD bless you, righteous settlement, holy mountain.’"
Jeremiah,31,24,Judah and all its cities will live in it together—also farmers and those who move with the flocks—
Jeremiah,31,25,for I satisfy the thirsty person and feed all those who are weak.”
Jeremiah,31,26,At this I awoke and looked around. My sleep had been most pleasant to me.
Jeremiah,31,27,“The days are coming”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and the seed of beast.
Jeremiah,31,28,"Just as I watched over them to uproot and to tear them down, to demolish and to destroy, and to cause disaster, so will I be attentive to build and to plant them,” says the LORD."
Jeremiah,31,29,"“In those days, it will never again be said: The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge."
Jeremiah,31,30,"Rather, each will die for his own wrongdoing. Anyone who eats sour grapes—his own teeth will be set on edge."
Jeremiah,31,31,"“Look, the days are coming”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah."
Jeremiah,31,32,This one will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt—a covenant they broke even though I had married them”—the LORD’s declaration.
Jeremiah,31,33,"“Instead, this is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after those days”—the LORD’s declaration. “I will put My teaching within them and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be My people."
Jeremiah,31,34,"No longer will one teach his neighbor or his brother, saying, ‘Know the LORD,’ for they will all know Me, from the least to the greatest of them”—this is the LORD’s declaration. “For I will forgive their wrongdoing and never again remember their sin.”"
Jeremiah,31,35,"This is what the LORD says: The One who gives the sun for light by day, the fixed order of moon and stars for light by night, who stirs up the sea and makes its waves roar— Yahweh of Hosts is His name:"
Jeremiah,31,36,If this fixed order departs from My presence— this is the LORD’s declaration— then also Israel’s descendants will cease to be a nation before Me forever.
Jeremiah,31,37,"This is what the LORD says: If the heavens above can be measured and the foundations of the earth below explored, I will reject all of Israel’s descendants because of all they have done— this is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,31,38,"“Look, the days are coming”—the LORD’s declaration—“when the city from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate will be rebuilt for the LORD."
Jeremiah,31,39,A measuring line will once again stretch out straight to the hill of Gareb and then turn toward Goah.
Jeremiah,31,40,"The whole valley—the corpses, the ashes, and all the fields as far as the Kidron Valley to the corner of the Horse Gate to the east—will be holy to the LORD. It will never be uprooted or demolished again.”"
Jeremiah,32,1,"This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar."
Jeremiah,32,2,"At that time, the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was imprisoned in the guard’s courtyard in the palace of the king of Judah."
Jeremiah,32,3,"Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him, saying: “Why are you prophesying, ‘This is what the LORD says: Look, I am about to hand this city over to Babylon’s king, and he will capture it."
Jeremiah,32,4,"Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape from the Chaldeans; indeed, he will certainly be handed over to Babylon’s king. They will speak face to face and meet eye to eye."
Jeremiah,32,5,"He will take Zedekiah to Babylon where he will stay until I attend to him’—this is the LORD’s declaration. ‘You will fight the Chaldeans, but you will not succeed’?”"
Jeremiah,32,6,"Jeremiah replied, “The word of the LORD came to me:"
Jeremiah,32,7,"Watch! Hanamel, the son of your uncle Shallum, is coming to you to say, ‘Buy my field in Anathoth for yourself, for you own the right of redemption to buy it.’"
Jeremiah,32,8,"“Then my cousin Hanamel came to the guard’s courtyard as the LORD had said and urged me, ‘Please buy my field in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, for you own the right of inheritance and redemption. Buy it for yourself.’ Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD."
Jeremiah,32,9,"So I bought the field in Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel, and I weighed out to him the money—17 shekels of silver."
Jeremiah,32,10,"I recorded it on a scroll, sealed it, called in witnesses, and weighed out the silver in the scales."
Jeremiah,32,11,I took the purchase agreement—the sealed copy with its terms and conditions and the open copy—
Jeremiah,32,12,"and gave the purchase agreement to Baruch son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah. I did this in the sight of my cousin Hanamel, the witnesses who were signing the purchase agreement, and all the Judeans sitting in the guard’s courtyard."
Jeremiah,32,13,"“I instructed Baruch in their sight,"
Jeremiah,32,14,"‘This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Take these scrolls—this purchase agreement with the sealed copy and this open copy—and put them in an earthen storage jar so they will last a long time."
Jeremiah,32,15,"For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Houses, fields, and vineyards will again be bought in this land.’"
Jeremiah,32,16,"“After I had given the purchase agreement to Baruch, son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD:"
Jeremiah,32,17,"Oh, Lord GOD! You Yourself made the heavens and earth by Your great power and with Your outstretched arm. Nothing is too difficult for You!"
Jeremiah,32,18,"You show faithful love to thousands but lay the fathers’ sins on their sons’ laps after them, great and mighty God whose name is Yahweh of Hosts,"
Jeremiah,32,19,"the One great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are on all the ways of the sons of men in order to give to each person according to his ways and the result of his deeds."
Jeremiah,32,20,"You performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt and do so to this very day both in Israel and among mankind. You made a name for Yourself, as is the case today."
Jeremiah,32,21,"You brought Your people Israel out of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terror."
Jeremiah,32,22,"You gave them this land You swore to give to their ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey."
Jeremiah,32,23,"They entered and possessed it, but they did not obey Your voice or live according to Your instructions. They failed to perform all You commanded them to do, and so You have brought all this disaster on them."
Jeremiah,32,24,"Look! Siege ramps have come against the city to capture it, and the city, as a result of the sword, famine, and plague, has been handed over to the Chaldeans who are fighting against it. What You have spoken has happened. Look, You can see it!"
Jeremiah,32,25,"Yet You, Lord GOD, have said to me: Buy the field with silver and call in witnesses—even though the city has been handed over to the Chaldeans!”"
Jeremiah,32,26,Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah,32,27,"“Look, I am Yahweh, the God of all flesh. Is anything too difficult for Me?"
Jeremiah,32,28,"Therefore, this is what the LORD says: I am about to hand this city over to the Chaldeans, to Babylon’s king Nebuchadnezzar, and he will capture it."
Jeremiah,32,29,"The Chaldeans who are going to fight against this city will come, set this city on fire, and burn it along with the houses where incense has been burned to Baal on their rooftops and where drink offerings have been poured out to other gods to provoke Me to anger."
Jeremiah,32,30,"From their youth, the Israelites and Judeans have done nothing but what is evil in My sight! They have done nothing but provoke Me to anger by the work of their hands”—this is the LORD’s declaration—"
Jeremiah,32,31,"“for this city has caused My wrath and fury from the day it was built until now. I will therefore remove it from My presence,"
Jeremiah,32,32,"because of all the evil the Israelites and Judeans have done to provoke Me to anger—they, their kings, their officials, their priests, and their prophets, the men of Judah, and the residents of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,32,33,"They have turned their backs to Me and not their faces. Though I taught them time and time again, they do not listen and receive discipline."
Jeremiah,32,34,They have placed their detestable things in the house that is called by My name and have defiled it.
Jeremiah,32,35,They have built the high places of Baal in the Valley of Hinnom to make their sons and daughters pass through the fire to Molech—something I had not commanded them. I had never entertained the thought that they do this detestable act causing Judah to sin!
Jeremiah,32,36,"“Now therefore, this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to this city about which you said, ‘It has been handed over to Babylon’s king through sword, famine, and plague’:"
Jeremiah,32,37,"I am about to gather them from all the lands where I have banished them in My anger, rage and great wrath, and I will return them to this place and make them live in safety."
Jeremiah,32,38,"They will be My people, and I will be their God."
Jeremiah,32,39,"I will give them one heart and one way so that for their good and for the good of their descendants after them, they will fear Me always."
Jeremiah,32,40,"“I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will never turn away from doing good to them, and I will put fear of Me in their hearts so they will never again turn away from Me."
Jeremiah,32,41,"I will take delight in them to do what is good for them, and with all My heart and mind I will faithfully plant them in this land."
Jeremiah,32,42,"“For this is what the LORD says: Just as I have brought all this great disaster on these people, so am I about to bring on them all the good I am promising them."
Jeremiah,32,43,"Fields will be bought in this land about which you are saying, ‘It’s a desolation without man or beast; it has been handed over to the Chaldeans!’"
Jeremiah,32,44,"Fields will be purchased with silver, the transaction written on a scroll and sealed, and witnesses will be called on in the land of Benjamin, in the areas surrounding Jerusalem, and in Judah’s cities—the cities of the hill country, the cities of the Judean foothills, and the cities of the Negev—because I will restore their fortunes.” This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,33,1,"While he was still confined in the guard’s courtyard, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah a second time:"
Jeremiah,33,2,"“The LORD who made the earth, the LORD who forms it to establish it, Yahweh is His name, says this:"
Jeremiah,33,3,Call to Me and I will answer you and tell you great and incomprehensible things you do not know.
Jeremiah,33,4,"For this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says concerning the houses of this city and the palaces of Judah’s kings, the ones torn down for defense against the siege ramps and the sword:"
Jeremiah,33,5,The people coming to fight the Chaldeans will fill the houses with the corpses of their own men that I strike down in My wrath and rage. I have hidden My face from this city because of all their evil.
Jeremiah,33,6,Yet I will certainly bring health and healing to it and will indeed heal them. I will let them experience the abundance of peace and truth.
Jeremiah,33,7,I will restore the fortunes of Judah and of Israel and will rebuild them as in former times.
Jeremiah,33,8,"I will purify them from all the wrongs they have committed against Me, and I will forgive all the wrongs they have committed against Me, rebelling against Me."
Jeremiah,33,9,"This city will bear on My behalf a name of joy, praise, and glory before all the nations of the earth, who will hear of all the good I will do for them. They will tremble with awe because of all the good and all the peace I will bring about for them."
Jeremiah,33,10,"“This is what the LORD says: In this place, which you say is a ruin, without man or beast—that is, in Judah’s cities and Jerusalem’s streets that are a desolation without man, without inhabitant, and without beast—there will be heard again"
Jeremiah,33,11,"a sound of joy and gladness, the voice of the groom and the bride, and the voice of those saying, Praise the LORD of Hosts, for the LORD is good; His faithful love endures forever as they bring thank offerings to the temple of the LORD. For I will restore the fortunes of the land as in former times, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,33,12,“This is what the LORD of Hosts says: In this desolate place—without man or beast—and in all its cities there will once more be a grazing land where shepherds may rest flocks.
Jeremiah,33,13,"The flocks will again pass under the hands of the one who counts them in the cities of the hill country, the cities of the Judean foothills, the cities of the Negev, the land of Benjamin—the cities surrounding Jerusalem and Judah’s cities, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,33,14,"“Look, the days are coming”— this is the LORD’s declaration— “when I will fulfill the good promises that I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and the house of Judah."
Jeremiah,33,15,"In those days and at that time I will cause a Righteous Branch to sprout up for David, and He will administer justice and righteousness in the land."
Jeremiah,33,16,"In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell securely, and this is what she will be named: Yahweh Our Righteousness."
Jeremiah,33,17,“For this is what the LORD says: David will never fail to have a man sitting on the throne of the house of Israel.
Jeremiah,33,18,"The Levitical priests will never fail to have a man always before Me to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings, and to make sacrifices.”"
Jeremiah,33,19,The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah,33,20,"“This is what the LORD says: If you can break My covenant with the day and My covenant with the night so that day and night cease to come at their regular time,"
Jeremiah,33,21,"then also My covenant with My servant David may be broken so that he will not have a son reigning on his throne, and the Levitical priests will not be My ministers."
Jeremiah,33,22,"The hosts of heaven cannot be counted; the sand of the sea cannot be measured. So, too, I will make the descendants of My servant David and the Levites who minister to Me innumerable.”"
Jeremiah,33,23,The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah,33,24,"“Have you not noticed what these people have said? They say, ‘The LORD has rejected the two families He had chosen.’ My people are treated with contempt and no longer regarded as a nation among them."
Jeremiah,33,25,"This is what the LORD says: If I do not keep My covenant with the day and with the night and fail to establish the fixed order of heaven and earth,"
Jeremiah,33,26,"then I might also reject the seed of Jacob and of My servant David—not taking from his descendants rulers over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Instead, I will restore their fortunes and have compassion on them.”"
Jeremiah,34,1,"This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD when Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, all his army, all the earthly kingdoms under his control, and all other nations were fighting against Jerusalem and all its surrounding cities:"
Jeremiah,34,2,"“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Go, speak to Zedekiah, king of Judah, and tell him: This is what the LORD says: I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down."
Jeremiah,34,3,"As for you, you will not escape from his hand but are certain to be captured and handed over to him. You will meet the king of Babylon eye to eye and speak face to face; you will go to Babylon."
Jeremiah,34,4,"“Yet hear the LORD’s word, Zedekiah, king of Judah. This is what the LORD says concerning you: You will not die by the sword;"
Jeremiah,34,5,"you will die peacefully. There will be a burning ceremony for you just like the burning ceremonies for your fathers, the former kings who preceded you. ‘Our king is dead!’ will be the lament for you, for I have spoken this word.” This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,34,6,So Jeremiah the prophet related all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem
Jeremiah,34,7,"while the king of Babylon’s army was attacking Jerusalem and all of Judah’s remaining cities—against Lachish and Azekah, for they were the only ones left of Judah’s fortified cities."
Jeremiah,34,8,"This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD after King Zedekiah made a covenant with all the people who were in Jerusalem to proclaim freedom to them,"
Jeremiah,34,9,so each man would free his male and female Hebrew slaves and no one would enslave his Judean brother.
Jeremiah,34,10,All the officials and people who entered into covenant to free their male and female slaves—in order not to enslave them any longer—obeyed and freed them.
Jeremiah,34,11,"Afterward, however, they changed their minds and took back their male and female slaves they had freed and forced them to become slaves again."
Jeremiah,34,12,Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
Jeremiah,34,13,"“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the place of slavery, saying:"
Jeremiah,34,14,"At the end of seven years, each of you must free his Hebrew brother who sold himself to you. He may serve you six years, but then you must send him out free from you. But your ancestors did not obey Me or pay any attention."
Jeremiah,34,15,"Today you repented and did what pleased Me, each of you proclaiming freedom for his neighbor. You made a covenant before Me at the temple called by My name."
Jeremiah,34,16,"But you have changed your minds and profaned My name. Each has taken back his male and female slaves who had been freed to go wherever they wanted, and you have again subjugated them to be your slaves."
Jeremiah,34,17,"“Therefore, this is what the LORD says: You have not obeyed Me by proclaiming freedom, each man for his brother and for his neighbor. I hereby proclaim freedom for you”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“to the sword, to plague, and to famine! I will make you a horror to all the earth’s kingdoms."
Jeremiah,34,18,"As for those who disobeyed My covenant, not keeping the terms of the covenant they made before Me, I will treat them like the calf they cut in two in order to pass between its pieces."
Jeremiah,34,19,"The officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the court officials, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the pieces of the calf"
Jeremiah,34,20,"will be handed over to their enemies, to those who want to take their life. Their corpses will become food for the birds of the sky and for the wild animals of the land."
Jeremiah,34,21,"I will hand Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials over to their enemies, to those who want to take their lives, to the king of Babylon’s army that is withdrawing."
Jeremiah,34,22,"I am about to give the command”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“and I will bring them back to this city. They will fight against it, capture it, and burn it down. I will make Judah’s cities a desolation, without inhabitant.”"
Jeremiah,35,1,"This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah:"
Jeremiah,35,2,"“Go to the house of the Rechabites, speak to them, and bring them to one of the chambers of the temple of the LORD to offer them a drink of wine.”"
Jeremiah,35,3,"So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons—the entire house of the Rechabites—"
Jeremiah,35,4,"and I brought them into the temple of the LORD to a chamber occupied by the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, a man of God, who had a chamber near the officials’ chamber, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah son of Shallum the doorkeeper."
Jeremiah,35,5,"I set jars filled with wine and some cups before the sons of the house of the Rechabites and said to them, “Drink wine!”"
Jeremiah,35,6,"But they replied, “We do not drink wine, for Jonadab, son of our ancestor Rechab, commanded: ‘You and your sons must never drink wine."
Jeremiah,35,7,"You must not build a house or sow seed or plant a vineyard. Those things are not for you. Rather, you must live in tents your whole life, so you may live a long time on the soil where you stay as a temporary resident.’"
Jeremiah,35,8,"We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab, son of our ancestor Rechab, in all he commanded us. So we haven’t drunk wine our whole life—we, our wives, our sons, and our daughters."
Jeremiah,35,9,"We also have not built houses to live in and do not have vineyard, field, or seed."
Jeremiah,35,10,But we have lived in tents and have obeyed and done as our ancestor Jonadab commanded us.
Jeremiah,35,11,"However, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched into the land, we said: Come, let’s go into Jerusalem to get away from the Chaldean and Aramean armies. So we have been living in Jerusalem.”"
Jeremiah,35,12,Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah,35,13,"“This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Go, say to the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem: Will you not accept discipline by listening to My words?”—this is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,35,14,"“The words of Jonadab, son of Rechab, have been carried out. He commanded his sons not to drink wine, and they have not drunk to this very day because they have obeyed their ancestor’s command. But I have spoken to you time and time again, and you have not obeyed Me!"
Jeremiah,35,15,"Time and time again I have sent you all My servants the prophets, proclaiming: Turn, each one from his evil way of life, and correct your actions. Stop following other gods to serve them. Live in the land that I gave you and your ancestors. But you would not pay attention or obey Me."
Jeremiah,35,16,"Yes, the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab carried out their ancestor’s command he gave them, but these people have not obeyed Me."
Jeremiah,35,17,"Therefore, this is what the LORD, the God of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I will certainly bring to Judah and to all the residents of Jerusalem all the disaster I have pronounced against them because I have spoken to them, but they have not obeyed, and I have called to them, but they would not answer.”"
Jeremiah,35,18,"Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites: “This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Because you have obeyed the command of your ancestor Jonadab and have kept all his commands and have done all that he commanded you,"
Jeremiah,35,19,"this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Jonadab son of Rechab will never fail to have a man to always stand before Me.’”"
Jeremiah,36,1,"In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD:"
Jeremiah,36,2,"“Take a scroll, and write on it all the words I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah, and all the nations from the time I first spoke to you during Josiah’s reign until today."
Jeremiah,36,3,"Perhaps when the house of Judah hears about all the disaster I am planning to bring on them, each one of them will turn from his evil way. Then I will forgive their wrongdoing and their sin.”"
Jeremiah,36,4,"So Jeremiah summoned Baruch son of Neriah. At Jeremiah’s dictation, Baruch wrote on a scroll all the words the LORD had spoken to Jeremiah."
Jeremiah,36,5,"Then Jeremiah commanded Baruch, “I am restricted; I cannot enter the temple of the LORD,"
Jeremiah,36,6,so you must go and read from the scroll—which you wrote at my dictation—the words of the LORD in the hearing of the people at the temple of the LORD on a day of fasting. You must also read them in the hearing of all the Judeans who are coming from their cities.
Jeremiah,36,7,"Perhaps their petition will come before the LORD, and each one will turn from his evil way, for the anger and fury that the LORD has pronounced against this people are great.”"
Jeremiah,36,8,So Baruch son of Neriah did everything Jeremiah the prophet had commanded him. At the LORD’s temple he read the LORD’s words from the scroll.
Jeremiah,36,9,"In the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people of Jerusalem and all those coming in from Judah’s cities into Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the LORD."
Jeremiah,36,10,"Then at the LORD’s temple, in the chamber of Gemariah son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper courtyard at the opening of the New Gate of the LORD’s temple, in the hearing of all the people, Baruch read Jeremiah’s words from the scroll."
Jeremiah,36,11,"When Micaiah son of Gemariah, son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the scroll,"
Jeremiah,36,12,"he went down to the scribe’s chamber in the king’s palace. All the officials were sitting there—Elishama the scribe, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials."
Jeremiah,36,13,Micaiah reported to them all the words he had heard when Baruch read from the scroll in the hearing of the people.
Jeremiah,36,14,"Then all the officials sent word to Baruch through Jehudi son of Nethaniah, son of Shelemiah, son of Cushi, saying, “Bring the scroll that you read in the hearing of the people, and come.” So Baruch son of Neriah took the scroll and went to them."
Jeremiah,36,15,"They said to him, “Sit down and read it in our hearing.” So Baruch read it in their hearing."
Jeremiah,36,16,"When they had heard all the words, they turned to each other in fear and said to Baruch, “We must surely tell the king all these things.”"
Jeremiah,36,17,"Then they asked Baruch, “Tell us—how did you write all these words? At his dictation?”"
Jeremiah,36,18,"Baruch said to them, “At his dictation. He recited all these words to me while I was writing on the scroll in ink.”"
Jeremiah,36,19,"The officials said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah must hide yourselves and tell no one where you are.”"
Jeremiah,36,20,"Then they came to the king at the courtyard, having deposited the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and reported everything in the hearing of the king."
Jeremiah,36,21,"The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the scribe. Jehudi then read it in the hearing of the king and all the officials who were standing by the king."
Jeremiah,36,22,"Since it was the ninth month, the king was sitting in his winter quarters with a fire burning in front of him."
Jeremiah,36,23,"As soon as Jehudi would read three or four columns, Jehoiakim would cut the scroll with a scribe’s knife and throw the columns into the blazing fire until the entire scroll was consumed by the fire in the brazier."
Jeremiah,36,24,"As they heard all these words, the king and all of his servants did not become terrified or tear their garments."
Jeremiah,36,25,"Even though Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah had urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them."
Jeremiah,36,26,"Then the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet, but the LORD had hidden them."
Jeremiah,36,27,"After the king had burned the scroll with the words Baruch had written at Jeremiah’s dictation, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:"
Jeremiah,36,28,"“Take another scroll, and once again write on it the very words that were on the original scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah burned."
Jeremiah,36,29,"You are to proclaim concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: This is what the LORD says: You have burned the scroll, saying, ‘Why have you written on it: The king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land and cause it to be without man or beast?’"
Jeremiah,36,30,"Therefore, this is what the LORD says concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He will have no one to sit on David’s throne, and his corpse will be thrown out to be exposed to the heat of day and the frost of night."
Jeremiah,36,31,"I will punish him, his descendants, and his officers for their wrongdoing. I will bring on them, on the residents of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah all the disaster, which I warned them about but they did not listen.”"
Jeremiah,36,32,"Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch son of Neriah, the scribe, and he wrote on it at Jeremiah’s dictation all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim, Judah’s king, had burned in the fire. And many other words like them were added."
Jeremiah,37,1,"Zedekiah son of Josiah reigned as king in the land of Judah in place of Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made him king."
Jeremiah,37,2,He and his officers and the people of the land did not obey the words of the LORD that He spoke through Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah,37,3,"Nevertheless, King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, the priest, to Jeremiah the prophet, requesting, “Please pray to the LORD our God for us!”"
Jeremiah,37,4,"Jeremiah was going about his daily tasks among the people, for they had not yet put him into the prison."
Jeremiah,37,5,"Pharaoh’s army had left Egypt, and when the Chaldeans, who were besieging Jerusalem, heard the report, they withdrew from Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,37,6,The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet:
Jeremiah,37,7,"“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: This is what you will say to Judah’s king, who is sending you to inquire of Me: Watch: Pharaoh’s army, which has come out to help you, is going to return to its own land of Egypt."
Jeremiah,37,8,The Chaldeans will then return and fight against this city. They will capture it and burn it down.
Jeremiah,37,9,"This is what the LORD says: Don’t deceive yourselves by saying, ‘The Chaldeans will leave us for good,’ for they will not leave."
Jeremiah,37,10,"Indeed, if you were to strike down the entire Chaldean army that is fighting with you, and there remained among them only the badly wounded men, each in his tent, they would get up and burn this city down.”"
Jeremiah,37,11,"When the Chaldean army withdrew from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s army,"
Jeremiah,37,12,Jeremiah started to leave Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to claim his portion there among the people.
Jeremiah,37,13,"But when he was at the Benjamin Gate, an officer of the guard was there, whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah, son of Hananiah, and he apprehended Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are deserting to the Chaldeans.”"
Jeremiah,37,14,"“That’s a lie,” Jeremiah replied. “I am not deserting to the Chaldeans!” Irijah would not listen to him but apprehended Jeremiah and took him to the officials."
Jeremiah,37,15,"The officials were angry at Jeremiah and beat him and placed him in jail in the house of Jonathan the scribe, for it had been made into a prison."
Jeremiah,37,16,So Jeremiah went into a cell in the dungeon and stayed there many days.
Jeremiah,37,17,"King Zedekiah later sent for him and received him, and in his house privately asked him, “Is there a word from the LORD?” “There is,” Jeremiah responded, and he continued, “You will be handed over to the king of Babylon.”"
Jeremiah,37,18,"Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “How have I sinned against you or your servants or these people that you have put me in prison?"
Jeremiah,37,19,"Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, claiming, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you and this land’?"
Jeremiah,37,20,"So now please listen, my lord the king. May my petition come before you. Don’t send me back to the house of Jonathan the scribe, or I will die there.”"
Jeremiah,37,21,"So King Zedekiah gave orders, and Jeremiah was placed in the guard’s courtyard. He was given a loaf of bread each day from the baker’s street until all the bread was gone from the city. So Jeremiah remained in the guard’s courtyard."
Jeremiah,38,1,"Now Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malchijah heard the words Jeremiah was speaking to all the people:"
Jeremiah,38,2,"“This is what the LORD says: ‘Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine, and plague, but whoever surrenders to the Chaldeans will live. He will keep his life like the spoils of war and will live.’"
Jeremiah,38,3,"This is what the LORD says: ‘This city will most certainly be handed over to the king of Babylon’s army, and he will capture it.’”"
Jeremiah,38,4,"The officials then said to the king, “This man ought to die, because he is weakening the morale of the warriors who remain in this city and of all the people by speaking to them in this way. This man is not seeking the well-being of this people, but disaster.”"
Jeremiah,38,5,"King Zedekiah said, “Here he is; he’s in your hands since the king can’t do anything against you.”"
Jeremiah,38,6,"So they took Jeremiah and dropped him into the cistern of Malchiah the king’s son, which was in the guard’s courtyard, lowering Jeremiah with ropes. There was no water in the cistern, only mud, and Jeremiah sank in the mud."
Jeremiah,38,7,"But Ebed-melech, a Cushite court official employed in the king’s palace, heard Jeremiah had been put into the cistern. While the king was sitting at the Benjamin Gate,"
Jeremiah,38,8,Ebed-melech went from the king’s palace and spoke to the king:
Jeremiah,38,9,"“My lord the king, these men have been evil in all they have done to Jeremiah the prophet. They have dropped him into the cistern where he will die from hunger, because there is no more bread in the city.”"
Jeremiah,38,10,"So the king commanded Ebed-melech, the Cushite, “Take from here 30 men under your authority and pull Jeremiah the prophet up from the cistern before he dies.”"
Jeremiah,38,11,So Ebed-melech took the men under his authority and went to the king’s palace to a place below the storehouse. From there he took old rags and worn-out clothes and lowered them by ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern.
Jeremiah,38,12,"Ebed-melech the Cushite cried out to Jeremiah, “Place these old rags and clothes between your armpits and the ropes.” Jeremiah did so,"
Jeremiah,38,13,"and they pulled him up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern, but he continued to stay in the guard’s courtyard."
Jeremiah,38,14,"King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and received him at the third entrance of the LORD’s temple. The king said to Jeremiah, “I am going to ask you something; don’t hide anything from me.”"
Jeremiah,38,15,"Jeremiah replied to Zedekiah, “If I tell you, you will kill me, won’t you? Besides, if I give you advice, you won’t listen to me anyway.”"
Jeremiah,38,16,"King Zedekiah swore to Jeremiah in private, “As the LORD lives, who has given us this life, I will not kill you or hand you over to these men who want to take your life.”"
Jeremiah,38,17,"Jeremiah therefore said to Zedekiah, “This is what the LORD, the God of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘If indeed you surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then you will live, this city will not be burned down, and you and your household will survive."
Jeremiah,38,18,"But if you do not surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then this city will be handed over to the Chaldeans. They will burn it down, and you yourself will not escape from them.’”"
Jeremiah,38,19,"But King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am worried about the Judeans who have deserted to the Chaldeans. They may hand me over to the Judeans to abuse me.”"
Jeremiah,38,20,"“They will not hand you over,” Jeremiah replied. “Obey the voice of the LORD in what I am telling you, so it may go well for you and you can live."
Jeremiah,38,21,"But if you refuse to surrender, this is the verdict that the LORD has shown me:"
Jeremiah,38,22,"‘All the women who remain in the palace of Judah’s king will be brought out to the officials of the king of Babylon and will say: Your trusted friends misled you and overcame you. Your feet sank into the mire, and they deserted you."
Jeremiah,38,23,"All your wives and sons will be brought out to the Chaldeans. You yourself will not escape from them, for you will be seized by the king of Babylon and this city will burn down.’”"
Jeremiah,38,24,"Then Zedekiah warned Jeremiah, “Don’t let anyone know about these things or you will die."
Jeremiah,38,25,"If the officials hear that I have spoken with you and come and demand of you, ‘Tell us what you said to the king; don’t hide anything from us and we won’t kill you. Also, what did the king say to you?’"
Jeremiah,38,26,"then you will tell them, ‘I was bringing before the king my petition that he not return me to the house of Jonathan to die there.’”"
Jeremiah,38,27,"When all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him, he reported the exact words to them the king had commanded, and they quit speaking with him because nothing had been heard."
Jeremiah,38,28,"Jeremiah remained in the guard’s courtyard until the day Jerusalem was captured, and he was there when it happened."
Jeremiah,39,1,"In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon advanced against Jerusalem with his entire army and laid siege to it."
Jeremiah,39,2,"In the fourth month of Zedekiah’s eleventh year, on the ninth day of the month, the city was broken into."
Jeremiah,39,3,"All the officials of the king of Babylon entered and sat at the Middle Gate: Nergal-sharezer, Samgar, Nebusarsechim the Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer the Rab-mag, and all the rest of the officials of Babylon’s king."
Jeremiah,39,4,"When he saw them, Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers fled. They left the city at night by way of the king’s garden through the gate between the two walls. They left along the route to the Arabah."
Jeremiah,39,5,"However, the Chaldean army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, arrested him, and brought him to Nebuchadnezzar, Babylon’s king, at Riblah in the land of Hamath. The king passed sentence on him there."
Jeremiah,39,6,"At Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered Zedekiah’s sons before his eyes, and he also slaughtered all Judah’s nobles."
Jeremiah,39,7,Then he blinded Zedekiah and put him in bronze chains to take him to Babylon.
Jeremiah,39,8,The Chaldeans next burned down the king’s palace and the people’s houses and tore down the walls of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,39,9,"Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, deported the rest of the people to Babylon—those who had remained in the city and those deserters who had defected to him along with the rest of the people who had remained."
Jeremiah,39,10,"However, Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, left in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing, and he gave them vineyards and fields at that time."
Jeremiah,39,11,"Speaking through Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon gave orders concerning Jeremiah, saying:"
Jeremiah,39,12,"“Take him, look after him, and don’t let any harm come to him; do for him whatever he says.”"
Jeremiah,39,13,"Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, Nebushazban the Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer the Rab-mag, and all the captains of the king of Babylon"
Jeremiah,39,14,"had Jeremiah brought from the guard’s courtyard and turned him over to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, to take him home. So he settled among his own people."
Jeremiah,39,15,Now the word of the LORD had come to Jeremiah when he was confined in the guard’s courtyard:
Jeremiah,39,16,"“Go tell Ebed-melech the Cushite: This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am about to fulfill My words for harm and not for good against this city. They will take place before your eyes on that day."
Jeremiah,39,17,But I will rescue you on that day”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“and you will not be handed over to the men you fear.
Jeremiah,39,18,"Indeed, I will certainly deliver you so that you do not fall by the sword. Because you have trusted in Me, you will keep your life like the spoils of war.” This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,40,1,"This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD after Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, released him at Ramah. When he found him, he was bound in chains with all the exiles of Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon."
Jeremiah,40,2,"The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, “The LORD your God decreed this disaster on this place,"
Jeremiah,40,3,"and the LORD has fulfilled it. He has done just what He decreed. Because you people have sinned against the LORD and have not obeyed Him, this thing has happened."
Jeremiah,40,4,"Now pay attention: Today I am setting you free from the chains that were on your hands. If it pleases you to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will take care of you. But if it seems wrong to you to come with me to Babylon, go no farther. Look—the whole land is in front of you. Wherever it seems good and right for you to go, go there.”"
Jeremiah,40,5,"When Jeremiah had not yet turned to go, Nebuzaradan said to him: “Return to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the cities of Judah, and stay with him among the people or go wherever you want to go.” So the captain of the guard gave him a ration and a gift and released him."
Jeremiah,40,6,"Jeremiah therefore went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah, and he stayed with him among the people who remained in the land."
Jeremiah,40,7,"When all the commanders of the armies in the field—they and their men—heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam over the land and that he had put him in charge of the men, women, and children from the poorest of the land who had not been deported to Babylon,"
Jeremiah,40,8,"they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. The commanders included Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah son of the Maacathite—they and their men."
Jeremiah,40,9,"Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, swore an oath to them and their men, assuring them, “Don’t be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well for you."
Jeremiah,40,10,"As for me, I am going to live in Mizpah to represent you before the Chaldeans who come to us. As for you, gather wine, summer fruit, and oil, place them in your storage jars, and live in the cities you have captured.”"
Jeremiah,40,11,"When all the Judeans in Moab and among the Ammonites and in Edom and in all the other lands also heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, over them,"
Jeremiah,40,12,"they all returned from all the places where they had been banished and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and harvested a great amount of wine and summer fruit."
Jeremiah,40,13,"Meanwhile, Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies in the field came to Gedaliah at Mizpah"
Jeremiah,40,14,"and warned him, “Don’t you realize that Baalis, king of the Ammonites, has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to kill you?” But Gedaliah son of Ahikam would not believe them."
Jeremiah,40,15,"Then Johanan son of Kareah suggested to Gedaliah in private at Mizpah, “Let me go kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah. No one will know it. Why should he kill you and scatter all of Judah that has gathered to you so that the remnant of Judah would perish?”"
Jeremiah,40,16,"But Gedaliah son of Ahikam responded to Johanan son of Kareah, “Don’t do that! What you’re saying about Ishmael is a lie.”"
Jeremiah,41,1,"In the seventh month, Ishmael son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of the royal family and one of the king’s chief officers, came with 10 men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah. They ate a meal together there in Mizpah,"
Jeremiah,41,2,"but then Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the 10 men who were with him got up and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, with the sword; he killed the one the king of Babylon had appointed in the land."
Jeremiah,41,3,"Ishmael also struck down all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, as well as the Chaldean soldiers who were there."
Jeremiah,41,4,"On the second day after he had killed Gedaliah, when no one knew yet,"
Jeremiah,41,5,"80 men came from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria who had shaved their beards, torn their garments, and gashed themselves, and who were carrying grain and incense offerings to bring to the temple of the LORD."
Jeremiah,41,6,"Ishmael son of Nethaniah came out of Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he came. When he encountered them, he said: “Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam!”"
Jeremiah,41,7,"But when they came into the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men with him slaughtered them and threw them into a cistern."
Jeremiah,41,8,"However, there were 10 men among them who said to Ishmael, “Don’t kill us, for we have hidden treasure in the field—wheat, barley, oil, and honey!” So he stopped and did not kill them along with their companions."
Jeremiah,41,9,Now the cistern where Ishmael had thrown all the corpses of the men he had struck down was a large one that King Asa had made in the encounter with Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain.
Jeremiah,41,10,"Then Ishmael took captive all the remnant of the people of Mizpah including the daughters of the king—all those who remained in Mizpah over whom Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive and set off to cross over to the Ammonites."
Jeremiah,41,11,"When Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael son of Nethaniah had done,"
Jeremiah,41,12,they took all their men and went to fight with Ishmael son of Nethaniah and found him by the great pool in Gibeon.
Jeremiah,41,13,"When all the people with Ishmael saw Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the army with him, they rejoiced,"
Jeremiah,41,14,and all the people whom Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and rejoined Johanan son of Kareah.
Jeremiah,41,15,But Ishmael son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to the Ammonites.
Jeremiah,41,16,"Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies with him then took from Mizpah all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael son of Nethaniah after Ishmael had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam—men, soldiers, women, children, and court officials whom he brought back from Gibeon."
Jeremiah,41,17,"They left, stopping in Geruth Chimham, which is near Bethlehem, in order to make their way into Egypt,"
Jeremiah,41,18,"away from the Chaldeans. For they feared them because Ishmael son of Nethaniah had struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed in the land."
Jeremiah,42,1,"Then all the commanders of the armies, along with Johanan son of Kareah, Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest, approached"
Jeremiah,42,2,"Jeremiah the prophet and said, “May our petition come before you; pray to the LORD your God on our behalf, on behalf of this entire remnant (for few of us remain out of the many, as you can see with your own eyes),"
Jeremiah,42,3,that the LORD your God may tell us the way we should walk and the thing we should do.”
Jeremiah,42,4,"So Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard. I will now pray to the LORD your God according to your words, and every word that the LORD answers you I will tell you; I won’t withhold a word from you.”"
Jeremiah,42,5,"And they said to Jeremiah, “As for every word the LORD your God sends you to tell us, if we don’t act accordingly, may the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us."
Jeremiah,42,6,"Whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God to whom we are sending you so that it may go well with us. We will certainly obey the voice of the LORD our God!”"
Jeremiah,42,7,"Now at the end of 10 days, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah,"
Jeremiah,42,8,"and he summoned Johanan son of Kareah, all the commanders of the armies who were with him, and all the people from the least to the greatest."
Jeremiah,42,9,"He said to them, “This is what the LORD says, the God of Israel to whom you sent me to bring your petition before Him:"
Jeremiah,42,10,"‘If you will indeed stay in this land, then I will rebuild and not demolish you, and I will plant and not uproot you, because I relent concerning the disaster that I have brought on you."
Jeremiah,42,11,Don’t be afraid of the king of Babylon whom you now fear; don’t be afraid of him’—this is the LORD’s declaration—‘because I am with you to save you and deliver you from him.
Jeremiah,42,12,"I will grant you compassion, and he will have compassion on you and allow you to return to your own soil."
Jeremiah,42,13,"But if you say, ‘We will not stay in this land,’ so as not to obey the voice of the LORD your God,"
Jeremiah,42,14,"and if you say, ‘No, instead we’ll go to the land of Egypt where we will not see war or hear the sound of the ram’s horn or hunger for food, and we’ll live there,’"
Jeremiah,42,15,"then hear the word of the LORD, remnant of Judah! This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: If you are firmly resolved to go to Egypt and live there for a while,"
Jeremiah,42,16,"then the sword you fear will overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine you are worried about will follow on your heels there to Egypt, and you will die there."
Jeremiah,42,17,"All who resolve to go to Egypt to live there for a while will die by the sword, famine, and plague. They will have no one escape or survive from the disaster I will bring on them.’"
Jeremiah,42,18,"“For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Just as My anger and fury were poured out on Jerusalem’s residents, so will My fury pour out on you if you go to Egypt. You will become an object of cursing, scorn, execration, and disgrace, and you will never see this place again.’"
Jeremiah,42,19,"The LORD has spoken concerning you, remnant of Judah: ‘Don’t go to Egypt.’ Know for certain that I have warned you today!"
Jeremiah,42,20,"You have led your own selves astray because you are the ones who sent me to the LORD your God, saying, ‘Pray to the LORD our God on our behalf, and as for all that the LORD our God says, tell it to us, and we’ll act accordingly.’"
Jeremiah,42,21,"For I have told you today, but you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God in everything He has sent me to tell you."
Jeremiah,42,22,"Now therefore, know for certain that by the sword, famine, and plague you will die in the place where you desired to go to live for a while.”"
Jeremiah,43,1,When Jeremiah had finished speaking to all the people all the words of the LORD their God—all these words the LORD their God had sent him to give them—
Jeremiah,43,2,"then Azariah son of Hoshaiah, Johanan son of Kareah, and all the other arrogant men responded to Jeremiah, “You are speaking a lie! The LORD our God has not sent you to say, ‘You must not go to Egypt to live there for a while!’"
Jeremiah,43,3,"Rather, Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us to hand us over to the Chaldeans to put us to death or to deport us to Babylon!”"
Jeremiah,43,4,So Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies did not obey the voice of the LORD to stay in the land of Judah.
Jeremiah,43,5,"Instead, Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies took the whole remnant of Judah, those who had returned from all the nations where they had been banished to live in the land of Judah for a while—"
Jeremiah,43,6,"the men, women, children, king’s daughters, and everyone whom Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, had allowed to remain with Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, along with Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah—"
Jeremiah,43,7,and they went to the land of Egypt because they did not obey the voice of the LORD. They went as far as Tahpanhes.
Jeremiah,43,8,Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah at Tahpanhes:
Jeremiah,43,9,“Pick up some large stones and set them in the mortar of the brick pavement that is at the opening of Pharaoh’s palace at Tahpanhes. Do this in the sight of the Judean men
Jeremiah,43,10,"and tell them: This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I will send for My servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and I will place his throne on these stones that I have embedded, and he will pitch his pavilion over them."
Jeremiah,43,11,"He will come and strike down the land of Egypt—those destined for death, to death; those destined for captivity, to captivity; and those destined for the sword, to the sword."
Jeremiah,43,12,"I will kindle a fire in the temples of Egypt’s gods, and he will burn them and take them prisoner. He will clean the land of Egypt as a shepherd picks lice off his garment, and he will leave there unscathed."
Jeremiah,43,13,He will smash the sacred pillars of the sun temple in the land of Egypt and burn down the temples of the Egyptian gods.”
Jeremiah,44,1,"This is the word that came to Jeremiah for all the Jews living in the land of Egypt—at Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and in the land of Pathros:"
Jeremiah,44,2,"“This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: You have seen all the disaster I brought against Jerusalem and all Judah’s cities; look, they are a ruin today without an inhabitant in them"
Jeremiah,44,3,"because of their evil ways that provoked Me to anger, going and burning incense to serve other gods that they, you, and your fathers did not know."
Jeremiah,44,4,"So I sent you all My servants the prophets time and time again, saying: Don’t do this detestable thing that I hate."
Jeremiah,44,5,But they did not listen or pay attention; they did not turn from their evil or stop burning incense to other gods.
Jeremiah,44,6,So My fierce wrath poured out and burned in Judah’s cities and Jerusalem’s streets so that they became the desolate ruin they are today.
Jeremiah,44,7,"“So now, this is what the LORD, the God of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Why are you doing such great harm to yourselves? You are cutting off man and woman, child and infant from Judah, leaving yourselves without a remnant."
Jeremiah,44,8,"You are provoking Me to anger by the work of your hands. You are burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have gone to live for a while. As a result, you will be cut off and become an object of cursing and insult among all the nations of earth."
Jeremiah,44,9,"Have you forgotten the evils of your fathers, the evils of Judah’s kings, the evils of their wives, your own evils, and the evils of your wives that were committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?"
Jeremiah,44,10,"They have not become humble to this day, and they have not feared or followed My instruction or My statutes that I set before you and your ancestors."
Jeremiah,44,11,"“Therefore, this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am about to turn against you to bring disaster, to cut off all Judah."
Jeremiah,44,12,"And I will take away the remnant of Judah, those who have resolved to go to the land of Egypt to live there for a while; they will meet their end. All of them in the land of Egypt will fall by the sword; they will meet their end by famine. From the least to the greatest, they will die by the sword and by famine. Then they will become an object of cursing, scorn, execration, and disgrace."
Jeremiah,44,13,"I will punish those living in the land of Egypt just as I punished Jerusalem by sword, famine, and plague."
Jeremiah,44,14,"Then the remnant of Judah—those going to live for a while there in the land of Egypt—will have no fugitive or survivor to return to the land of Judah where they are longing to return to live, for they will not return except for a few fugitives.”"
Jeremiah,44,15,"However, all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, all the women standing by—a great assembly—and all the people who were living in the land of Egypt at Pathros answered Jeremiah,"
Jeremiah,44,16,"“As for the word you spoke to us in the name of Yahweh, we are not going to listen to you!"
Jeremiah,44,17,"Instead, we will do everything we said we would: burn incense to the queen of heaven and offer drink offerings to her just as we, our fathers, our kings, and our officials did in Judah’s cities and in Jerusalem’s streets. Then we had enough food and good things and saw no disaster,"
Jeremiah,44,18,"but from the time we ceased to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to offer her drink offerings, we have lacked everything, and through sword and famine we have met our end.”"
Jeremiah,44,19,"And the women said, “When we burned incense to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, was it apart from our husbands’ knowledge that we made sacrificial cakes in her image and poured out drink offerings to her?”"
Jeremiah,44,20,"But Jeremiah responded to all the people—the men, women, and all the people who were answering him:"
Jeremiah,44,21,"“As for the incense you burned in Judah’s cities and in Jerusalem’s streets—you, your fathers, your kings, your officials, and the people of the land—did the LORD not remember them? He brought this to mind."
Jeremiah,44,22,"The LORD can no longer bear your evil deeds and the detestable acts you have committed, so your land has become a waste, a desolation, and an object of cursing, without inhabitant, as you see today."
Jeremiah,44,23,"Because you burned incense and sinned against the LORD and didn’t obey the LORD’s voice and didn’t follow His instruction, His statutes, and His testimonies, this disaster has come to you, as you see today.”"
Jeremiah,44,24,"Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women, “Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt."
Jeremiah,44,25,"This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘As for you and your wives, you women have spoken with your mouths, and you men fulfilled it by your deeds, saying, “We will keep our vows that we have made to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings for her.” Go ahead, confirm your vows! Pay your vows!’"
Jeremiah,44,26,"“Therefore, hear the word of the LORD, all you Judeans who live in the land of Egypt: ‘I have sworn by My great name, says Yahweh, that My name will never again be invoked by anyone of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, “As the Lord GOD lives.”"
Jeremiah,44,27,"I am watching over them for disaster and not for good, and every man of Judah who is in the land of Egypt will meet his end by sword or famine until they are finished off."
Jeremiah,44,28,"Those who escape the sword will return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah only few in number, and the whole remnant of Judah, the ones going to the land of Egypt to live there for a while, will know whose word stands, Mine or theirs!"
Jeremiah,44,29,"This will be a sign to you’—this is the LORD’s declaration—‘that I am about to punish you in this place, so you may know that My words of disaster concerning you will certainly come to pass."
Jeremiah,44,30,"This is what the LORD says: I am about to hand over Pharaoh Hophra, Egypt’s king, to his enemies, to those who want to take his life, just as I handed over Judah’s King Zedekiah to Babylon’s King Nebuchadnezzar, who was his enemy, the one who wanted to take his life.’”"
Jeremiah,45,1,"This is the word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch son of Neriah when he wrote these words on a scroll at Jeremiah’s dictation in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah:"
Jeremiah,45,2,"“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch:"
Jeremiah,45,3,"‘You have said, “Woe is me, because the LORD has added misery to my pain! I am worn out with groaning and have found no rest.”’"
Jeremiah,45,4,"“This is what you are to say to him: ‘This is what the LORD says: What I have built I am about to demolish, and what I have planted I am about to uproot—the whole land!"
Jeremiah,45,5,"But as for you, do you seek great things for yourself? Stop seeking! For I am about to bring disaster on every living creature’—this is the LORD’s declaration—‘but I will grant you your life like the spoils of war wherever you go.’”"
Jeremiah,46,1,The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet about the nations:
Jeremiah,46,2,"About Egypt and the army of Pharaoh Neco, Egypt’s king, which was defeated at Carchemish on the Euphrates River by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon in the fourth year of Judah’s King Jehoiakim son of Josiah:"
Jeremiah,46,3,Deploy small shields and large; draw near for battle!
Jeremiah,46,4,Harness the horses; mount the steeds; take your positions with helmets on! Polish the lances; put on armor!
Jeremiah,46,5,"Why have I seen this? They are terrified, they are retreating, their warriors are crushed, they flee headlong, they never look back, terror is on every side! This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,46,6,"The swift cannot flee, and the warrior cannot escape! In the north by the bank of the Euphrates River, they stumble and fall."
Jeremiah,46,7,"Who is this, rising like the Nile, like rivers whose waters churn?"
Jeremiah,46,8,"Egypt rises like the Nile, and its waters churn like rivers. He boasts, “I will go up, I will cover the earth; I will destroy cities with their residents.”"
Jeremiah,46,9,"Rise up, you cavalry! Race furiously, you chariots! Let the warriors go out— Cush and Put, who are able to handle shields, and the Ludim, who are able to handle and string the bow."
Jeremiah,46,10,"That day belongs to the Lord, the GOD of Hosts, a day of vengeance to avenge Himself against His adversaries. The sword will devour and be satisfied; it will drink its fill of their blood, because it will be a sacrifice to the Lord, the GOD of Hosts, in the northern land by the Euphrates River."
Jeremiah,46,11,"Go up to Gilead and get balm, Virgin Daughter Egypt! You have multiplied remedies in vain; there is no healing for you."
Jeremiah,46,12,"The nations have heard of your dishonor, and your outcry fills the earth, because warrior stumbles against warrior and together both of them have fallen."
Jeremiah,46,13,This is the word the LORD spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about the coming of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to defeat the land of Egypt:
Jeremiah,46,14,"Announce it in Egypt, and proclaim it in Migdol! Proclaim it in Memphis and in Tahpanhes! Say: Take positions! Prepare yourself, for the sword devours all around you."
Jeremiah,46,15,"Why have your strong ones been swept away? Each has not stood, for the LORD has thrust him down."
Jeremiah,46,16,"He continues to stumble. Indeed, each falls over the other. They say, “Get up! Let’s return to our people and to the land of our birth, away from the sword that oppresses.”"
Jeremiah,46,17,"There they will cry out, “Pharaoh king of Egypt was all noise; he let the opportune moment pass.”"
Jeremiah,46,18,As I live— this is the King’s declaration; Yahweh of Hosts is His name. He will come like Tabor among the mountains and like Carmel by the sea.
Jeremiah,46,19,"Get your bags ready for exile, inhabitant of Daughter Egypt! For Memphis will become a desolation, uninhabited ruins."
Jeremiah,46,20,"Egypt is a beautiful young cow, but a horsefly from the north is coming against her."
Jeremiah,46,21,"Even her mercenaries among her are like stall-fed calves. They too will turn back; together they will flee; they will not take their stand, for the day of their calamity is coming on them, the time of their punishment."
Jeremiah,46,22,"Egypt will hiss like a slithering snake, for the enemy will come with an army; with axes they will come against her like those who cut trees."

Jeremiah,46,26,"I will hand them over to those who want to take their lives—to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his officers. But after this, it will be inhabited again as in ancient times.” This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,46,27,"But you, My servant Jacob, do not be afraid, and do not be discouraged, Israel, for without fail I will save you from far away and your descendants, from the land of their captivity! Jacob will return and have calm and quiet with no one to frighten him."
Jeremiah,46,28,"And you, My servant Jacob, do not be afraid— this is the LORD’s declaration— for I will be with you. I will bring destruction on all the nations where I have banished you, but I will not bring destruction on you. I will discipline you with justice, and I will by no means leave you unpunished."
Jeremiah,47,1,This is the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet about the Philistines before Pharaoh defeated Gaza.

Jeremiah,47,5,"Baldness is coming to Gaza. Ashkelon will become silent, a remnant of their valley. How long will you gash yourself?"
Jeremiah,47,6,"Oh, sword of the LORD! How long will you be restless? Go back to your sheath; be still; be silent!"
Jeremiah,47,7,How can it rest when the LORD has given it a command? He has assigned it against Ashkelon and the shore of the sea.
Jeremiah,48,1,"About Moab, this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Woe to Nebo, because it is about to be destroyed; Kiriathaim will be put to shame; it will be taken captive. The fortress will be put to shame and dismayed!"

Jeremiah,48,3,"A voice cries out from Horonaim, “devastation and great disaster!”"
Jeremiah,48,4,Moab will be shattered; her little ones will cry out.

Jeremiah,48,6,Flee! Save your lives! Be like a juniper bush in the wilderness.
Jeremiah,48,7,"Because you trust in your works and treasures, you will be captured also. Chemosh will go into exile with his priests and officials."

Jeremiah,48,10,"The one who does the LORD’s business deceitfully is cursed, and the one who withholds his sword from bloodshed is cursed."
Jeremiah,48,11,"Moab has been left quiet since his youth, settled like wine on its dregs. He hasn’t been poured from one container to another or gone into exile. So his taste has remained the same, and his aroma hasn’t changed."
Jeremiah,48,12,"Therefore look, the days are coming— this is the LORD’s declaration— when I will send those to him, who will pour him out. They will empty his containers and smash his jars."
Jeremiah,48,13,"Moab will be put to shame because of Chemosh, just as the house of Israel was put to shame because of Bethel that they trusted in."
Jeremiah,48,14,"How can you say, “We are warriors— mighty men ready for battle”?"

Jeremiah,48,23,"Kiriathaim, Beth-gamul, Beth-meon,"
Jeremiah,48,24,"Kerioth, Bozrah, and all the towns of the land of Moab, those far and near."
Jeremiah,48,25,Moab’s horn is chopped off; his arm is shattered.” This is the LORD’s declaration.
Jeremiah,48,26,"“Make him drunk, because he has exalted himself against the LORD. Moab will wallow in his own vomit, and he will also become a laughingstock."

Jeremiah,48,31,"Therefore, I will wail over Moab. I will cry out for Moab, all of it; he will moan for the men of Kir-heres."
Jeremiah,48,32,"I will weep for you, vine of Sibmah, with more than the weeping for Jazer. Your tendrils have extended to the sea; they have reached to the sea and to Jazer. The destroyer has fallen on your summer fruit and grape harvest."
Jeremiah,48,33,Joy and celebration are taken from the fertile field and from the land of Moab. I have stopped the flow of wine from the winepresses; no one will tread with shouts of joy. The shouting is not a shout of joy.
Jeremiah,48,34,“There is a cry from Heshbon to Elealeh; they raise their voices as far as Jahaz—from Zoar to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyah—because even the waters of Nimrim have become desolate.
Jeremiah,48,35,"In Moab, I will stop”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“the one who offers sacrifices on the high place and burns incense to his gods."
Jeremiah,48,36,"Therefore, My heart moans like flutes for Moab, and My heart moans like flutes for the people of Kir-heres. And therefore, the wealth he has gained has perished."

Jeremiah,49,1,"About the Ammonites, this is what the LORD says: Does Israel have no sons? Is he without an heir? Why then has Milcom dispossessed Gad and his people settled in their cities?"
Jeremiah,49,2,"Therefore look, the days are coming— this is the LORD’s declaration— when I will make the shout of battle heard against Rabbah of the Ammonites. It will become a desolate mound, and its villages will be burned down. Israel will dispossess their dispossessors, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,49,3,"Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is devastated; cry out, daughters of Rabbah! Clothe yourselves with sackcloth, and lament; run back and forth within your walls, because Milcom will go into exile together with his priests and officials."

Jeremiah,49,14,I have heard a message from the LORD; a messenger has been sent among the nations: Assemble yourselves to come against her. Rise up for war!
Jeremiah,49,15,"Look, I will certainly make you insignificant among the nations, despised among humanity."
Jeremiah,49,16,"As to the terror you cause, your presumptuous heart has deceived you. You who live in the clefts of the rock, you who occupy the mountain summit, though you elevate your nest like the eagle, even from there I will bring you down. This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,49,17,“Edom will become a desolation. Everyone who passes by her will be horrified and scoff because of all her wounds.

Jeremiah,49,19,"“Look, it will be like a lion coming from the thickets of the Jordan to the watered grazing land. Indeed, I will chase Edom away from her land in a flash. I will appoint whoever is chosen for her. For who is like Me? Who will summon Me? Who is the shepherd who can stand against Me?”"

Jeremiah,49,30,"Run! Escape quickly! Lie low, residents of Hazor— this is the LORD’s declaration— for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has drawn up a plan against you; he has devised a strategy against you."

Jeremiah,50,9,For I will soon stir up and bring against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country. They will line up in battle formation against her; from there she will be captured. Their arrows will be like those of a skilled warrior who does not return empty-handed.
Jeremiah,50,10,The Chaldeans will become plunder; all Babylon’s plunderers will be fully satisfied. This is the LORD’s declaration.
Jeremiah,50,11,"Because you rejoice, because you sing in triumph— you who plundered My inheritance— because you frolic like a young cow treading grain and neigh like stallions,"

Jeremiah,50,41,Look! A people comes from the north. A great nation and many kings will be stirred up from the remote regions of the earth.
Jeremiah,50,42,"They grasp bow and javelin. They are cruel and show no mercy. Their voice roars like the sea, and they ride on horses, lined up like men in battle formation against you, Daughter Babylon."
Jeremiah,50,43,"The king of Babylon has heard reports about them, and his hands fall helpless. Distress has seized him— pain, like a woman in labor."
Jeremiah,50,44,"“Look, it will be like a lion coming from the thickets of the Jordan to the watered grazing land. Indeed, I will chase Babylon away from her land in a flash. I will appoint whoever is chosen for her. For who is like Me? Who will summon Me? Who is the shepherd who can stand against Me?”"
Jeremiah,50,45,"Therefore, hear the plans that the LORD has drawn up against Babylon and the strategies He has devised against the land of the Chaldeans: Certainly the flock’s little lambs will be dragged away; certainly the grazing land will be made desolate because of them."
Jeremiah,50,46,At the sound of Babylon’s conquest the earth will quake; a cry will be heard among the nations.

Jeremiah,51,3,Don’t let the archer string his bow; don’t let him put on his armor. Don’t spare her young men; completely destroy her entire army!
Jeremiah,51,4,"Those who were slain will fall in the land of the Chaldeans, those who were pierced through, in her streets."

Jeremiah,51,7,"Babylon was a gold cup in the LORD’s hand, making the whole earth drunk. The nations drank her wine; therefore, the nations go mad."
Jeremiah,51,8,Suddenly Babylon fell and was shattered. Wail for her; get balm for her wound— perhaps she can be healed.
Jeremiah,51,9,"We tried to heal Babylon, but she could not be healed. Abandon her! Let each of us go to his own land, for her judgment extends to the sky and reaches as far as the clouds."
Jeremiah,51,10,"The LORD has brought about our vindication; come, let’s tell in Zion what the LORD our God has accomplished."
Jeremiah,51,11,"Sharpen the arrows! Fill the quivers! The LORD has put it into the mind of the kings of the Medes because His plan is aimed at Babylon to destroy her, for it is the LORD’s vengeance, vengeance for His temple."
Jeremiah,51,12,Raise up a signal flag against the walls of Babylon; fortify the watch post; set the watchmen in place; prepare the ambush. For the LORD has both planned and accomplished what He has threatened against those who live in Babylon.

Jeremiah,51,18,"They are worthless, a work to be mocked. At the time of their punishment they will be destroyed."
Jeremiah,51,19,Jacob’s Portion is not like these because He is the One who formed all things. Israel is the tribe of His inheritance; Yahweh of Hosts is His name.
Jeremiah,51,20,"You are My battle club, My weapons of war. With you I will smash nations; with you I will bring kingdoms to ruin."
Jeremiah,51,21,With you I will smash the horse and its rider; with you I will smash the chariot and its rider.

Jeremiah,51,46,"May you not become cowardly and fearful when the report is proclaimed in the land, for the report will come one year, and then another the next year. There will be violence in the land with ruler against ruler."
Jeremiah,51,47,"Therefore, look, the days are coming when I will punish Babylon’s carved images. Her entire land will suffer shame, and all her slain will lie fallen within her."
Jeremiah,51,48,Heaven and earth and everything in them will shout for joy over Babylon because the destroyers from the north will come against her. This is the LORD’s declaration.
Jeremiah,51,49,"Babylon must fall because of the slain of Israel, even as the slain of all the earth fell because of Babylon."
Jeremiah,51,50,"You who have escaped the sword, go and do not stand still! Remember the LORD from far away, and let Jerusalem come to your mind."
Jeremiah,51,51,We are ashamed because we have heard insults. Humiliation covers our faces because foreigners have entered the holy places of the LORD’s temple.
Jeremiah,51,52,"Therefore, look, the days are coming— this is the LORD’s declaration— when I will punish her carved images, and the wounded will groan throughout her land."
Jeremiah,51,53,"Even if Babylon should ascend to the heavens and fortify her tall fortresses, destroyers will come against her from Me. This is the LORD’s declaration."
Jeremiah,51,54,The sound of a cry from Babylon! The sound of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!
Jeremiah,51,55,"For the LORD is going to devastate Babylon; He will silence her mighty voice. Their waves roar like abundant waters; the tumult of their voice resounds,"
Jeremiah,51,56,"for a destroyer is coming against her, against Babylon. Her warriors will be captured, their bows shattered, for the LORD is a God of retribution; He will certainly repay."
Jeremiah,51,57,"I will make her princes and sages drunk, along with her governors, officials, and warriors. Then they will fall asleep forever and never wake up. This is the King’s declaration; Yahweh of Hosts is His name."

Jeremiah,51,59,"This is what Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah son of Neriah son of Mahseiah, the quartermaster, when he went to Babylon with King Zedekiah of Judah in the fourth year of Zedekiah’s reign."
Jeremiah,51,60,Jeremiah wrote on one scroll about all the disaster that would come to Babylon; all these words were written against Babylon.
Jeremiah,51,61,"Jeremiah told Seraiah, “When you get to Babylon, see that you read all these words aloud."
Jeremiah,51,62,"You must say, ‘LORD, You have threatened to cut off this place so that no one will live in it—man or beast. Indeed, it will remain desolate forever.’"
Jeremiah,51,63,"When you have finished reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates River."
Jeremiah,51,64,"Then say, ‘In the same way, Babylon will sink and never rise again because of the disaster I am bringing on her. They will grow weary.’” The words of Jeremiah end here."
Jeremiah,52,1,Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king and reigned 11 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah.
Jeremiah,52,2,Zedekiah did what was evil in the LORD’s sight just as Jehoiakim had done.
Jeremiah,52,3,"Because of the LORD’s anger, it came to the point in Jerusalem and Judah that He finally banished them from His presence. Nevertheless, Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,52,4,"In the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon advanced against Jerusalem with his entire army. They laid siege to the city and built a siege wall all around it."
Jeremiah,52,5,The city was under siege until King Zedekiah’s eleventh year.
Jeremiah,52,6,By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that the people of the land had no food.
Jeremiah,52,7,"Then the city was broken into, and all the warriors fled. They left the city by night by way of the gate between the two walls near the king’s garden, though the Chaldeans surrounded the city. They made their way along the route to the Arabah."
Jeremiah,52,8,The Chaldean army pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. Zedekiah’s entire army was scattered from him.
Jeremiah,52,9,"The Chaldeans seized the king and brought him to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him."

Jeremiah,52,12,"On the tenth day of the fifth month—which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon—Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, entered Jerusalem as the representative of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,52,13,"He burned the LORD’s temple, the king’s palace, all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the nobles."
Jeremiah,52,14,The whole Chaldean army with the commander of the guards tore down all the walls surrounding Jerusalem.
Jeremiah,52,15,"Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, deported some of the poorest of the people, as well as the rest of the people who were left in the city, the deserters who had defected to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the craftsmen."
Jeremiah,52,16,"But some of the poorest people of the land Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, left to be vinedressers and farmers."
Jeremiah,52,17,"Now the Chaldeans broke into pieces the bronze pillars for the LORD’s temple and the water carts and the bronze reservoir that were in the LORD’s temple, and carried all the bronze to Babylon."

Jeremiah,52,19,"The commander of the guards took away the bowls, firepans, sprinkling basins, pots, lampstands, pans, and drink offering bowls—whatever was gold or silver."
Jeremiah,52,20,"As for the two pillars, the one reservoir, and the 12 bronze bulls under the water carts that King Solomon had made for the LORD’s temple, the weight of the bronze of all these articles was beyond measure."
Jeremiah,52,21,"One pillar was 27 feet tall, had a circumference of 18 feet, was hollow—four fingers thick—"
Jeremiah,52,22,"and had a bronze capital on top of it. One capital, encircled by bronze latticework and pomegranates, stood 7½ feet high. The second pillar was the same, with pomegranates."
Jeremiah,52,23,Each capital had 96 pomegranates all around it. All the pomegranates around the latticework numbered 100.
Jeremiah,52,24,"The commander of the guards also took away Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest of the second rank, and the three doorkeepers."
Jeremiah,52,25,"From the city he took a court official who had been appointed over the warriors; seven trusted royal aides found in the city; the secretary of the commander of the army, who enlisted the people of the land for military duty; and 60 men from the common people who were found within the city."
Jeremiah,52,26,"Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah."
Jeremiah,52,27,The king of Babylon put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah went into exile from its land.
Jeremiah,52,28,"These are the people Nebuchadnezzar deported: in the seventh year, 3,023 Jews;"
Jeremiah,52,29,"in his eighteenth year, 832 people from Jerusalem;"
Jeremiah,52,30,"in Nebuchadnezzar’s twenty-third year, Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, deported 745 Jews. All together 4,600 people were deported."
Jeremiah,52,31,"On the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month of the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Judah’s King Jehoiachin, Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, pardoned King Jehoiachin of Judah and released him from prison."
Jeremiah,52,32,He spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the thrones of the kings who were with him in Babylon.
Jeremiah,52,33,"So Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes, and he dined regularly in the presence of the king of Babylon for the rest of his life."
Jeremiah,52,34,"As for his allowance, a regular allowance was given to him by the king of Babylon, a portion for each day until the day of his death, for the rest of his life."

Lamentations,4,3,"ג Gimel Even jackals offer their breasts to nurse their young, but my dear people have become cruel like ostriches in the wilderness."
Lamentations,4,4,"ד Dalet The nursing infant’s tongue clings to the roof of his mouth from thirst. Little children beg for bread, but no one gives them any."
Lamentations,4,5,ה He Those who used to eat delicacies are destitute in the streets; those who were reared in purple garments huddle in garbage heaps.

Lamentations,4,15,"ס Samek “Stay away! Unclean!” people shouted at them. “Away, away! Don’t touch us!” So they wandered aimlessly. It was said among the nations, “They can stay here no longer.”"
Lamentations,4,16,פ Pe The LORD Himself has scattered them; He regards them no more. The priests are not respected; the elders find no favor.

Ezekiel,1,1,"In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, while I was among the exiles by the Chebar Canal, the heavens opened and I saw visions of God."
Ezekiel,1,2,On the fifth day of the month—it was the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s exile—
Ezekiel,1,3,"the word of the LORD came directly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the Chebar Canal. And the LORD’s hand was on him there."
Ezekiel,1,4,"I looked and there was a whirlwind coming from the north, a great cloud with fire flashing back and forth and brilliant light all around it. In the center of the fire, there was a gleam like amber."
Ezekiel,1,5,"The form of four living creatures came from it. And this was their appearance: They had human form,"
Ezekiel,1,6,but each of them had four faces and four wings.
Ezekiel,1,7,"Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the hooves of a calf, sparkling like the gleam of polished bronze."
Ezekiel,1,8,They had human hands under their wings on their four sides. All four of them had faces and wings.
Ezekiel,1,9,Their wings were touching. The creatures did not turn as they moved; each one went straight ahead.
Ezekiel,1,10,"The form of each of their faces was that of a man, and each of the four had the face of a lion on the right, the face of an ox on the left, and the face of an eagle."
Ezekiel,1,11,That is what their faces were like. Their wings were spread upward; each had two wings touching that of another and two wings covering its body.
Ezekiel,1,12,"Each creature went straight ahead. Wherever the Spirit wanted to go, they went without turning as they moved."
Ezekiel,1,13,"The form of the living creatures was like the appearance of burning coals of fire and torches. Fire was moving back and forth between the living creatures; it was bright, with lightning coming out of it."
Ezekiel,1,14,The creatures were darting back and forth like flashes of lightning.
Ezekiel,1,15,"When I looked at the living creatures, there was one wheel on the ground beside each creature that had four faces."
Ezekiel,1,16,"The appearance of the wheels and their craftsmanship was like the gleam of beryl, and all four had the same form. Their appearance and craftsmanship was like a wheel within a wheel."
Ezekiel,1,17,"When they moved, they went in any of the four directions, without pivoting as they moved."
Ezekiel,1,18,Their rims were large and frightening. Each of their four rims were full of eyes all around.
Ezekiel,1,19,"So when the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them, and when the creatures rose from the earth, the wheels also rose."
Ezekiel,1,20,"Wherever the Spirit wanted to go, the creatures went in the direction the Spirit was moving. The wheels rose alongside them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels."
Ezekiel,1,21,"When the creatures moved, the wheels moved; when the creatures stood still, the wheels stood still; and when the creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose alongside them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels."
Ezekiel,1,22,"The shape of an expanse, with a gleam like awe-inspiring crystal, was spread out over the heads of the living creatures."
Ezekiel,1,23,And under the expanse their wings extended one toward another. Each of them also had two wings covering their bodies.
Ezekiel,1,24,"When they moved, I heard the sound of their wings like the roar of mighty waters, like the voice of the Almighty, and a sound of commotion like the noise of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings."
Ezekiel,1,25,"A voice came from above the expanse over their heads; when they stood still, they lowered their wings."
Ezekiel,1,26,The shape of a throne with the appearance of sapphire stone was above the expanse. There was a form with the appearance of a human on the throne high above.
Ezekiel,1,27,"From what seemed to be His waist up, I saw a gleam like amber, with what looked like fire enclosing it all around. From what seemed to be His waist down, I also saw what looked like fire. There was a brilliant light all around Him."
Ezekiel,1,28,"The appearance of the brilliant light all around was like that of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day. This was the appearance of the form of the LORD’s glory. When I saw it, I fell facedown and heard a voice speaking."
Ezekiel,2,1,"He said to me, “Son of man, stand up on your feet and I will speak with you.”"
Ezekiel,2,2,"As He spoke to me, the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet, and I listened to the One who was speaking to me."
Ezekiel,2,3,"He said to me: “Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to the rebellious pagans who have rebelled against Me. The Israelites and their ancestors have transgressed against Me to this day."
Ezekiel,2,4,"The children are obstinate and hardhearted. I am sending you to them, and you must say to them, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says.’"
Ezekiel,2,5,Whether they listen or refuse to listen—for they are a rebellious house—they will know that a prophet has been among them.
Ezekiel,2,6,"“But you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words, though briers and thorns are beside you and you live among scorpions. Don’t be afraid of their words or be discouraged by the look on their faces, for they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,2,7,"But speak My words to them whether they listen or refuse to listen, for they are rebellious."
Ezekiel,2,8,"“And you, son of man, listen to what I tell you: Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you.”"
Ezekiel,2,9,"So I looked and saw a hand reaching out to me, and there was a written scroll in it."
Ezekiel,2,10,"When He unrolled it before me, it was written on the front and back; words of lamentation, mourning, and woe were written on it."
Ezekiel,3,1,"He said to me: “Son of man, eat what you find here. Eat this scroll, then go and speak to the house of Israel.”"
Ezekiel,3,2,"So I opened my mouth, and He fed me the scroll."
Ezekiel,3,3,"“Son of man,” He said to me, “eat and fill your stomach with this scroll I am giving you.” So I ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth."
Ezekiel,3,4,"Then He said to me: “Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak My words to them."
Ezekiel,3,5,For you are not being sent to a people of unintelligible speech or difficult language but to the house of Israel.
Ezekiel,3,6,"You are not being sent to many peoples of unintelligible speech or difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. No doubt, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you."
Ezekiel,3,7,But the house of Israel will not want to listen to you because they do not want to listen to Me. For the whole house of Israel is hardheaded and hardhearted.
Ezekiel,3,8,"Look, I have made your face as hard as their faces and your forehead as hard as their foreheads."
Ezekiel,3,9,"I have made your forehead like a diamond, harder than flint. Don’t be afraid of them or discouraged by the look on their faces, even though they are a rebellious house.”"
Ezekiel,3,10,"Next He said to me: “Son of man, listen carefully to all My words that I speak to you and take them to heart."
Ezekiel,3,11,"Go to your people, the exiles, and speak to them. Tell them, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says,’ whether they listen or refuse to listen.”"
Ezekiel,3,12,"The Spirit then lifted me up, and I heard a great rumbling sound behind me—praise the glory of the LORD in His place!—"
Ezekiel,3,13,"with the sound of the living creatures’ wings brushing against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them, a great rumbling sound."
Ezekiel,3,14,"So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away. I left in bitterness and in an angry spirit, and the LORD’s hand was on me powerfully."
Ezekiel,3,15,"I came to the exiles at Tel-abib, who were living by the Chebar Canal, and I sat there among them stunned for seven days."
Ezekiel,3,16,Now at the end of seven days the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,3,17,"“Son of man, I have made you a watchman over the house of Israel. When you hear a word from My mouth, give them a warning from Me."
Ezekiel,3,18,"If I say to the wicked person, ‘You will surely die,’ but you do not warn him—you don’t speak out to warn him about his wicked way in order to save his life—that wicked person will die for his iniquity. Yet I will hold you responsible for his blood."
Ezekiel,3,19,"But if you warn a wicked person and he does not turn from his wickedness or his wicked way, he will die for his iniquity, but you will have saved your life."
Ezekiel,3,20,"Now if a righteous person turns from his righteousness and practices iniquity, and I put a stumbling block in front of him, he will die. If you did not warn him, he will die because of his sin and the righteous acts he did will not be remembered. Yet I will hold you responsible for his blood."
Ezekiel,3,21,"But if you warn the righteous person that he should not sin, and he does not sin, he will indeed live because he listened to your warning, and you will have saved your life.”"
Ezekiel,3,22,"Then the hand of the LORD was on me there, and He said to me, “Get up, go out to the plain, and I will speak with you there.”"
Ezekiel,3,23,"So I got up and went out to the plain. The LORD’s glory was present there, like the glory I had seen by the Chebar Canal, and I fell facedown."
Ezekiel,3,24,"The Spirit entered me and set me on my feet. He spoke with me and said: “Go, shut yourself inside your house."
Ezekiel,3,25,"And you, son of man, they will put ropes on you and bind you with them so you cannot go out among them."
Ezekiel,3,26,"I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, and you will be mute and unable to rebuke them, for they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,3,27,"But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you will say to them, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says.’ Let the one who listens, listen, and let the one who refuses, refuse—for they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,4,1,"“Now you, son of man, take a brick, set it in front of you, and draw the city of Jerusalem on it."
Ezekiel,4,2,"Then lay siege against it: construct a siege wall, build a ramp, pitch military camps, and place battering rams against it on all sides."
Ezekiel,4,3,"Take an iron plate and set it up as an iron wall between yourself and the city. Turn your face toward it so that it is under siege, and besiege it. This will be a sign for the house of Israel."
Ezekiel,4,4,“Then lie down on your left side and place the iniquity of the house of Israel on it. You will bear their iniquity for the number of days you lie on your side.
Ezekiel,4,5,"For I have assigned you the years of their iniquity according to the number of days you lie down, 390 days; so you will bear the iniquity of the house of Israel."
Ezekiel,4,6,"When you have completed these days, lie down again, but on your right side, and bear the iniquity of the house of Judah. I have assigned you 40 days, a day for each year."
Ezekiel,4,7,"You must turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem with your arm bared, and prophesy against it."
Ezekiel,4,8,Be aware that I will put cords on you so you cannot turn from side to side until you have finished the days of your siege.
Ezekiel,4,9,"“Also take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt. Put them in a single container and make them into bread for yourself. You are to eat it during the number of days you lie on your side, 390 days."
Ezekiel,4,10,The food you eat each day will be eight ounces by weight; you will eat it from time to time.
Ezekiel,4,11,"You are also to drink water by measure, a sixth of a gallon, which you will drink from time to time."
Ezekiel,4,12,You will eat it as you would a barley cake and bake it over dried human excrement in their sight.”
Ezekiel,4,13,"The LORD said, “This is how the Israelites will eat their bread—ceremonially unclean—among the nations where I will banish them.”"
Ezekiel,4,14,"But I said, “Oh, Lord GOD, I have never been defiled. From my youth until now I have not eaten anything that died naturally or was mauled by wild beasts. And impure meat has never entered my mouth.”"
Ezekiel,4,15,"He replied to me, “Look, I will let you use cow dung instead of human excrement, and you can make your bread over that.”"
Ezekiel,4,16,"Then He said to me, “Son of man, I am going to cut off the supply of bread in Jerusalem. They will anxiously eat bread rationed by weight and in dread drink water by measure."
Ezekiel,4,17,So they will lack bread and water; everyone will be devastated and waste away because of their iniquity.
Ezekiel,5,1,"“Now you, son of man, take a sharp sword, use it as you would a barber’s razor, and shave your head and beard. Then take a set of scales and divide the hair."
Ezekiel,5,2,"You are to burn up a third of it in the city when the days of the siege have ended; you are to take a third and slash it with the sword all around the city; and you are to scatter a third to the wind, for I will draw a sword to chase after them."
Ezekiel,5,3,But you are to take a few strands from the hair and secure them in the folds of your robe.
Ezekiel,5,4,"Take some more of them, throw them into the fire, and burn them in it. A fire will spread from it to the whole house of Israel."
Ezekiel,5,5,"“This is what the Lord GOD says: I have set this Jerusalem in the center of the nations, with countries all around her."
Ezekiel,5,6,"But she has rebelled against My ordinances with more wickedness than the nations, and against My statutes more than the countries that surround her. For her people have rejected My ordinances and have not walked in My statutes."
Ezekiel,5,7,"“Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says: Because you have been more insubordinate than the nations around you—you have not walked in My statutes or kept My ordinances; you have not even kept the ordinances of the nations around you—"
Ezekiel,5,8,"therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says: See, I am against you, Jerusalem, and I will execute judgments within you in the sight of the nations."
Ezekiel,5,9,"Because of all your detestable practices, I will do to you what I have never done before and what I will never do again."
Ezekiel,5,10,"As a result, fathers will eat their sons within Jerusalem, and sons will eat their fathers. I will execute judgments against you and scatter all your survivors to every direction of the wind."
Ezekiel,5,11,"“Therefore, as I live”—this is the declaration of the Lord GOD—“I am going to cut you off and show you no pity, because you have defiled My sanctuary with all your detestable practices and abominations. Yes, I will not spare you."
Ezekiel,5,12,"A third of your people will die by plague and be consumed by famine within you; a third will fall by the sword all around you; and I will scatter a third to every direction of the wind, and I will draw a sword to chase after them."
Ezekiel,5,13,"When My anger is spent and I have vented My wrath on them, I will be appeased. Then after I have spent My wrath on them, they will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken in My jealousy."
Ezekiel,5,14,"“I will make you a ruin and a disgrace among the nations around you, in the sight of everyone who passes by."
Ezekiel,5,15,"So you will be a disgrace and a taunt, a warning and a horror, to the nations around you when I execute judgments against you in anger, wrath, and furious rebukes. I, Yahweh, have spoken."
Ezekiel,5,16,"When I shoot deadly arrows of famine at them, arrows for destruction that I will send to destroy you, inhabitants of Jerusalem, I will intensify the famine against you and cut off your supply of bread."
Ezekiel,5,17,"I will send famine and dangerous animals against you. They will leave you childless, Jerusalem. Plague and bloodshed will sweep through you, and I will bring a sword against you. I, Yahweh, have spoken.”"
Ezekiel,6,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,6,2,"“Son of man, turn your face toward the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them."
Ezekiel,6,3,"You are to say: Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD! This is what the Lord GOD says to the mountains and the hills, to the ravines and the valleys: I am about to bring a sword against you, and I will destroy your high places."
Ezekiel,6,4,Your altars will be desolated and your incense altars smashed. I will throw down your slain in front of your idols.
Ezekiel,6,5,I will lay the corpses of the Israelites in front of their idols and scatter your bones around your altars.
Ezekiel,6,6,"Wherever you live the cities will be in ruins and the high places will be desolate, so that your altars will lie in ruins and be desecrated, your idols smashed and obliterated, your incense altars cut down, and your works wiped out."
Ezekiel,6,7,"The slain will fall among you, and you will know that I am Yahweh."
Ezekiel,6,8,"“Yet I will leave a remnant when you are scattered among the nations, for throughout the countries there will be some of you who will escape the sword."
Ezekiel,6,9,"Then your survivors will remember Me among the nations where they are taken captive, how I was crushed by their promiscuous hearts that turned away from Me and by their eyes that lusted after their idols. They will loathe themselves because of the evil things they did, their detestable practices of every kind."
Ezekiel,6,10,And they will know that I am the LORD; I did not threaten to bring this disaster on them without a reason.
Ezekiel,6,11,"“This is what the Lord GOD says: Clap your hands, stamp your feet, and cry out over all the evil and detestable practices of the house of Israel, who will fall by the sword, famine, and plague."
Ezekiel,6,12,The one who is far off will die by plague; the one who is near will fall by the sword; and the one who remains and is spared will die of famine. In this way I will exhaust My wrath on them.
Ezekiel,6,13,"You will all know that I am Yahweh when their slain lie among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, and under every green tree and every leafy oak—the places where they offered pleasing aromas to all their idols."
Ezekiel,6,14,"I will stretch out My hand against them, and wherever they live I will make the land a desolate waste, from the wilderness to Diblah. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.”"
Ezekiel,7,1,And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,7,2,"“Son of man, this is what the Lord GOD says to the land of Israel: An end! The end has come on the four corners of the land."
Ezekiel,7,3,The end is now upon you; I will send My anger against you and judge you according to your ways. I will punish you for all your detestable practices.
Ezekiel,7,4,"I will not look on you with pity or spare you, but I will punish you for your ways and for your detestable practices within you. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.”"
Ezekiel,7,5,"This is what the Lord GOD says: Look, one disaster after another is coming!"
Ezekiel,7,6,"An end has come; the end has come! It has awakened against you. Look, it is coming!"
Ezekiel,7,7,"Doom has come on you, inhabitants of the land. The time has come; the day is near. There will be panic on the mountains and not celebration."
Ezekiel,7,8,I will pour out My wrath on you very soon; I will exhaust My anger against you and judge you according to your ways. I will punish you for all your detestable practices.
Ezekiel,7,9,"I will not look on you with pity or spare you. I will punish you for your ways and for your detestable practices within you. Then you will know that it is I, Yahweh, who strikes."
Ezekiel,7,10,"Look, the day is coming! Doom has gone out. The rod has blossomed; arrogance has bloomed."
Ezekiel,7,11,"Violence has grown into a rod of wickedness. None of them will remain: none of their multitude, none of their wealth, and none of the eminent among them."
Ezekiel,7,12,"The time has come; the day has arrived. Let the buyer not rejoice and the seller not mourn, for wrath is on all her masses."
Ezekiel,7,13,"The seller will certainly not return to what was sold as long as he and the buyer remain alive. For the vision concerning all its people will not be revoked, and none of them will preserve his life because of his iniquity."
Ezekiel,7,14,"They have blown the trumpet and prepared everything, but no one goes to war, for My wrath is on all her masses."
Ezekiel,7,15,"The sword is on the outside; plague and famine are on the inside. Whoever is in the field will die by the sword, and famine and plague will devour whoever is in the city."
Ezekiel,7,16,"The survivors among them will escape and live on the mountains like doves of the valley, all of them moaning, each over his own iniquity."
Ezekiel,7,17,"All their hands will become weak, and all their knees will turn to water."
Ezekiel,7,18,"They will put on sackcloth, and horror will overwhelm them. Shame will cover all their faces, and all their heads will be bald."
Ezekiel,7,19,"They will throw their silver into the streets, and their gold will seem like something filthy. Their silver and gold will be unable to save them in the day of the LORD’s wrath. They will not satisfy their appetites or fill their stomachs, for these were the stumbling blocks that brought about their iniquity."
Ezekiel,7,20,"He appointed His beautiful ornaments for majesty, but they made their abhorrent images from them, their detestable things. Therefore, I have made these into something filthy for them."
Ezekiel,7,21,"I will hand these things over to foreigners as plunder and to the wicked of the earth as spoil, and they will profane them."
Ezekiel,7,22,I will turn My face from the wicked as they profane My treasured place. Violent men will enter it and profane it.
Ezekiel,7,23,"Forge the chain, for the land is filled with crimes of bloodshed, and the city is filled with violence."
Ezekiel,7,24,"So I will bring the most evil of nations to take possession of their houses. I will put an end to the pride of the strong, and their sacred places will be profaned."
Ezekiel,7,25,"Anguish is coming! They will seek peace, but there will be none."
Ezekiel,7,26,"Disaster after disaster will come, and there will be rumor after rumor. Then they will seek a vision from a prophet, but instruction will perish from the priests and counsel from the elders."
Ezekiel,7,27,"The king will mourn; the prince will be clothed in grief; and the hands of the people of the land will tremble. I will deal with them according to their own conduct, and I will judge them by their own standards. Then they will know that I am Yahweh."
Ezekiel,8,1,"In the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, I was sitting in my house and the elders of Judah were sitting in front of me, and there the hand of the Lord GOD came down on me."
Ezekiel,8,2,"I looked, and there was a form that had the appearance of a man. From what seemed to be His waist down was fire, and from His waist up was something that looked bright, like the gleam of amber."
Ezekiel,8,3,"He stretched out what appeared to be a hand and took me by the hair of my head. Then the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and carried me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the inner gate that faces north, where the offensive statue that provokes jealousy was located."
Ezekiel,8,4,"I saw the glory of the God of Israel there, like the vision I had seen in the plain."
Ezekiel,8,5,"The LORD said to me, “Son of man, look toward the north.” I looked to the north, and there was this offensive statue north of the altar gate, at the entrance."
Ezekiel,8,6,"He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing here, more detestable things that the house of Israel is committing, so that I must depart from My sanctuary? You will see even more detestable things.”"
Ezekiel,8,7,"Then He brought me to the entrance of the court, and when I looked there was a hole in the wall."
Ezekiel,8,8,"He said to me, “Son of man, dig through the wall.” So I dug through the wall, and there was a doorway."
Ezekiel,8,9,"He said to me, “Go in and see the terrible and detestable things they are committing here.”"
Ezekiel,8,10,"I went in and looked, and there engraved all around the wall was every form of detestable thing, crawling creatures and beasts, as well as all the idols of the house of Israel."
Ezekiel,8,11,"Seventy elders from the house of Israel were standing before them, with Jaazaniah son of Shaphan standing among them. Each had a firepan in his hand, and a fragrant cloud of incense was rising up."
Ezekiel,8,12,"Then He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the darkness, each at the shrine of his idol? For they are saying, ‘The LORD does not see us. The LORD has abandoned the land.’”"
Ezekiel,8,13,"Again He said to me, “You will see even more detestable things, which they are committing.”"
Ezekiel,8,14,"So He brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the LORD’s house, and I saw women sitting there weeping for Tammuz."
Ezekiel,8,15,"And He said to me, “Do you see this, son of man? You will see even more detestable things than these.”"
Ezekiel,8,16,"So He brought me to the inner court of the LORD’s house, and there were about 25 men at the entrance of the LORD’s temple, between the portico and the altar, with their backs to the LORD’s temple and their faces turned to the east. They were bowing to the east in worship of the sun."
Ezekiel,8,17,"And He said to me, “Do you see this, son of man? Is it not enough for the house of Judah to commit the detestable things they are practicing here, that they must also fill the land with violence and repeatedly provoke Me to anger, even putting the branch to their nose?"
Ezekiel,8,18,"Therefore I will respond with wrath. I will not show pity or spare them. Though they cry out in My ears with a loud voice, I will not listen to them.”"
Ezekiel,9,1,"Then He called to me directly with a loud voice, “Come near, executioners of the city, each of you with a destructive weapon in his hand.”"
Ezekiel,9,2,"And I saw six men coming from the direction of the Upper Gate, which faces north, each with a war club in his hand. There was another man among them, clothed in linen, with writing equipment at his side. They came and stood beside the bronze altar."
Ezekiel,9,3,"Then the glory of the God of Israel rose from above the cherub where it had been, to the threshold of the temple. He called to the man clothed in linen with the writing equipment at his side."
Ezekiel,9,4,"“Pass throughout the city of Jerusalem,” the LORD said to him, “and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and groan over all the detestable practices committed in it.”"
Ezekiel,9,5,"He spoke as I listened to the others, “Pass through the city after him and start killing; do not show pity or spare them!"
Ezekiel,9,6,"Slaughter the old men, the young men and women, as well as the older women and little children, but do not come near anyone who has the mark. Now begin at My sanctuary.” So they began with the elders who were in front of the temple."
Ezekiel,9,7,"Then He said to them, “Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go!” So they went out killing people in the city."
Ezekiel,9,8,"While they were killing, I was left alone. And I fell facedown and cried out, “Oh, Lord GOD! Are You going to destroy the entire remnant of Israel when You pour out Your wrath on Jerusalem?”"
Ezekiel,9,9,"He answered me: “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is extremely great; the land is full of bloodshed, and the city full of perversity. For they say, ‘The LORD has abandoned the land; He does not see.’"
Ezekiel,9,10,"But as for Me, I will not show pity or spare them. I will bring their actions down on their own heads.”"
Ezekiel,9,11,"Then the man clothed in linen with the writing equipment at his side reported back, “I have done as You commanded me.”"
Ezekiel,10,1,"Then I looked, and there above the expanse over the heads of the cherubim was something like sapphire stone resembling the shape of a throne that appeared above them."
Ezekiel,10,2,"The LORD spoke to the man clothed in linen and said, “Go inside the wheelwork beneath the cherubim. Fill your hands with hot coals from among the cherubim and scatter them over the city.” So he went in as I watched."
Ezekiel,10,3,"Now the cherubim were standing to the south of the temple when the man went in, and the cloud filled the inner court."
Ezekiel,10,4,"Then the glory of the LORD rose from above the cherub to the threshold of the temple. The temple was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightness of the LORD’s glory."
Ezekiel,10,5,The sound of the cherubim’s wings could be heard as far as the outer court; it was like the voice of God Almighty when He speaks.
Ezekiel,10,6,"After the LORD commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take fire from inside the wheelwork, from among the cherubim,” the man went in and stood beside a wheel."
Ezekiel,10,7,"Then the cherub reached out his hand to the fire that was among them. He took some, and put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who took it and went out."
Ezekiel,10,8,The cherubim appeared to have the form of human hands under their wings.
Ezekiel,10,9,"I looked, and there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside each cherub. The luster of the wheels was like the gleam of beryl."
Ezekiel,10,10,"In appearance, all four had the same form, like a wheel within a wheel."
Ezekiel,10,11,"When they moved, they would go in any of the four directions, without pivoting as they moved. But wherever the head faced, they would go in that direction, without pivoting as they went."
Ezekiel,10,12,"Their entire bodies, including their backs, hands, wings, and the wheels that the four of them had, were full of eyes all around."
Ezekiel,10,13,As I listened the wheels were called “the wheelwork.”
Ezekiel,10,14,"Each one had four faces: the first face was that of a cherub, the second that of a man, the third that of a lion, and the fourth that of an eagle."
Ezekiel,10,15,The cherubim ascended; these were the living creatures I had seen by the Chebar Canal.
Ezekiel,10,16,"When the cherubim moved, the wheels moved beside them, and when they lifted their wings to rise from the earth, even then the wheels did not veer away from them."
Ezekiel,10,17,"When the cherubim stood still, the wheels stood still, and when they ascended, the wheels ascended with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in them."
Ezekiel,10,18,Then the glory of the LORD moved away from the threshold of the temple and stood above the cherubim.
Ezekiel,10,19,"The cherubim lifted their wings and ascended from the earth right before my eyes; the wheels were beside them as they went. The glory of the God of Israel was above them, and it stood at the entrance to the eastern gate of the LORD’s house."
Ezekiel,10,20,"These were the living creatures I had seen beneath the God of Israel by the Chebar Canal, and I recognized that they were cherubim."
Ezekiel,10,21,"Each had four faces and each had four wings, with the form of human hands under their wings."
Ezekiel,10,22,Their faces looked like the same faces I had seen by the Chebar Canal. Each creature went straight ahead.
Ezekiel,11,1,"The Spirit then lifted me up and brought me to the eastern gate of the LORD’s house, which faces east, and at the gate’s entrance were 25 men. Among them I saw Jaazaniah son of Azzur, and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people."
Ezekiel,11,2,"The LORD said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who plan evil and give wicked advice in this city."
Ezekiel,11,3,"They are saying, ‘Isn’t the time near to build houses? The city is the pot, and we are the meat.’"
Ezekiel,11,4,"Therefore, prophesy against them. Prophesy, son of man!”"
Ezekiel,11,5,"Then the Spirit of the LORD came on me, and He told me, “You are to say: This is what the LORD says: That is what you are thinking, house of Israel; and I know the thoughts that arise in your mind."
Ezekiel,11,6,"You have multiplied your slain in this city, filling its streets with the dead."
Ezekiel,11,7,"“Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says: The slain you have put within it are the meat, and the city is the pot, but I will remove you from it."
Ezekiel,11,8,"You fear the sword, so I will bring the sword against you.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,11,9,“I will bring you out of the city and hand you over to foreigners; I will execute judgments against you.
Ezekiel,11,10,"You will fall by the sword, and I will judge you at the border of Israel. Then you will know that I am Yahweh."
Ezekiel,11,11,"The city will not be a pot for you, and you will not be the meat within it. I will judge you at the border of Israel,"
Ezekiel,11,12,"so you will know that I am Yahweh, whose statutes you have not followed and whose ordinances you have not practiced. Instead, you have acted according to the ordinances of the nations around you.”"
Ezekiel,11,13,"Now while I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell facedown and cried out with a loud voice: “Oh, Lord GOD! Will You bring to an end the remnant of Israel?”"
Ezekiel,11,14,The word of the LORD came to me again:
Ezekiel,11,15,"“Son of man, your own relatives, those who have the right to redeem you, and the entire house of Israel, all of them, are those that the residents of Jerusalem have said this to, ‘Stay away from the LORD; this land has been given to us as a possession.’"
Ezekiel,11,16,"“Therefore say: This is what the Lord GOD says: Though I sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries, yet for a little while I have been a sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone."
Ezekiel,11,17,"“Therefore say: This is what the Lord GOD says: I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel."
Ezekiel,11,18,"“When they arrive there, they will remove all its detestable things and practices from it."
Ezekiel,11,19,"And I will give them one heart and put a new spirit within them; I will remove their heart of stone from their bodies and give them a heart of flesh,"
Ezekiel,11,20,"so they may follow My statutes, keep My ordinances, and practice them. Then they will be My people, and I will be their God."
Ezekiel,11,21,"But as for those whose hearts pursue their desire for detestable things and practices, I will bring their actions down on their own heads.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,11,22,"Then the cherubim, with the wheels beside them, lifted their wings, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them."
Ezekiel,11,23,The glory of the LORD rose up from within the city and stood on the mountain east of the city.
Ezekiel,11,24,"The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to Chaldea and to the exiles in a vision from the Spirit of God. After the vision I had seen left me,"
Ezekiel,11,25,I spoke to the exiles about all the things the LORD had shown me.
Ezekiel,12,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,12,2,"“Son of man, you are living among a rebellious house. They have eyes to see but do not see, and ears to hear but do not hear, for they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,12,3,"“Son of man, get your bags ready for exile and go into exile in their sight during the day. You will go into exile from your place to another place while they watch; perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,12,4,"During the day, bring out your bags like an exile’s bags while they look on. Then in the evening go out in their sight like those going into exile."
Ezekiel,12,5,"As they watch, dig through the wall and take the bags out through it."
Ezekiel,12,6,"And while they look on, lift the bags to your shoulder and take them out in the dark; cover your face so that you cannot see the land. For I have made you a sign to the house of Israel.”"
Ezekiel,12,7,"So I did just as I was commanded. In the daytime I brought out my bags like an exile’s bags. In the evening I dug through the wall by hand; I took them out in the dark, carrying them on my shoulder in their sight."
Ezekiel,12,8,Then the word of the LORD came to me in the morning:
Ezekiel,12,9,"“Son of man, hasn’t the house of Israel, that rebellious house, asked you, ‘What are you doing?’"
Ezekiel,12,10,Say to them: This is what the Lord GOD says: This oracle is about the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are living there.
Ezekiel,12,11,"You are to say, ‘I am a sign for you. Just as I have done, so it will be done to them; they will go into exile, into captivity.’"
Ezekiel,12,12,The prince who is among them will lift his bags to his shoulder in the dark and go out. They will dig through the wall to bring him out through it. He will cover his face so he cannot see the land with his eyes.
Ezekiel,12,13,"But I will spread My net over him, and he will be caught in My snare. I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, yet he will not see it, and he will die there."
Ezekiel,12,14,"I will also scatter all the attendants who surround him and all his troops to every direction of the wind, and I will draw a sword to chase after them."
Ezekiel,12,15,They will know that I am Yahweh when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them among the countries.
Ezekiel,12,16,"But I will spare a few of them from the sword, famine, and plague so they can tell about all their detestable practices among the nations where they go. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.”"
Ezekiel,12,17,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,12,18,"“Son of man, eat your bread with trembling and drink your water with shaking and anxiety."
Ezekiel,12,19,"Then say to the people of the land: This is what the Lord GOD says about the residents of Jerusalem in the land of Israel: They will eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water in dread, for their land will be stripped of everything in it because of the violence of all who live there."
Ezekiel,12,20,"The inhabited cities will be destroyed, and the land will become a desolation. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.”"
Ezekiel,12,21,Again the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,12,22,"“Son of man, what is this proverb you people have about the land of Israel, which goes: The days keep passing by, and every vision fails?"
Ezekiel,12,23,"Therefore say to them: This is what the Lord GOD says: I will put a stop to this proverb, and they will not use it again in Israel. But say to them: The days draw near, as well as the fulfillment of every vision."
Ezekiel,12,24,For there will no longer be any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel.
Ezekiel,12,25,"But I, Yahweh, will speak whatever message I will speak, and it will be done. It will no longer be delayed. For in your days, rebellious house, I will speak a message and bring it to pass.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,12,26,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,12,27,"“Son of man, notice that the house of Israel is saying, ‘The vision that he sees concerns many years from now; he prophesies about distant times.’"
Ezekiel,12,28,Therefore say to them: This is what the Lord GOD says: None of My words will be delayed any longer. The message I speak will be fulfilled.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel,13,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,13,2,"“Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who are prophesying. Say to those who prophesy out of their own imagination: Hear the word of the LORD!"
Ezekiel,13,3,This is what the Lord GOD says: Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing.
Ezekiel,13,4,"Your prophets, Israel, are like jackals among ruins."
Ezekiel,13,5,You did not go up to the gaps or restore the wall around the house of Israel so that it might stand in battle on the day of the LORD.
Ezekiel,13,6,"They see false visions and speak lying divinations. They claim, ‘This is the LORD’s declaration,’ when the LORD did not send them, yet they wait for the fulfillment of their message."
Ezekiel,13,7,"Didn’t you see a false vision and speak a lying divination when you proclaimed, ‘This is the LORD’s declaration,’ even though I had not spoken?"
Ezekiel,13,8,"“Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says: I am against you because you have spoken falsely and had lying visions.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,13,9,"“My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and speak lying divinations. They will not be present in the fellowship of My people or be recorded in the register of the house of Israel, and they will not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh."
Ezekiel,13,10,"“Since they have led My people astray saying, ‘Peace,’ when there is no peace, for when someone builds a wall they plaster it with whitewash,"
Ezekiel,13,11,"therefore, tell those who plaster it that it will fall. Torrential rain will come, and I will send hailstones plunging down, and a windstorm will be released."
Ezekiel,13,12,"Now when the wall has fallen, will you not be asked, ‘Where is the coat of whitewash that you put on it?’"
Ezekiel,13,13,"“So this is what the Lord GOD says: I will release a windstorm in My wrath. Torrential rain will come in My anger, and hailstones will fall in destructive fury."
Ezekiel,13,14,"I will tear down the wall you plastered with whitewash and knock it to the ground so that its foundation is exposed. The city will fall, and you will be destroyed within it. Then you will know that I am Yahweh."
Ezekiel,13,15,"After I exhaust My wrath against the wall and against those who plaster it with whitewash, I will say to you: The wall is no more and neither are those who plastered it—"
Ezekiel,13,16,those prophets of Israel who prophesied to Jerusalem and saw a vision of peace for her when there was no peace.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel,13,17,"“Now, son of man, turn toward the women of your people who prophesy out of their own imagination. Prophesy against them"
Ezekiel,13,18,and say: This is what the Lord GOD says: Woe to the women who sew magic bands on the wrist of every hand and who make veils for the heads of people of every height in order to ensnare lives. Will you ensnare the lives of My people but preserve your own?
Ezekiel,13,19,"You profane Me in front of My people for handfuls of barley and scraps of bread; you kill those who should not die and spare those who should not live, when you lie to My people, who listen to lies."
Ezekiel,13,20,"“Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says: I am against your magic bands that you ensnare people with like birds, and I will tear them from your arms. I will free the people you have ensnared like birds."
Ezekiel,13,21,"I will also tear off your veils and deliver My people from your hands, so that they will no longer be prey in your hands. Then you will know that I am Yahweh."
Ezekiel,13,22,"Because you have disheartened the righteous person with lies, even though I have not caused him grief, and because you have encouraged the wicked person not to turn from his evil way to save his life,"
Ezekiel,13,23,therefore you will no longer see false visions or practice divination. I will deliver My people from your hands. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.”
Ezekiel,14,1,Some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat down in front of me.
Ezekiel,14,2,Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,14,3,"“Son of man, these men have set up idols in their hearts and have put sinful stumbling blocks before their faces. Should I be consulted by them at all?"
Ezekiel,14,4,"“Therefore, speak to them and tell them: This is what the Lord GOD says: When anyone from the house of Israel sets up idols in his heart, puts a sinful stumbling block before his face, and then comes to the prophet, I, Yahweh, will answer him appropriately. I will answer him according to his many idols,"
Ezekiel,14,5,so that I may take hold of the house of Israel by their hearts. They are all estranged from Me because of their idols.
Ezekiel,14,6,"“Therefore, say to the house of Israel: This is what the Lord GOD says: Repent and turn away from your idols; turn your faces away from all your detestable things."
Ezekiel,14,7,"For when anyone from the house of Israel or from the foreigners who reside in Israel separates himself from Me, setting up idols in his heart and putting a sinful stumbling block before his face, and then comes to the prophet to inquire of Me, I, Yahweh, will answer him Myself."
Ezekiel,14,8,I will turn against that one and make him a sign and a proverb; I will cut him off from among My people. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.
Ezekiel,14,9,"“But if the prophet is deceived and speaks a message, it was I, Yahweh, who deceived that prophet. I will stretch out My hand against him and destroy him from among My people Israel."
Ezekiel,14,10,They will bear their punishment—the punishment of the one who inquires will be the same as that of the prophet—
Ezekiel,14,11,in order that the house of Israel may no longer stray from following Me and no longer defile themselves with all their transgressions. Then they will be My people and I will be their God.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel,14,12,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,14,13,"“Son of man, if a land sins against Me by acting faithlessly, and I stretch out My hand against it to cut off its supply of bread, to send famine through it, and to wipe out both man and animal from it,"
Ezekiel,14,14,"even if these three men—Noah, Daniel, and Job—were in it, they would deliver only themselves by their righteousness.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,14,15,"“If I allow dangerous animals to pass through the land and depopulate it so that it becomes desolate, with no one passing through it for fear of the animals,"
Ezekiel,14,16,"even if these three men were in it, as I live”—the declaration of the Lord GOD—“they could not deliver their sons or daughters. They alone would be delivered, but the land would be desolate."
Ezekiel,14,17,"“Or if I bring a sword against that land and say: Let a sword pass through it, so that I wipe out both man and animal from it,"
Ezekiel,14,18,"even if these three men were in it, as I live”—the declaration of the Lord GOD—“they could not deliver their sons or daughters, but they alone would be delivered."
Ezekiel,14,19,"“Or if I send a plague into that land and pour out My wrath on it with bloodshed to wipe out both man and animal from it,"
Ezekiel,14,20,"even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live”—the declaration of the Lord GOD—“they could not deliver their son or daughter. They would deliver only themselves by their righteousness."
Ezekiel,14,21,"“For this is what the Lord GOD says: How much worse will it be when I send My four devastating judgments against Jerusalem—sword, famine, dangerous animals, and plague—in order to wipe out both man and animal from it!"
Ezekiel,14,22,"Even so, there will be survivors left in it, sons and daughters who will be brought out. Indeed, they will come out to you, and you will observe their conduct and actions. Then you will be consoled about the devastation I have brought on Jerusalem, about all I have brought on it."
Ezekiel,14,23,"They will bring you consolation when you see their conduct and actions, and you will know that it was not without cause that I have done what I did to it.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,15,1,Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,15,2,"“Son of man, how does the wood of the vine, that branch among the trees of the forest, compare to any other wood?"
Ezekiel,15,3,Can wood be taken from it to make something useful? Or can anyone make a peg from it to hang things on?
Ezekiel,15,4,"In fact, it is put into the fire as fuel. The fire devours both of its ends, and the middle is charred. Can it be useful for anything?"
Ezekiel,15,5,Even when it was whole it could not be made into a useful object. How much less can it ever be made into anything useful when the fire has devoured it and it is charred!
Ezekiel,15,6,"“Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says: Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire as fuel, so I will give up the residents of Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,15,7,"I will turn against them. They may have escaped from the fire, but it will still consume them. And you will know that I am Yahweh when I turn against them."
Ezekiel,15,8,I will make the land desolate because they have acted unfaithfully.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel,16,1,The word of the LORD came to me again:
Ezekiel,16,2,"“Son of man, explain Jerusalem’s detestable practices to her."
Ezekiel,16,3,You are to say: This is what the Lord GOD says to Jerusalem: Your origin and your birth were in the land of the Canaanites. Your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite.
Ezekiel,16,4,"As for your birth, your umbilical cord wasn’t cut on the day you were born, and you weren’t washed clean with water. You were not rubbed with salt or wrapped in cloths."
Ezekiel,16,5,No one cared enough about you to do even one of these things out of compassion for you. But you were thrown out into the open field because you were despised on the day you were born.
Ezekiel,16,6,"“I passed by you and saw you lying in your blood, and I said to you as you lay in your blood: Live! Yes, I said to you as you lay in your blood: Live!"
Ezekiel,16,7,"I made you thrive like plants of the field. You grew up and matured and became very beautiful. Your breasts were formed and your hair grew, but you were stark naked."
Ezekiel,16,8,"“Then I passed by you and saw you, and you were indeed at the age for love. So I spread the edge of My garment over you and covered your nakedness. I pledged Myself to you, entered into a covenant with you, and you became Mine.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,16,9,"“I washed you with water, rinsed off your blood, and anointed you with oil."
Ezekiel,16,10,I clothed you in embroidered cloth and provided you with leather sandals. I also wrapped you in fine linen and covered you with silk.
Ezekiel,16,11,"I adorned you with jewelry, putting bracelets on your wrists and a chain around your neck."
Ezekiel,16,12,"I put a ring in your nose, earrings on your ears, and a beautiful tiara on your head."
Ezekiel,16,13,"So you were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing was made of fine linen, silk, and embroidered cloth. You ate fine flour, honey, and oil. You became extremely beautiful and attained royalty."
Ezekiel,16,14,"Your fame spread among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect through My splendor, which I had bestowed on you.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,16,15,“But you were confident in your beauty and acted like a prostitute because of your fame. You lavished your sexual favors on everyone who passed by. Your beauty became his.
Ezekiel,16,16,"You took some of your garments and made colorful high places for yourself, and you engaged in prostitution on them. These places should not have been built, and this should never have happened!"
Ezekiel,16,17,"You also took your beautiful jewelry made from the gold and silver I had given you, and you made male images so that you could engage in prostitution with them."
Ezekiel,16,18,"Then you took your embroidered garments to cover them, and set My oil and incense before them."
Ezekiel,16,19,"You also set before them as a pleasing aroma the food I gave you—the fine flour, oil, and honey that I fed you. That is what happened.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,16,20,“You even took your sons and daughters you bore to Me and sacrificed them to these images as food. Wasn’t your prostitution enough?
Ezekiel,16,21,You slaughtered My children and gave them up when you passed them through the fire to the images.
Ezekiel,16,22,"In all your detestable practices and acts of prostitution, you did not remember the days of your youth when you were stark naked and lying in your blood."
Ezekiel,16,23,"“Then after all your evil—Woe, woe to you!”—the declaration of the Lord GOD—"
Ezekiel,16,24,“you built yourself a mound and made yourself an elevated place in every square.
Ezekiel,16,25,You built your elevated place at the head of every street and turned your beauty into a detestable thing. You spread your legs to everyone who passed by and increased your prostitution.
Ezekiel,16,26,"You engaged in promiscuous acts with Egyptian men, your well-endowed neighbors, and increased your prostitution to provoke Me to anger."
Ezekiel,16,27,"“Therefore, I stretched out My hand against you and reduced your provisions. I gave you over to the desire of those who hate you, the Philistine women, who were embarrassed by your indecent behavior."
Ezekiel,16,28,"Then you engaged in prostitution with the Assyrian men because you were not satisfied. Even though you did this with them, you were still not satisfied."
Ezekiel,16,29,"So you extended your prostitution to Chaldea, the land of merchants, but you were not even satisfied with this!"
Ezekiel,16,30,"“How your heart was inflamed with lust”—the declaration of the Lord GOD—“when you did all these things, the acts of a brazen prostitute,"
Ezekiel,16,31,building your mound at the head of every street and making your elevated place in every square. But you were unlike a prostitute because you scorned payment.
Ezekiel,16,32,"You adulterous wife, who receives strangers instead of her husband!"
Ezekiel,16,33,"Men give gifts to all prostitutes, but you gave gifts to all your lovers. You bribed them to come to you from all around for your sexual favors."
Ezekiel,16,34,"So you were the opposite of other women in your acts of prostitution; no one solicited you. When you paid a fee instead of one being paid to you, you were the opposite."
Ezekiel,16,35,"“Therefore, you prostitute, hear the word of the LORD!"
Ezekiel,16,36,"This is what the Lord GOD says: Because your lust was poured out and your nakedness exposed by your acts of prostitution with your lovers, and because of all your detestable idols and the blood of your children that you gave to them,"
Ezekiel,16,37,I am therefore going to gather all the lovers you pleased—all those you loved as well as all those you hated. I will gather them against you from all around and expose your nakedness to them so they see you completely naked.
Ezekiel,16,38,I will judge you the way adulteresses and those who shed blood are judged. Then I will bring about your bloodshed in wrath and jealousy.
Ezekiel,16,39,"I will hand you over to them, and they will level your mounds and tear down your elevated places. They will strip off your clothes, take your beautiful jewelry, and leave you stark naked."
Ezekiel,16,40,They will bring a mob against you to stone you and cut you to pieces with their swords.
Ezekiel,16,41,"Then they will burn down your houses and execute judgments against you in the sight of many women. I will stop you from being a prostitute, and you will never again pay fees for lovers."
Ezekiel,16,42,"So I will satisfy My wrath against you, and My jealousy will turn away from you. Then I will be silent and no longer angry."
Ezekiel,16,43,"Because you did not remember the days of your youth but enraged Me with all these things, I will also bring your actions down on your own head.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD. “Haven’t you committed immoral acts in addition to all your detestable practices?"
Ezekiel,16,44,"“Look, everyone who uses proverbs will say this proverb about you: Like mother, like daughter."
Ezekiel,16,45,"You are the daughter of your mother, who despised her husband and children. You are the sister of your sisters, who despised their husbands and children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite."
Ezekiel,16,46,"Your older sister was Samaria, who lived with her daughters to the north of you, and your younger sister was Sodom, who lived with her daughters to the south of you."
Ezekiel,16,47,Didn’t you walk in their ways and do their detestable practices? It was only a short time before you behaved more corruptly than they did.
Ezekiel,16,48,“As I live”—the declaration of the Lord GOD—“your sister Sodom and her daughters have not behaved as you and your daughters have.
Ezekiel,16,49,"Now this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, plenty of food, and comfortable security, but didn’t support the poor and needy."
Ezekiel,16,50,"They were haughty and did detestable things before Me, so I removed them when I saw this."
Ezekiel,16,51,But Samaria did not commit even half your sins. You have multiplied your detestable practices beyond theirs and made your sisters appear righteous by all the detestable things you have committed.
Ezekiel,16,52,"You must also bear your disgrace, since you have been an advocate for your sisters. For they appear more righteous than you because of your sins, which you committed more abhorrently than they did. So you also, be ashamed and bear your disgrace, since you have made your sisters appear righteous."
Ezekiel,16,53,"“I will restore their fortunes, the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters and those of Samaria and her daughters. I will also restore your fortunes among them,"
Ezekiel,16,54,so you will bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all you did when you comforted them.
Ezekiel,16,55,"As for your sisters, Sodom and her daughters and Samaria and her daughters will return to their former state. You and your daughters will also return to your former state."
Ezekiel,16,56,"Didn’t you treat your sister Sodom as an object of scorn when you were proud,"
Ezekiel,16,57,"before your wickedness was exposed? It was like the time you were scorned by the daughters of Aram and all those around her, and by the daughters of the Philistines—those who treated you with contempt from every side."
Ezekiel,16,58,You yourself must bear the consequences of your indecency and detestable practices”—this is the LORD’s declaration.
Ezekiel,16,59,"“For this is what the Lord GOD says: I will deal with you according to what you have done, since you have despised the oath by breaking the covenant."
Ezekiel,16,60,"But I will remember the covenant I made with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you."
Ezekiel,16,61,"Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your older and younger sisters. I will give them to you as daughters, but not because of your covenant."
Ezekiel,16,62,"I will establish My covenant with you, and you will know that I am Yahweh,"
Ezekiel,16,63,"so that when I make atonement for all you have done, you will remember and be ashamed, and never open your mouth again because of your disgrace.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,17,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,17,2,"“Son of man, pose a riddle and speak a parable to the house of Israel."
Ezekiel,17,3,"You are to say: This is what the Lord GOD says: A great eagle with great wings, long pinions, and full plumage of many colors came to Lebanon and took the top of the cedar."
Ezekiel,17,4,"He plucked off its topmost shoot, brought it to the land of merchants, and set it in a city of traders."
Ezekiel,17,5,"Then he took some of the land’s seed and put it in a fertile field; he set it like a willow, a plant by abundant waters."
Ezekiel,17,6,"It sprouted and became a spreading vine, low in height with its branches turned toward him, yet its roots stayed under it. So it became a vine, produced branches, and sent out shoots."
Ezekiel,17,7,"But there was another great eagle with great wings and thick plumage. And this vine bent its roots toward him! It stretched out its branches to him from its planting bed, so that he might water it."
Ezekiel,17,8,"It had been planted in a good field by abundant waters in order to produce branches, bear fruit, and become a splendid vine."
Ezekiel,17,9,You are to say: This is what the Lord GOD says: Will it flourish? Will he not tear out its roots and strip off its fruit so that it shrivels? All its fresh leaves will wither! Great strength and many people will not be needed to pull it from its roots.
Ezekiel,17,10,"Even though it is planted, will it flourish? Won’t it completely wither when the east wind strikes it? It will wither on the bed where it sprouted.”"
Ezekiel,17,11,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,17,12,"“Now say to that rebellious house: Don’t you know what these things mean? Tell them: The king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, took its king and officials, and brought them back with him to Babylon."
Ezekiel,17,13,"He took one of the royal family and made a covenant with him, putting him under oath. Then he took away the leading men of the land,"
Ezekiel,17,14,so the kingdom might be humble and not exalt itself but might keep his covenant in order to endure.
Ezekiel,17,15,"However, this king revolted against him by sending his ambassadors to Egypt so they might give him horses and a large army. Will he flourish? Will the one who does such things escape? Can he break a covenant and still escape?"
Ezekiel,17,16,"“As I live”—this is the declaration of the Lord GOD—“he will die in Babylon, in the land of the king who put him on the throne, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke."
Ezekiel,17,17,"Pharaoh will not help him with his great army and vast horde in battle, when ramps are built and siege walls constructed to destroy many lives."
Ezekiel,17,18,He despised the oath by breaking the covenant. He did all these things even though he gave his hand in pledge. He will not escape!”
Ezekiel,17,19,"Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says: “As I live, I will bring down on his head My oath that he despised and My covenant that he broke."
Ezekiel,17,20,"I will spread My net over him, and he will be caught in My snare. I will bring him to Babylon and execute judgment on him there for the treachery he committed against Me."
Ezekiel,17,21,"All the fugitives among his troops will fall by the sword, and those who survive will be scattered to every direction of the wind. Then you will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken.”"
Ezekiel,17,22,"This is what the Lord GOD says: I will take a sprig from the lofty top of the cedar and plant it. I will pluck a tender sprig from its topmost shoots, and I will plant it on a high towering mountain."
Ezekiel,17,23,"I will plant it on Israel’s high mountain so that it may bear branches, produce fruit, and become a majestic cedar. Birds of every kind will nest under it, taking shelter in the shade of its branches."
Ezekiel,17,24,"Then all the trees of the field will know that I am Yahweh. I bring down the tall tree, and make the low tree tall. I cause the green tree to wither and make the withered tree thrive. I, Yahweh, have spoken and I will do it."
Ezekiel,18,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,18,2,"“What do you mean by using this proverb concerning the land of Israel: The fathers eat sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge?"
Ezekiel,18,3,As I live”—this is the declaration of the Lord GOD—“you will no longer use this proverb in Israel.
Ezekiel,18,4,"Look, every life belongs to Me. The life of the father is like the life of the son—both belong to Me. The person who sins is the one who will die."
Ezekiel,18,5,“Now suppose a man is righteous and does what is just and right:
Ezekiel,18,6,He does not eat at the mountain shrines or raise his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel. He does not defile his neighbor’s wife or come near a woman during her menstrual impurity.
Ezekiel,18,7,"He doesn’t oppress anyone but returns his collateral to the debtor. He does not commit robbery, but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with clothing."
Ezekiel,18,8,He doesn’t lend at interest or for profit but keeps his hand from wrongdoing and carries out true justice between men.
Ezekiel,18,9,"He follows My statutes and keeps My ordinances, acting faithfully. Such a person is righteous; he will certainly live.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,18,10,"“Now suppose the man has a violent son, who sheds blood and does any of these things,"
Ezekiel,18,11,"though the father has done none of them. Indeed, when the son eats at the mountain shrines and defiles his neighbor’s wife,"
Ezekiel,18,12,"and when he oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, and does not return collateral, and when he raises his eyes to the idols, commits detestable acts,"
Ezekiel,18,13,"and lends at interest or for profit, will he live? He will not live! Since he has committed all these detestable acts, he will certainly die. His blood will be on him."
Ezekiel,18,14,"“Now suppose he has a son who sees all the sins his father has committed, and though he sees them, he does not do likewise."
Ezekiel,18,15,He does not eat at the mountain shrines or raise his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel. He does not defile his neighbor’s wife.
Ezekiel,18,16,"He doesn’t oppress anyone, hold collateral, or commit robbery. He gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with clothing."
Ezekiel,18,17,"He keeps his hand from harming the poor, not taking interest or profit on a loan. He practices My ordinances and follows My statutes. Such a person will not die for his father’s iniquity. He will certainly live."
Ezekiel,18,18,"“As for his father, he will die for his own iniquity because he practiced fraud, robbed his brother, and did what was wrong among his people."
Ezekiel,18,19,"But you may ask, ‘Why doesn’t the son suffer punishment for the father’s iniquity?’ Since the son has done what is just and right, carefully observing all My statutes, he will certainly live."
Ezekiel,18,20,"The person who sins is the one who will die. A son won’t suffer punishment for the father’s iniquity, and a father won’t suffer punishment for the son’s iniquity. The righteousness of the righteous person will be on him, and the wickedness of the wicked person will be on him."
Ezekiel,18,21,"“Now if the wicked person turns from all the sins he has committed, keeps all My statutes, and does what is just and right, he will certainly live; he will not die."
Ezekiel,18,22,None of the transgressions he has committed will be held against him. He will live because of the righteousness he has practiced.
Ezekiel,18,23,"Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked?” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD. “Instead, don’t I take pleasure when he turns from his ways and lives?"
Ezekiel,18,24,"But when a righteous person turns from his righteousness and practices iniquity, committing the same detestable acts that the wicked do, will he live? None of the righteous acts he did will be remembered. He will die because of the treachery he has engaged in and the sin he has committed."
Ezekiel,18,25,"“But you say, ‘The Lord’s way isn’t fair.’ Now listen, house of Israel: Is it My way that is unfair? Instead, isn’t it your ways that are unfair?"
Ezekiel,18,26,"When a righteous person turns from his righteousness and practices iniquity, he will die for this. He will die because of the iniquity he has practiced."
Ezekiel,18,27,"But if a wicked person turns from the wickedness he has committed and does what is just and right, he will preserve his life."
Ezekiel,18,28,He will certainly live because he thought it over and turned from all the transgressions he had committed; he will not die.
Ezekiel,18,29,"But the house of Israel says, ‘The Lord’s way isn’t fair.’ Is it My ways that are unfair, house of Israel? Instead, isn’t it your ways that are unfair?"
Ezekiel,18,30,"“Therefore, house of Israel, I will judge each one of you according to his ways.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD. “Repent and turn from all your transgressions, so they will not be a stumbling block that causes your punishment."
Ezekiel,18,31,"Throw off all the transgressions you have committed, and get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. Why should you die, house of Israel?"
Ezekiel,18,32,For I take no pleasure in anyone’s death.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD. “So repent and live!
Ezekiel,19,1,"“Now, lament for the princes of Israel"
Ezekiel,19,2,and say: What was your mother? A lioness! She lay down among the lions; she reared her cubs among the young lions.
Ezekiel,19,3,"She brought up one of her cubs, and he became a young lion. After he learned to tear prey, he devoured people."
Ezekiel,19,4,"When the nations heard about him, he was caught in their pit. Then they led him away with hooks to the land of Egypt."
Ezekiel,19,5,"When she saw that she waited in vain, that her hope was lost, she took another of her cubs and made him a young lion."
Ezekiel,19,6,"He prowled among the lions, and he became a young lion. After he learned to tear prey, he devoured people."
Ezekiel,19,7,He devastated their strongholds and destroyed their cities. The land and everything in it shuddered at the sound of his roaring.
Ezekiel,19,8,Then the nations from the surrounding provinces set out against him. They spread their net over him; he was caught in their pit.
Ezekiel,19,9,They put a wooden yoke on him with hooks and led him away to the king of Babylon. They brought him into the fortresses so his roar could no longer be heard on the mountains of Israel.
Ezekiel,19,10,"Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard, planted by the water; it was fruitful and full of branches because of plentiful waters."
Ezekiel,19,11,"It had strong branches, fit for the scepters of rulers; its height towered among the clouds. So it was conspicuous for its height as well as its many branches."
Ezekiel,19,12,"But it was uprooted in fury, thrown to the ground, and the east wind dried up its fruit. Its strong branches were torn off and dried up; fire consumed them."
Ezekiel,19,13,"Now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land."
Ezekiel,19,14,"Fire has gone out from its main branch and has devoured its fruit, so that it no longer has a strong branch, a scepter for ruling. This is a lament and should be used as a lament.”"
Ezekiel,20,1,"In the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, some of Israel’s elders came to consult the LORD, and they sat down in front of me."
Ezekiel,20,2,Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,20,3,"“Son of man, speak with the elders of Israel and tell them: This is what the Lord GOD says: Are you coming to consult Me? As I live, I will not be consulted by you.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,20,4,"“Will you pass judgment against them, will you pass judgment, son of man? Explain the detestable practices of their fathers to them."
Ezekiel,20,5,"Say to them: This is what the Lord GOD says: On the day I chose Israel, I swore an oath to the descendants of Jacob’s house and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt. I swore to them, saying: I am Yahweh your God."
Ezekiel,20,6,"On that day I swore to them that I would bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most beautiful of all lands."
Ezekiel,20,7,I also said to them: Each of you must throw away the detestable things that are before your eyes and not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.
Ezekiel,20,8,"“But they rebelled against Me and were unwilling to listen to Me. None of them threw away the detestable things that were before their eyes, and they did not forsake the idols of Egypt. So I considered pouring out My wrath on them, exhausting My anger against them within the land of Egypt."
Ezekiel,20,9,"But I acted because of My name, so that it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations they were living among, in whose sight I had made Myself known to Israel by bringing them out of Egypt."
Ezekiel,20,10,“So I brought them out of the land of Egypt and led them into the wilderness.
Ezekiel,20,11,Then I gave them My statutes and explained My ordinances to them—the person who does them will live by them.
Ezekiel,20,12,"I also gave them My Sabbaths to serve as a sign between Me and them, so they will know that I am Yahweh who sets them apart as holy."
Ezekiel,20,13,“But the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness. They did not follow My statutes and they rejected My ordinances—the person who does them will live by them. They also completely profaned My Sabbaths. So I considered pouring out My wrath on them in the wilderness to put an end to them.
Ezekiel,20,14,"But I acted because of My name, so that it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out."
Ezekiel,20,15,"However, I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land I had given them—the most beautiful of all lands, flowing with milk and honey—"
Ezekiel,20,16,"because they rejected My ordinances, profaned My Sabbaths, and did not follow My statutes. For their hearts went after their idols."
Ezekiel,20,17,But I spared them from destruction and did not bring them to an end in the wilderness.
Ezekiel,20,18,"“Then I said to their children in the wilderness: Don’t follow the statutes of your fathers, defile yourselves with their idols, or keep their ordinances."
Ezekiel,20,19,"I am Yahweh your God. Follow My statutes, keep My ordinances, and practice them."
Ezekiel,20,20,"Keep My Sabbaths holy, and they will be a sign between Me and you, so you may know that I am Yahweh your God."
Ezekiel,20,21,“But the children rebelled against Me. They did not follow My statutes or carefully keep My ordinances—the person who does them will live by them. They also profaned My Sabbaths. So I considered pouring out My wrath on them and exhausting My anger against them in the wilderness.
Ezekiel,20,22,"But I withheld My hand and acted because of My name, so that it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I brought them out."
Ezekiel,20,23,"However, I swore to them in the wilderness that I would disperse them among the nations and scatter them among the countries."
Ezekiel,20,24,"For they did not practice My ordinances but rejected My statutes and profaned My Sabbaths, and their eyes were fixed on their fathers’ idols."
Ezekiel,20,25,I also gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances they could not live by.
Ezekiel,20,26,"When they made every firstborn pass through the fire, I defiled them through their gifts in order to devastate them so they would know that I am Yahweh."
Ezekiel,20,27,"“Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and tell them: This is what the Lord GOD says: In this way also your fathers blasphemed Me by committing treachery against Me:"
Ezekiel,20,28,"When I brought them into the land that I swore to give them and they saw any high hill or leafy tree, they offered their sacrifices and presented their offensive offerings there. They also sent up their pleasing aromas and poured out their drink offerings there."
Ezekiel,20,29,So I asked them: What is this high place you are going to? And it is called High Place to this day.
Ezekiel,20,30,"“Therefore say to the house of Israel: This is what the Lord GOD says: Are you defiling yourselves the way your fathers did, and prostituting yourselves with their detestable things?"
Ezekiel,20,31,"When you offer your gifts, making your children pass through the fire, you continue to defile yourselves with all your idols to this day. So should I be consulted by you, house of Israel? As I live”—this is the declaration of the Lord GOD—“I will not be consulted by you!"
Ezekiel,20,32,"“When you say, ‘Let us be like the nations, like the peoples of other countries, worshiping wood and stone,’ what you have in mind will never happen."
Ezekiel,20,33,"As I live”—the declaration of the Lord GOD—“I will rule over you with a strong hand, an outstretched arm, and outpoured wrath."
Ezekiel,20,34,"I will bring you from the peoples and gather you from the countries where you were scattered, with a strong hand, an outstretched arm, and outpoured wrath."
Ezekiel,20,35,I will lead you into the wilderness of the peoples and enter into judgment with you there face to face.
Ezekiel,20,36,"Just as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,20,37,“I will make you pass under the rod and will bring you into the bond of the covenant.
Ezekiel,20,38,"And I will also purge you of those who rebel and transgress against Me. I will bring them out of the land where they live as foreign residents, but they will not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am Yahweh."
Ezekiel,20,39,"“As for you, house of Israel, this is what the Lord GOD says: Go and serve your idols, each of you. But afterward you will surely listen to Me, and you will no longer defile My holy name with your gifts and idols."
Ezekiel,20,40,"For on My holy mountain, Israel’s high mountain”—the declaration of the Lord GOD—“there the entire house of Israel, all of them, will serve Me in the land. There I will accept them and will require your contributions and choicest gifts, all your holy offerings."
Ezekiel,20,41,"When I bring you from the peoples and gather you from the countries where you have been scattered, I will accept you as a pleasing aroma. And I will demonstrate My holiness through you in the sight of the nations."
Ezekiel,20,42,"When I lead you into the land of Israel, the land I swore to give your fathers, you will know that I am Yahweh."
Ezekiel,20,43,"There you will remember your ways and all your deeds that you have defiled yourselves with, and you will loathe yourselves for all the evil things you have done."
Ezekiel,20,44,"You will know that I am Yahweh, house of Israel, when I have dealt with you because of My name rather than according to your evil ways and corrupt acts.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,20,45,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,20,46,"“Son of man, face the south and preach against it. Prophesy against the forest land in the Negev,"
Ezekiel,20,47,"and say to the forest there: Hear the word of the LORD! This is what the Lord GOD says: I am about to ignite a fire in you, and it will devour every green tree and every dry tree in you. The blazing flame will not be extinguished, and every face from the south to the north will be scorched by it."
Ezekiel,20,48,"Then all people will see that I, Yahweh, have kindled it. It will not be extinguished.”"
Ezekiel,20,49,"Then I said, “Oh, Lord GOD, they are saying of me, ‘Isn’t he just posing riddles?’”"
Ezekiel,21,1,The word of the LORD came to me again:
Ezekiel,21,2,"“Son of man, turn your face toward Jerusalem and preach against the sanctuaries. Prophesy against the land of Israel,"
Ezekiel,21,3,and say to it: This is what the LORD says: I am against you. I will draw My sword from its sheath and cut off both the righteous and the wicked from you.
Ezekiel,21,4,"Since I will cut off both the righteous and the wicked, My sword will therefore come out of its sheath against everyone from the south to the north."
Ezekiel,21,5,"So all the people will know that I, Yahweh, have taken My sword from its sheath—it will not be sheathed again."
Ezekiel,21,6,"“But you, son of man, groan! Groan bitterly with a broken heart right before their eyes."
Ezekiel,21,7,"And when they ask you, ‘Why are you groaning?’ then say: Because of the news that is coming. Every heart will melt, and every hand will become weak. Every spirit will be discouraged, and every knee will turn to water. Yes, it is coming and it will happen.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,21,8,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,21,9,"“Son of man, prophesy: This is what the Lord says! You are to proclaim: A sword! A sword is sharpened and also polished."
Ezekiel,21,10,"It is sharpened for slaughter, polished to flash like lightning! Should we rejoice? The scepter of My son, the sword despises every tree."
Ezekiel,21,11,"The sword is given to be polished, to be grasped in the hand. It is sharpened, and it is polished, to be put in the hand of the slayer."
Ezekiel,21,12,"Cry out and wail, son of man, for it is against My people. It is against all the princes of Israel! They are given over to the sword with My people. Therefore strike your thigh in grief."
Ezekiel,21,13,Surely it will be a trial! And what if the sword despises even the scepter? The scepter will not continue. This is the declaration of the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel,21,14,"Therefore, son of man, prophesy and clap your hands together. Let the sword strike two times, even three. It is a sword for massacre, a sword for great massacre— it surrounds them!"
Ezekiel,21,15,"I have appointed a sword for slaughter at all their gates, so that their hearts may melt and many may stumble. Yes! It is ready to flash like lightning; it is drawn for slaughter."
Ezekiel,21,16,Slash to the right; turn to the left— wherever your blade is directed.
Ezekiel,21,17,"I also will clap My hands together, and I will satisfy My wrath. I, Yahweh, have spoken.”"
Ezekiel,21,18,Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,21,19,"“Now you, son of man, mark out two roads that the sword of Babylon’s king can take. Both of them should originate from the same land. And make a signpost at the fork in the road to each city."
Ezekiel,21,20,Mark out a road that the sword can take to Rabbah of the Ammonites and to Judah into fortified Jerusalem.
Ezekiel,21,21,"For the king of Babylon stands at the split in the road, at the fork of the two roads, to practice divination: he shakes the arrows, consults the idols, and observes the liver."
Ezekiel,21,22,"The answer marked Jerusalem appears in his right hand, indicating that he should set up battering rams, give the order to slaughter, raise a battle cry, set battering rams against the gates, build a ramp, and construct a siege wall."
Ezekiel,21,23,"It will seem like false divination in the eyes of those who have sworn an oath to the Babylonians, but it will draw attention to their guilt so that they will be captured."
Ezekiel,21,24,"“Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says: Because you have drawn attention to your guilt, exposing your transgressions, so that your sins are revealed in all your actions, since you have done this, you will be captured by them."
Ezekiel,21,25,"And you, profane and wicked prince of Israel, the day has come for your punishment.”"
Ezekiel,21,26,"This is what the Lord GOD says: Remove the turban, and take off the crown. Things will not remain as they are; exalt the lowly and bring down the exalted."
Ezekiel,21,27,"A ruin, a ruin, I will make it a ruin! Yet this will not happen until He comes; I have given the judgment to Him."
Ezekiel,21,28,"“Now prophesy, son of man, and say: This is what the Lord GOD says concerning the Ammonites and their contempt. You are to proclaim: A sword! A sword is drawn for slaughter, polished to consume, to flash like lightning."
Ezekiel,21,29,"While they offer false visions and lying divinations about you, the time has come to put you to the necks of the profane wicked ones; the day has come for your punishment."
Ezekiel,21,30,"Return it to its sheath! I will judge you in the place where you were created, in the land of your origin."
Ezekiel,21,31,"I will pour out My indignation on you; I will blow the fire of My fury on you. I will hand you over to brutal men, skilled at destruction."
Ezekiel,21,32,"You will be fuel for the fire. Your blood will be spilled in the land. You will not be remembered, for I, Yahweh, have spoken.”"
Ezekiel,22,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,22,2,"“As for you, son of man, will you pass judgment? Will you pass judgment against the city of blood? Then explain all her detestable practices to her."
Ezekiel,22,3,You are to say: This is what the Lord GOD says: A city that sheds blood within her walls so that her time of judgment has come and who makes idols for herself so that she is defiled!
Ezekiel,22,4,"You are guilty of the blood you have shed, and you are defiled from the idols you have made. You have brought your judgment days near and have come to your years of punishment. Therefore, I have made you a disgrace to the nations and a mockery to all the lands."
Ezekiel,22,5,"Those who are near and those far away from you will mock you, you infamous one full of turmoil."
Ezekiel,22,6,"“Look, every prince of Israel within you has used his strength to shed blood."
Ezekiel,22,7,"Father and mother are treated with contempt, and the foreign resident is exploited within you. The fatherless and widow are oppressed in you."
Ezekiel,22,8,You despise My holy things and profane My Sabbaths.
Ezekiel,22,9,There are men within you who slander in order to shed blood. People who live in you eat at the mountain shrines; they commit immoral acts within you.
Ezekiel,22,10,Men within you have sexual intercourse with their father’s wife and violate women during their menstrual impurity.
Ezekiel,22,11,"One man within you commits a detestable act with his neighbor’s wife; another wickedly defiles his daughter-in-law; and yet another violates his sister, his father’s daughter."
Ezekiel,22,12,People who live in you accept bribes in order to shed blood. You take interest and profit on a loan and brutally extort your neighbors. You have forgotten Me.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel,22,13,"“Now look, I clap My hands together against the dishonest profit you have made and against the blood shed among you."
Ezekiel,22,14,"Will your courage endure or your hands be strong in the days when I deal with you? I, Yahweh, have spoken, and I will act."
Ezekiel,22,15,I will disperse you among the nations and scatter you among the countries; I will purge your uncleanness.
Ezekiel,22,16,You will be profaned in the sight of the nations. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.”
Ezekiel,22,17,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,22,18,"“Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to Me. All of them are copper, tin, iron, and lead inside the furnace; they are the dross of silver."
Ezekiel,22,19,"Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says: Because all of you have become dross, I am about to gather you into Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,22,20,"Just as one gathers silver, copper, iron, lead, and tin into the furnace to blow fire on them and melt them, so I will gather you in My anger and wrath, put you inside, and melt you."
Ezekiel,22,21,"Yes, I will gather you together and blow on you with the fire of My fury, and you will be melted within the city."
Ezekiel,22,22,"As silver is melted inside a furnace, so you will be melted inside the city. Then you will know that I, Yahweh, have poured out My wrath on you.”"
Ezekiel,22,23,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,22,24,"“Son of man, say to her: You are a land that has not been cleansed, that has not received rain in the day of indignation."
Ezekiel,22,25,"The conspiracy of her prophets within her is like a roaring lion tearing its prey: they devour people, seize wealth and valuables, and multiply the widows within her."
Ezekiel,22,26,"Her priests do violence to My instruction and profane My holy things. They make no distinction between the holy and the common, and they do not explain the difference between the clean and the unclean. They disregard My Sabbaths, and I am profaned among them."
Ezekiel,22,27,"“Her officials within her are like wolves tearing their prey, shedding blood, and destroying lives in order to make profit dishonestly."
Ezekiel,22,28,"Her prophets plaster with whitewash for them by seeing false visions and lying divinations, and they say, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says,’ when the LORD has not spoken."
Ezekiel,22,29,The people of the land have practiced extortion and committed robbery. They have oppressed the poor and needy and unlawfully exploited the foreign resident.
Ezekiel,22,30,"I searched for a man among them who would repair the wall and stand in the gap before Me on behalf of the land so that I might not destroy it, but I found no one."
Ezekiel,22,31,So I have poured out My indignation on them and consumed them with the fire of My fury. I have brought their actions down on their own heads.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel,23,1,The word of the LORD came to me again:
Ezekiel,23,2,"“Son of man, there were two women, daughters of the same mother,"
Ezekiel,23,3,"who acted like prostitutes in Egypt, behaving promiscuously in their youth. Their breasts were fondled there, and their virgin nipples caressed."
Ezekiel,23,4,"The older one was named Oholah, and her sister was Oholibah. They became Mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. As for their names, Oholah represents Samaria and Oholibah represents Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,23,5,"“Oholah acted like a prostitute even though she was Mine. She lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians: warriors"
Ezekiel,23,6,"dressed in blue, governors and prefects, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on steeds."
Ezekiel,23,7,She offered her sexual favors to them; all of them were the elite of Assyria. She defiled herself with all those she lusted after and with all their idols.
Ezekiel,23,8,"She didn’t give up her promiscuity that began in Egypt, when men slept with her in her youth, caressed her virgin nipples, and poured out their lust on her."
Ezekiel,23,9,"Therefore, I handed her over to her lovers, the Assyrians she lusted for."
Ezekiel,23,10,"They exposed her nakedness, seized her sons and daughters, and killed her with the sword. Since they executed judgment against her, she became notorious among women."
Ezekiel,23,11,"“Now her sister Oholibah saw this, but she was even more depraved in her lust than Oholah, and made her promiscuous acts worse than those of her sister."
Ezekiel,23,12,"She lusted after the Assyrians: governors and prefects, warriors splendidly dressed, horsemen riding on steeds, all of them desirable young men."
Ezekiel,23,13,And I saw that she had defiled herself; both of them had taken the same path.
Ezekiel,23,14,"But she increased her promiscuity when she saw male figures carved on the wall, images of the Chaldeans, engraved in vermilion,"
Ezekiel,23,15,"wearing belts on their waists and flowing turbans on their heads; all of them looked like officers, a depiction of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their birth."
Ezekiel,23,16,At the sight of them she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.
Ezekiel,23,17,"Then the Babylonians came to her, to the bed of love, and defiled her with their lust. But after she was defiled by them, she turned away from them in disgust."
Ezekiel,23,18,"When she flaunted her promiscuity and exposed her nakedness, I turned away from her in disgust just as I turned away from her sister."
Ezekiel,23,19,"Yet she multiplied her acts of promiscuity, remembering the days of her youth when she acted like a prostitute in the land of Egypt"
Ezekiel,23,20,"and lusted after their lovers, whose sexual members were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of stallions."
Ezekiel,23,21,"So you revisited the indecency of your youth, when the Egyptians caressed your nipples to enjoy your youthful breasts."
Ezekiel,23,22,"“Therefore Oholibah, this is what the Lord GOD says: I am going to incite your lovers against you, those you turned away from in disgust. I will bring them against you from every side:"
Ezekiel,23,23,"the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans; Pekod, Shoa, and Koa; and all the Assyrians with them—desirable young men, all of them governors and prefects, officers and administrators, all of them riding on horses."
Ezekiel,23,24,"They will come against you with an alliance of nations and with weapons, chariots, and wagons. They will set themselves against you on every side with shields, bucklers, and helmets. I will delegate judgment to them, and they will judge you by their own standards."
Ezekiel,23,25,"When I vent My jealous rage on you, they will deal with you in wrath. They will cut off your nose and ears, and your descendants will fall by the sword. They will seize your sons and daughters, and your descendants will be consumed by fire."
Ezekiel,23,26,They will strip off your clothes and take your beautiful jewelry.
Ezekiel,23,27,"So I will put an end to your indecency and sexual immorality, which began in the land of Egypt, and you will not look longingly at them or remember Egypt anymore."
Ezekiel,23,28,"“For this is what the Lord GOD says: I am going to hand you over to those you hate, to those you turned away from in disgust."
Ezekiel,23,29,"They will treat you with hatred, take all you have worked for, and leave you stark naked, so that the shame of your debauchery will be exposed, both your indecency and promiscuity."
Ezekiel,23,30,"These things will be done to you because you acted like a prostitute with the nations, defiling yourself with their idols."
Ezekiel,23,31,"You have followed the path of your sister, so I will put her cup in your hand.”"
Ezekiel,23,32,"This is what the Lord GOD says: You will drink your sister’s cup, which is deep and wide. You will be an object of ridicule and scorn, for it holds so much."
Ezekiel,23,33,"You will be filled with drunkenness and grief, with a cup of devastation and desolation, the cup of your sister Samaria."
Ezekiel,23,34,"You will drink it and drain it; then you will gnaw its broken pieces, and tear your breasts. For I have spoken. This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,23,35,"Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says: “Because you have forgotten Me and cast Me behind your back, you must bear the consequences of your indecency and promiscuity.”"
Ezekiel,23,36,"Then the LORD said to me: “Son of man, will you pass judgment against Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare their detestable practices to them."
Ezekiel,23,37,"For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands; they have committed adultery with their idols. They have even made the children they bore to Me pass through the fire as food for the idols."
Ezekiel,23,38,They also did this to Me: they defiled My sanctuary on that same day and profaned My Sabbaths.
Ezekiel,23,39,"On the same day they slaughtered their children for their idols, they entered My sanctuary to profane it. Yes, that is what they did inside My house."
Ezekiel,23,40,"“In addition, they sent for men who came from far away when a messenger was dispatched to them. And look how they came! You bathed, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with jewelry for them."
Ezekiel,23,41,"You sat on a luxurious couch with a table spread before it, on which you had set My incense and oil."
Ezekiel,23,42,"The sound of a carefree crowd was there. Drunkards from the desert were brought in, along with common men. They put bracelets on the women’s hands and beautiful crowns on their heads."
Ezekiel,23,43,"Then I said concerning this woman worn out by adultery: Will they now have illicit sex with her, even her?"
Ezekiel,23,44,"Yet they had sex with her as one does with a prostitute. This is how they had sex with Oholah and Oholibah, those obscene women."
Ezekiel,23,45,"But righteous men will judge them the way adulteresses and those who shed blood are judged, for they are adulteresses and blood is on their hands."
Ezekiel,23,46,“This is what the Lord GOD says: Summon an assembly against them and consign them to terror and plunder.
Ezekiel,23,47,The assembly will stone them and cut them down with their swords. They will kill their sons and daughters and burn their houses with fire.
Ezekiel,23,48,"So I will put an end to indecency in the land, and all the women will be admonished not to imitate your indecent behavior."
Ezekiel,23,49,"They will repay you for your indecency, and you will bear the consequences for your sins of idolatry. Then you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh.”"
Ezekiel,24,1,"The word of the LORD came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month:"
Ezekiel,24,2,"“Son of man, write down today’s date, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day."
Ezekiel,24,3,"Now speak a parable to the rebellious house. Tell them: This is what the Lord GOD says: Put the pot on the fire— put it on, and then pour water into it!"
Ezekiel,24,4,"Place the pieces of meat in it, every good piece— thigh and shoulder. Fill it with choice bones."
Ezekiel,24,5,Take the choicest of the flock and also pile up the fuel under it. Bring it to a boil and cook the bones in it.”
Ezekiel,24,6,"Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says: Woe to the city of bloodshed, the pot that has rust inside it, and whose rust will not come off! Empty it piece by piece; lots should not be cast for its contents."
Ezekiel,24,7,For the blood she shed is still within her. She put it out on the bare rock; she didn’t pour it on the ground to cover it with dust.
Ezekiel,24,8,"In order to stir up wrath and take vengeance, I have put her blood on the bare rock, so that it would not be covered."
Ezekiel,24,9,"Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says: Woe to the city of bloodshed! I Myself will make the pile of kindling large."
Ezekiel,24,10,Pile on the logs and kindle the fire! Cook the meat well and mix in the spices! Let the bones be burned!
Ezekiel,24,11,Set the empty pot on its coals so that it becomes hot and its copper glows. Then its impurity will melt inside it; its rust will be consumed.
Ezekiel,24,12,It has frustrated every effort; its thick rust will not come off. Into the fire with its rust!
Ezekiel,24,13,"Because of the indecency of your uncleanness— since I tried to purify you, but you would not be purified from your uncleanness— you will not be pure again until I have satisfied My wrath on you."
Ezekiel,24,14,"I, Yahweh, have spoken. It is coming, and I will do it! I will not refrain, I will not show pity, and I will not relent. I will judge you according to your ways and deeds. This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,24,15,Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,24,16,"“Son of man, I am about to take the delight of your eyes away from you with a fatal blow. But you must not lament or weep or let your tears flow."
Ezekiel,24,17,Groan quietly; do not observe mourning rites for the dead. Put on your turban and strap your sandals on your feet; do not cover your mustache or eat the bread of mourners.”
Ezekiel,24,18,"I spoke to the people in the morning, and my wife died in the evening. The next morning I did just as I was commanded."
Ezekiel,24,19,"Then the people asked me, “Won’t you tell us what these things you are doing mean for us?”"
Ezekiel,24,20,So I answered them: “The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,24,21,"‘Say to the house of Israel: This is what the Lord GOD says: I am about to desecrate My sanctuary, the pride of your power, the delight of your eyes, and the desire of your heart. Also, the sons and daughters you left behind will fall by the sword."
Ezekiel,24,22,Then you will do just as I have done: You will not cover your mustache or eat the bread of mourners.
Ezekiel,24,23,Your turbans will remain on your heads and your sandals on your feet. You will not lament or weep but will waste away because of your sins and will groan to one another.
Ezekiel,24,24,"Now Ezekiel will be a sign for you. You will do everything that he has done. When this happens, you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh."
Ezekiel,24,25,"“‘Son of man, know that on the day I take their stronghold from them, their pride and joy, the delight of their eyes and the longing of their hearts, as well as their sons and daughters,"
Ezekiel,24,26,on that day a fugitive will come to you and report the news.
Ezekiel,24,27,"On that day your mouth will be opened to talk with him; you will speak and no longer be mute. So you will be a sign for them, and they will know that I am Yahweh.’”"
Ezekiel,25,1,Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,25,2,"“Son of man, turn your face toward the Ammonites and prophesy against them."
Ezekiel,25,3,"Say to the Ammonites: Hear the word of the Lord GOD: This is what the Lord GOD says: Because you said, ‘Good!’ about My sanctuary when it was desecrated, about the land of Israel when it was laid waste, and about the house of Judah when they went into exile,"
Ezekiel,25,4,therefore I am about to give you to the people of the east as a possession. They will set up their encampments and pitch their tents among you. They will eat your fruit and drink your milk.
Ezekiel,25,5,I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and Ammon a sheepfold. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.”
Ezekiel,25,6,"For this is what the Lord GOD says: “Because you clapped your hands, stamped your feet, and rejoiced over the land of Israel with wholehearted contempt,"
Ezekiel,25,7,"therefore I am about to stretch out My hand against you and give you as plunder to the nations. I will cut you off from the peoples and eliminate you from the countries. I will destroy you, and you will know that I am Yahweh.”"
Ezekiel,25,8,"This is what the Lord GOD says: “Because Moab and Seir said, ‘Look, the house of Judah is like all the other nations,’"
Ezekiel,25,9,"therefore I am about to expose Moab’s flank beginning with its frontier cities, the pride of the land: Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim."
Ezekiel,25,10,"I will give it along with Ammon to the people of the east as a possession, so that Ammon will not be remembered among the nations."
Ezekiel,25,11,"So I will execute judgments against Moab, and they will know that I am Yahweh.”"
Ezekiel,25,12,"This is what the Lord GOD says: “Because Edom acted vengefully against the house of Judah and incurred grievous guilt by taking revenge on them,"
Ezekiel,25,13,therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: I will stretch out My hand against Edom and cut off both man and animal from it. I will make it a wasteland; they will fall by the sword from Teman to Dedan.
Ezekiel,25,14,"I will take My vengeance on Edom through My people Israel, and they will deal with Edom according to My anger and wrath. So they will know My vengeance.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,25,15,"This is what the Lord GOD says: “Because the Philistines acted in vengeance and took revenge with deep contempt, destroying because of their ancient hatred,"
Ezekiel,25,16,"therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: I am about to stretch out My hand against the Philistines, cutting off the Cherethites and wiping out what remains of the coastal peoples."
Ezekiel,25,17,I will execute great vengeance against them with furious rebukes. They will know that I am Yahweh when I take My vengeance on them.”
Ezekiel,26,1,"In the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:"
Ezekiel,26,2,"“Son of man, because Tyre said about Jerusalem, ‘Good! The gateway to the peoples is shattered. She has been turned over to me. I will be filled now that she lies in ruins,’"
Ezekiel,26,3,"therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: See, I am against you, Tyre! I will raise up many nations against you, just as the sea raises its waves."
Ezekiel,26,4,They will destroy the walls of Tyre and demolish her towers. I will scrape the soil from her and turn her into a bare rock.
Ezekiel,26,5,"She will become a place in the sea to spread nets, for I have spoken.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD. “She will become plunder for the nations,"
Ezekiel,26,6,and her villages on the mainland will be slaughtered by the sword. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.”
Ezekiel,26,7,"For this is what the Lord GOD says: “See, I am about to bring King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, king of kings, against Tyre from the north with horses, chariots, cavalry, and a vast company of troops."
Ezekiel,26,8,"He will slaughter your villages on the mainland with the sword. He will set up siege works against you, and will build a ramp and raise a wall of shields against you."
Ezekiel,26,9,He will direct the blows of his battering rams against your walls and tear down your towers with his iron tools.
Ezekiel,26,10,"His horses will be so numerous that their dust will cover you. When he enters your gates as an army entering a breached city, your walls will shake from the noise of cavalry, wagons, and chariots."
Ezekiel,26,11,"He will trample all your streets with the hooves of his horses. He will slaughter your people with the sword, and your mighty pillars will fall to the ground."
Ezekiel,26,12,"They will take your wealth as spoil and plunder your merchandise. They will also demolish your walls and tear down your beautiful homes. Then they will throw your stones, timber, and soil into the water."
Ezekiel,26,13,"I will put an end to the noise of your songs, and the sound of your lyres will no longer be heard."
Ezekiel,26,14,"I will turn you into a bare rock, and you will be a place to spread nets. You will never be rebuilt, for I, Yahweh, have spoken.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,26,15,"This is what the Lord GOD says to Tyre: “Won’t the coasts and islands quake at the sound of your downfall, when the wounded groan and slaughter occurs within you?"
Ezekiel,26,16,"All the princes of the sea will descend from their thrones, remove their robes, and strip off their embroidered garments. They will clothe themselves with trembling; they will sit on the ground, tremble continually, and be appalled at you."
Ezekiel,26,17,"Then they will lament for you and say of you: How you have perished, city of renown, you who were populated from the seas! She who was powerful on the sea, she and all of her inhabitants inflicted their terror."
Ezekiel,26,18,Now the coastlands tremble on the day of your downfall; the islands in the sea are alarmed by your demise.”
Ezekiel,26,19,"For this is what the Lord GOD says: “When I make you a ruined city like other deserted cities, when I raise up the deep against you so that the mighty waters cover you,"
Ezekiel,26,20,"then I will bring you down to be with those who descend to the Pit, to the people of antiquity. I will make you dwell in the underworld like the ancient ruins, with those who descend to the Pit, so that you will no longer be inhabited or display your splendor in the land of the living."
Ezekiel,26,21,"I will make you an object of horror, and you will no longer exist. You will be sought but will never be found again.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,27,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,27,2,"“Now, son of man, lament for Tyre."
Ezekiel,27,3,"Say to Tyre, who is located at the entrance of the sea, merchant of the peoples to many coasts and islands: This is what the Lord GOD says: Tyre, you declared, ‘I am perfect in beauty.’"
Ezekiel,27,4,Your realm was in the heart of the sea; your builders perfected your beauty.
Ezekiel,27,5,They constructed all your planking with pine trees from Senir. They took a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you.
Ezekiel,27,6,"They made your oars of oaks from Bashan. They made your deck of cypress wood from the coasts of Cyprus, inlaid with ivory."
Ezekiel,27,7,"Your sail was made of fine embroidered linen from Egypt, and served as your banner. Your awning was of blue and purple fabric from the coasts of Elishah."
Ezekiel,27,8,"The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers. Your wise men were within you, Tyre; they were your captains."
Ezekiel,27,9,"The elders of Gebal and its wise men were within you, repairing your leaks. All the ships of the sea and their sailors came to you to barter for your goods."
Ezekiel,27,10,"Men of Persia, Lud, and Put were in your army, serving as your warriors. They hung shields and helmets in you; they gave you splendor."
Ezekiel,27,11,"Men of Arvad and Helech were stationed on your walls all around, and Gammadites were in your towers. They hung their shields all around your walls; they perfected your beauty."
Ezekiel,27,12,"“Tarshish was your trading partner because of your great wealth of every kind. They exchanged silver, iron, tin, and lead for your merchandise."
Ezekiel,27,13,"Javan, Tubal, and Meshech were your merchants. They exchanged slaves and bronze utensils for your goods."
Ezekiel,27,14,"Those from Beth-togarmah exchanged horses, war horses, and mules for your merchandise."
Ezekiel,27,15,Men of Dedan were also your merchants; many coasts and islands were your regular markets. They brought back ivory tusks and ebony as your payment.
Ezekiel,27,16,"Aram was your trading partner because of your numerous products. They exchanged turquoise, purple and embroidered cloth, fine linen, coral, and rubies for your merchandise."
Ezekiel,27,17,"Judah and the land of Israel were your merchants. They exchanged wheat from Minnith, meal, honey, oil, and balm, for your goods."
Ezekiel,27,18,"Damascus was also your trading partner because of your numerous products and your great wealth of every kind, trading in wine from Helbon and white wool."
Ezekiel,27,19,"Vedan and Javan from Uzal dealt in your merchandise; wrought iron, cassia, and aromatic cane were exchanged for your goods."
Ezekiel,27,20,Dedan was your merchant in saddlecloths for riding.
Ezekiel,27,21,"Arabia and all the princes of Kedar were your business partners, trading with you in lambs, rams, and goats."
Ezekiel,27,22,"The merchants of Sheba and Raamah traded with you. They exchanged gold, the best of all spices, and all kinds of precious stones for your merchandise."
Ezekiel,27,23,"Haran, Canneh, Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad traded with you."
Ezekiel,27,24,"They were your merchants in choice garments, cloaks of blue and embroidered materials, and multicolored carpets, which were bound and secured with cords in your marketplace."
Ezekiel,27,25,Ships of Tarshish were the carriers for your goods. So you became full and heavily loaded in the heart of the sea.
Ezekiel,27,26,"Your rowers have brought you onto the high seas, but the east wind has shattered you in the heart of the sea."
Ezekiel,27,27,"Your wealth, merchandise, and goods, your sailors and captains, those who repair your leaks, those who barter for your goods, and all the warriors within you, with all the other people on board, sink into the heart of the sea on the day of your downfall."
Ezekiel,27,28,The countryside shakes at the sound of your sailors’ cries.
Ezekiel,27,29,All those who handle an oar disembark from their ships. The sailors and all the captains of the sea stand on the shore.
Ezekiel,27,30,They raise their voices over you and cry out bitterly. They throw dust on their heads; they roll in ashes.
Ezekiel,27,31,They shave their heads because of you and wrap themselves in sackcloth. They weep over you with deep anguish and bitter mourning.
Ezekiel,27,32,"In their wailing they lament for you, mourning over you: Who was like Tyre, silenced in the middle of the sea?"
Ezekiel,27,33,"When your merchandise was unloaded from the seas, you satisfied many peoples. You enriched the kings of the earth with your abundant wealth and goods."
Ezekiel,27,34,Now you are shattered by the sea in the depths of the waters; your goods and the people within you have gone down.
Ezekiel,27,35,All the inhabitants of the coasts and islands are appalled at you. Their kings shudder with fear; their faces are contorted.
Ezekiel,27,36,Those who trade among the peoples mock you; you have become an object of horror and will never exist again.”
Ezekiel,28,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,28,2,"“Son of man, say to the ruler of Tyre: This is what the Lord GOD says: Your heart is proud, and you have said, ‘I am a god; I sit in the seat of gods in the heart of the sea.’ Yet you are a man and not a god, though you have regarded your heart as that of a god."
Ezekiel,28,3,"Yes, you are wiser than Daniel; no secret is hidden from you!"
Ezekiel,28,4,By your wisdom and understanding you have acquired wealth for yourself. You have acquired gold and silver for your treasuries.
Ezekiel,28,5,"By your great skill in trading you have increased your wealth, but your heart has become proud because of your wealth.”"
Ezekiel,28,6,"Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: Because you regard your heart as that of a god,"
Ezekiel,28,7,"I am about to bring strangers against you, ruthless men from the nations. They will draw their swords against your magnificent wisdom and will defile your splendor."
Ezekiel,28,8,"They will bring you down to the Pit, and you will die a violent death in the heart of the sea."
Ezekiel,28,9,"Will you still say, ‘I am a god,’ in the presence of those who kill you? Yet you will be only a man, not a god, in the hands of those who kill you."
Ezekiel,28,10,You will die the death of the uncircumcised at the hands of strangers. For I have spoken. This is the declaration of the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel,28,11,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,28,12,"“Son of man, lament for the king of Tyre and say to him: This is what the Lord GOD says: You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty."
Ezekiel,28,13,"You were in Eden, the garden of God. Every kind of precious stone covered you: carnelian, topaz, and diamond, beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, turquoise and emerald. Your mountings and settings were crafted in gold; they were prepared on the day you were created."
Ezekiel,28,14,"You were an anointed guardian cherub, for I had appointed you. You were on the holy mountain of God; you walked among the fiery stones."
Ezekiel,28,15,From the day you were created you were blameless in your ways until wickedness was found in you.
Ezekiel,28,16,"Through the abundance of your trade, you were filled with violence, and you sinned. So I expelled you in disgrace from the mountain of God, and banished you, guardian cherub, from among the fiery stones."
Ezekiel,28,17,Your heart became proud because of your beauty; For the sake of your splendor you corrupted your wisdom. So I threw you down to the earth; I made you a spectacle before kings.
Ezekiel,28,18,"You profaned your sanctuaries by the magnitude of your iniquities in your dishonest trade. So I made fire come from within you, and it consumed you. I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the sight of everyone watching you."
Ezekiel,28,19,All those who know you among the nations are appalled at you. You have become an object of horror and will never exist again.”
Ezekiel,28,20,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,28,21,"“Son of man, turn your face toward Sidon and prophesy against it."
Ezekiel,28,22,"You are to say: This is what the Lord GOD says: Look! I am against you, Sidon, and I will display My glory within you. They will know that I am Yahweh when I execute judgments against her and demonstrate My holiness through her."
Ezekiel,28,23,"I will send a plague against her and bloodshed in her streets; the slain will fall within her, while the sword is against her on every side. Then they will know that I am Yahweh."
Ezekiel,28,24,“The house of Israel will no longer be hurt by prickly briers or painful thorns from all their neighbors who treat them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the Lord Yahweh.
Ezekiel,28,25,"“This is what the Lord GOD says: When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples where they are scattered and demonstrate My holiness through them in the sight of the nations, then they will live in their own land, which I gave to My servant Jacob."
Ezekiel,28,26,"They will live there securely, build houses, and plant vineyards. They will live securely when I execute judgments against all their neighbors who treat them with contempt. Then they will know that I am Yahweh their God.”"
Ezekiel,29,1,"In the tenth year, in the tenth month on the twelfth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:"
Ezekiel,29,2,"“Son of man, turn your face toward Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against him and against all of Egypt."
Ezekiel,29,3,"Speak to him and say: This is what the Lord GOD says: Look, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monster lying in the middle of his Nile, who says, ‘My Nile is my own; I made it for myself.’"
Ezekiel,29,4,"I will put hooks in your jaws and make the fish of your streams cling to your scales. I will haul you up from the middle of your Nile, and all the fish of your streams will cling to your scales."
Ezekiel,29,5,"I will leave you in the desert, you and all the fish of your streams. You will fall on the open ground and will not be taken away or gathered for burial. I have given you to the beasts of the earth and the birds of the sky as food."
Ezekiel,29,6,"Then all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Yahweh, for they have been a staff made of reed to the house of Israel."
Ezekiel,29,7,"When Israel grasped you by the hand, you splintered, tearing all their shoulders; when they leaned on you, you shattered and made all their hips unsteady."
Ezekiel,29,8,“Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: I am going to bring a sword against you and wipe out man and animal from you.
Ezekiel,29,9,"The land of Egypt will be a desolate ruin. Then they will know that I am Yahweh. Because you said, ‘The Nile is my own; I made it,’"
Ezekiel,29,10,"therefore, I am against you and your Nile. I will turn the land of Egypt into ruins, a desolate waste from Migdol to Syene, as far as the border of Cush."
Ezekiel,29,11,"No human foot will pass through it, and no animal foot will pass through it. It will be uninhabited for 40 years."
Ezekiel,29,12,"I will make the land of Egypt a desolation among desolate lands, and its cities will be a desolation among ruined cities for 40 years. I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them across the countries."
Ezekiel,29,13,“For this is what the Lord GOD says: At the end of 40 years I will gather the Egyptians from the nations where they were dispersed.
Ezekiel,29,14,"I will restore the fortunes of Egypt and bring them back to the land of Pathros, the land of their origin. There they will be a lowly kingdom."
Ezekiel,29,15,Egypt will be the lowliest of kingdoms and will never again exalt itself over the nations. I will make them so small they cannot rule over the nations.
Ezekiel,29,16,"It will never again be an object of trust for the house of Israel, drawing attention to their sin of turning to the Egyptians. Then they will know that I am the Lord Yahweh.”"
Ezekiel,29,17,"In the twenty-seventh year in the first month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:"
Ezekiel,29,18,"“Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made his army labor strenuously against Tyre. Every head was made bald and every shoulder chafed, but he and his army received no compensation from Tyre for the labor he expended against it."
Ezekiel,29,19,"Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: I am going to give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who will carry off its wealth, seizing its spoil and taking its plunder. This will be his army’s compensation."
Ezekiel,29,20,"I have given him the land of Egypt as the pay he labored for, since they worked for Me.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,29,21,"“In that day I will cause a horn to sprout for the house of Israel, and I will enable you to speak out among them. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.”"
Ezekiel,30,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,30,2,"“Son of man, prophesy and say: This is what the Lord GOD says: Wail: Woe for the day!"
Ezekiel,30,3,"For a day is near; a day belonging to the LORD is near. It will be a day of clouds, a time of doom for the nations."
Ezekiel,30,4,"A sword will come against Egypt, and there will be anguish in Cush when the slain fall in Egypt, and its wealth is taken away, and its foundations are torn down."
Ezekiel,30,5,"Cush, Put, and Lud, and all the various foreign troops, plus Libya and the men of the covenant land will fall by the sword along with them."
Ezekiel,30,6,"This is what the LORD says: Those who support Egypt will fall, and its proud strength will collapse. From Migdol to Syene they will fall within it by the sword. This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,30,7,"They will be desolate among desolate lands, and their cities will lie among ruined cities."
Ezekiel,30,8,They will know that I am Yahweh when I set fire to Egypt and all its allies are shattered.
Ezekiel,30,9,"On that day, messengers will go out from Me in ships to terrify confident Cush. Anguish will come over them on the day of Egypt’s doom. For indeed it is coming.”"
Ezekiel,30,10,This is what the Lord GOD says: I will put an end to the hordes of Egypt by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
Ezekiel,30,11,"He along with his people, ruthless men from the nations, will be brought in to destroy the land. They will draw their swords against Egypt and fill the land with the slain."
Ezekiel,30,12,"I will make the streams dry and sell the land into the hands of evil men. I will bring desolation on the land and everything in it by the hands of foreigners. I, Yahweh, have spoken."
Ezekiel,30,13,This is what the Lord GOD says: I will destroy the idols and put an end to the false gods in Memphis. There will no longer be a prince from the land of Egypt. So I will instill fear in that land.
Ezekiel,30,14,"I will make Pathros desolate, set fire to Zoan, and execute judgments on Thebes."
Ezekiel,30,15,"I will pour out My wrath on Pelusium, the stronghold of Egypt, and will wipe out the crowds of Thebes."
Ezekiel,30,16,"I will set fire to Egypt; Pelusium will writhe in anguish, Thebes will be breached, and Memphis will face foes in broad daylight."
Ezekiel,30,17,"The young men of On and Pi-beseth will fall by the sword, and those cities will go into captivity."
Ezekiel,30,18,"The day will be dark in Tehaphnehes, when I break the yoke of Egypt there and its proud strength comes to an end in the city. A cloud will cover Tehaphnehes, and its villages will go into captivity."
Ezekiel,30,19,"So I will execute judgments against Egypt, and they will know that I am Yahweh."
Ezekiel,30,20,"In the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:"
Ezekiel,30,21,"“Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt. Look, it has not been bandaged—no medicine has been applied and no splint put on to bandage it so that it can grow strong enough to handle a sword."
Ezekiel,30,22,"Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: Look! I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt. I will break his arms, both the strong one and the one already broken, and will make the sword fall from his hand."
Ezekiel,30,23,I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them among the countries.
Ezekiel,30,24,"I will strengthen the arms of Babylon’s king and place My sword in his hand. But I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he will groan before him as a mortally wounded man."
Ezekiel,30,25,"I will strengthen the arms of Babylon’s king, but Pharaoh’s arms will fall. They will know that I am Yahweh when I place My sword in the hand of Babylon’s king and he wields it against the land of Egypt."
Ezekiel,30,26,"When I disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them among the countries, they will know that I am Yahweh.”"
Ezekiel,31,1,"In the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:"
Ezekiel,31,2,"“Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his hordes: Who are you like in your greatness?"
Ezekiel,31,3,"Think of Assyria, a cedar in Lebanon, with beautiful branches and shady foliage and of lofty height. Its top was among the clouds."
Ezekiel,31,4,"The waters caused it to grow; the underground springs made it tall, directing their rivers all around the place where the tree was planted and sending their channels to all the trees of the field."
Ezekiel,31,5,"Therefore the cedar became greater in height than all the trees of the field. Its branches multiplied, and its boughs grew long as it spread them out because of the plentiful water."
Ezekiel,31,6,"All the birds of the sky nested in its branches, and all the animals of the field gave birth beneath its boughs; all the great nations lived in its shade."
Ezekiel,31,7,"It was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its limbs, for its roots extended to abundant water."
Ezekiel,31,8,"The cedars in God’s garden could not rival it; the pine trees couldn’t compare with its branches, nor could the plane trees match its boughs. No tree in the garden of God could compare with it in beauty."
Ezekiel,31,9,"I made it beautiful with its many limbs, and all the trees of Eden, which were in God’s garden, envied it."
Ezekiel,31,10,"“Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: Since it became great in height and set its top among the clouds, and it grew proud on account of its height,"
Ezekiel,31,11,I determined to hand it over to a ruler of nations; he would surely deal with it. I banished it because of its wickedness.
Ezekiel,31,12,"Foreigners, ruthless men from the nations, cut it down and left it lying. Its limbs fell on the mountains and in every valley; its boughs lay broken in all the earth’s ravines. All the peoples of the earth left its shade and abandoned it."
Ezekiel,31,13,"All the birds of the sky nested on its fallen trunk, and all the animals of the field were among its boughs."
Ezekiel,31,14,"This happened so that no trees planted beside water would become great in height and set their tops among the clouds, and so that no other well-watered trees would reach them in height. For they have all been consigned to death, to the underworld, among the people who descend to the Pit."
Ezekiel,31,15,"“This is what the Lord GOD says: I caused grieving on the day the cedar went down to Sheol. I closed off the underground deep because of it: I held back the rivers of the deep, and its abundant waters were restrained. I made Lebanon mourn on account of it, and all the trees of the field fainted because of it."
Ezekiel,31,16,"I made the nations quake at the sound of its downfall, when I threw it down to Sheol to be with those who descend to the Pit. Then all the trees of Eden, all the well-watered trees, the choice and best of Lebanon, were comforted in the underworld."
Ezekiel,31,17,"They too descended with it to Sheol, to those slain by the sword. As its allies they had lived in its shade among the nations."
Ezekiel,31,18,“Who then are you like in glory and greatness among Eden’s trees? You also will be brought down to the underworld to be with the trees of Eden. You will lie among the uncircumcised with those slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his hordes”—the declaration of the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel,32,1,"In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:"
Ezekiel,32,2,"“Son of man, lament for Pharaoh king of Egypt and say to him: You compare yourself to a lion of the nations, but you are like a monster in the seas. You thrash about in your rivers, churn up the waters with your feet, and muddy the rivers.”"
Ezekiel,32,3,"This is what the Lord GOD says: I will spread My net over you with an assembly of many peoples, and they will haul you up in My net."
Ezekiel,32,4,I will abandon you on the land and hurl you on the open field. I will cause all the birds of the sky to settle on you and let the beasts of the entire earth eat their fill of you.
Ezekiel,32,5,I will put your flesh on the mountains and fill the valleys with your carcass.
Ezekiel,32,6,"I will drench the land with the flow of your blood, even to the mountains; the ravines will be filled with your gore."
Ezekiel,32,7,"When I snuff you out, I will cover the heavens and darken their stars. I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon will not give its light."
Ezekiel,32,8,"I will darken all the shining lights in the heavens over you, and will bring darkness on your land. This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,32,9,"I will trouble the hearts of many peoples, when I bring about your destruction among the nations, in countries you do not know."
Ezekiel,32,10,"I will cause many nations to be appalled at you, and their kings will shudder with fear because of you when I brandish My sword in front of them. On the day of your downfall each of them will tremble every moment for his life."
Ezekiel,32,11,For this is what the Lord GOD says: The sword of Babylon’s king will come against you!
Ezekiel,32,12,"I will make your hordes fall by the swords of warriors, all of them ruthless men from the nations. They will ravage Egypt’s pride, and all its hordes will be destroyed."
Ezekiel,32,13,"I will slaughter all its cattle that are beside many waters. No human foot will churn them again, and no cattle hooves will disturb them."
Ezekiel,32,14,Then I will let their waters settle and will make their rivers flow like oil. This is the declaration of the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel,32,15,"When I make the land of Egypt a desolation, so that it is emptied of everything in it, when I strike down all who live there, then they will know that I am Yahweh."
Ezekiel,32,16,“This is a lament that will be chanted; the women of the nations will chant it. They will chant it over Egypt and all its hordes.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel,32,17,"In the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:"
Ezekiel,32,18,"“Son of man, wail over the hordes of Egypt and bring Egypt and the daughters of mighty nations down to the underworld, to be with those who descend to the Pit:"
Ezekiel,32,19,Who do you surpass in loveliness? Go down and be laid to rest with the uncircumcised!
Ezekiel,32,20,They will fall among those slain by the sword. A sword is appointed! They drag her and all her hordes away.
Ezekiel,32,21,Warrior leaders will speak from the middle of Sheol about him and his allies: They have come down; the uncircumcised lie slain by the sword.
Ezekiel,32,22,"Assyria is there with all her company; her graves are all around her. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword."
Ezekiel,32,23,"Her graves are set in the deepest regions of the Pit, and her company is all around her burial place. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword— those who once spread terror in the land of the living."
Ezekiel,32,24,"Elam is there with all her hordes around her grave. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword— those who went down to the underworld uncircumcised, who once spread their terror in the land of the living. They bear their disgrace with those who descend to the Pit."
Ezekiel,32,25,"Among the slain they prepare a resting place for Elam with all her hordes. Her graves are all around her. All of them are uncircumcised, slain by the sword, although their terror was once spread in the land of the living. They bear their disgrace with those who descend to the Pit. They are placed among the slain."
Ezekiel,32,26,"Meshech and Tubal are there, with all their hordes. Their graves are all around them. All of them are uncircumcised, slain by the sword, although their terror was once spread in the land of the living."
Ezekiel,32,27,"They do not lie down with the fallen warriors of the uncircumcised, who went down to Sheol with their weapons of war, whose swords were placed under their heads. The punishment for their sins rested on their bones, although the terror of these warriors was once in the land of the living."
Ezekiel,32,28,"But you will be shattered and will lie down among the uncircumcised, with those slain by the sword."
Ezekiel,32,29,"Edom is there, her kings and all her princes, who, despite their strength, have been placed among those slain by the sword. They lie down with the uncircumcised, with those who descend to the Pit."
Ezekiel,32,30,"All the leaders of the north and all the Sidonians are there. They went down in shame with the slain, despite the terror their strength inspired. They lie down uncircumcised with those slain by the sword. They bear their disgrace with those who descend to the Pit."
Ezekiel,32,31,"Pharaoh will see them and be comforted over all his hordes— Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword. This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,32,32,"For I will spread My terror in the land of the living, so Pharaoh and all his hordes will be laid to rest among the uncircumcised, with those slain by the sword.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,33,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,33,2,"“Son of man, speak to your people and tell them: Suppose I bring the sword against a land, and the people of that land select a man from among them, appointing him as their watchman,"
Ezekiel,33,3,and he sees the sword coming against the land and blows his trumpet to warn the people.
Ezekiel,33,4,"Then, if anyone hears the sound of the trumpet but ignores the warning, and the sword comes and takes him away, his blood will be on his own head."
Ezekiel,33,5,"Since he heard the sound of the trumpet but ignored the warning, his blood is on his own hands. If he had taken warning, he would have saved his life."
Ezekiel,33,6,"However, if the watchman sees the sword coming but doesn’t blow the trumpet, so that the people aren’t warned, and the sword comes and takes away their lives, then they have been taken away because of their iniquity, but I will hold the watchman accountable for their blood."
Ezekiel,33,7,"“As for you, son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel. When you hear a word from My mouth, give them a warning from Me."
Ezekiel,33,8,"If I say to the wicked, ‘Wicked one, you will surely die,’ but you do not speak out to warn him about his way, that wicked person will die for his iniquity, yet I will hold you responsible for his blood."
Ezekiel,33,9,"But if you warn a wicked person to turn from his way and he doesn’t turn from it, he will die for his iniquity, but you will have saved your life."
Ezekiel,33,10,"“Now as for you, son of man, say to the house of Israel: You have said this, ‘Our transgressions and our sins are heavy on us, and we are wasting away because of them! How then can we survive?’"
Ezekiel,33,11,"Tell them: As I live”—the declaration of the Lord GOD—“I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that the wicked person should turn from his way and live. Repent, repent of your evil ways! Why will you die, house of Israel?"
Ezekiel,33,12,"“Now, son of man, say to your people: The righteousness of the righteous person will not save him on the day of his transgression; neither will the wickedness of the wicked person cause him to stumble on the day he turns from his wickedness. The righteous person won’t be able to survive by his righteousness on the day he sins."
Ezekiel,33,13,"When I tell the righteous person that he will surely live, but he trusts in his righteousness and commits iniquity, then none of his righteousness will be remembered, and he will die because of the iniquity he has committed."
Ezekiel,33,14,"“So when I tell the wicked person, ‘You will surely die,’ but he repents of his sin and does what is just and right—"
Ezekiel,33,15,"he returns collateral, makes restitution for what he has stolen, and walks in the statutes of life without practicing iniquity—he will certainly live; he will not die."
Ezekiel,33,16,None of the sins he committed will be held against him. He has done what is just and right; he will certainly live.
Ezekiel,33,17,"“But your people say, ‘The Lord’s way isn’t fair,’ even though it is their own way that isn’t fair."
Ezekiel,33,18,"When a righteous person turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he will die on account of this."
Ezekiel,33,19,"But if a wicked person turns from his wickedness and does what is just and right, he will live because of this."
Ezekiel,33,20,"Yet you say, ‘The Lord’s way isn’t fair.’ I will judge each of you according to his ways, house of Israel.”"
Ezekiel,33,21,"In the twelfth year of our exile, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, a fugitive from Jerusalem came to me and reported, “The city has been taken!”"
Ezekiel,33,22,"Now the hand of the LORD had been on me the evening before the fugitive arrived, and He opened my mouth before the man came to me in the morning. So my mouth was opened and I was no longer mute."
Ezekiel,33,23,Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,33,24,"“Son of man, those who live in the ruins in the land of Israel are saying, ‘Abraham was only one person, yet he received possession of the land. But we are many; the land has been given to us as a possession.’"
Ezekiel,33,25,"Therefore say to them: This is what the Lord GOD says: You eat meat with blood in it, raise your eyes to your idols, and shed blood. Should you then receive possession of the land?"
Ezekiel,33,26,"You have relied on your swords, you have committed detestable acts, and each of you has defiled his neighbor’s wife. Should you then receive possession of the land?"
Ezekiel,33,27,"“Tell them this: This is what the Lord GOD says: As surely as I live, those who are in the ruins will fall by the sword, those in the open field I have given to wild animals to be devoured, and those in the strongholds and caves will die by plague."
Ezekiel,33,28,"I will make the land a desolate waste, and its proud strength will come to an end. The mountains of Israel will become desolate, with no one passing through."
Ezekiel,33,29,They will know that I am Yahweh when I make the land a desolate waste because of all the detestable acts they have committed.
Ezekiel,33,30,"“Now, son of man, your people are talking about you near the city walls and in the doorways of their houses. One person speaks to another, each saying to his brother, ‘Come and hear what the message is that comes from the LORD!’"
Ezekiel,33,31,"So My people come to you in crowds, sit in front of you, and hear your words, but they don’t obey them. Although they express love with their mouths, their hearts pursue dishonest profit."
Ezekiel,33,32,"Yes, to them you are like a singer of love songs who has a beautiful voice and plays skillfully on an instrument. They hear your words, but they don’t obey them."
Ezekiel,33,33,Yet when it comes—and it will definitely come—then they will know that a prophet has been among them.”
Ezekiel,34,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,34,2,"“Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy, and say to them: This is what the Lord GOD says to the shepherds: Woe to the shepherds of Israel, who have been feeding themselves! Shouldn’t the shepherds feed their flock?"
Ezekiel,34,3,"You eat the fat, wear the wool, and butcher the fattened animals, but you do not tend the flock."
Ezekiel,34,4,"You have not strengthened the weak, healed the sick, bandaged the injured, brought back the strays, or sought the lost. Instead, you have ruled them with violence and cruelty."
Ezekiel,34,5,They were scattered for lack of a shepherd; they became food for all the wild animals when they were scattered.
Ezekiel,34,6,"My flock went astray on all the mountains and every high hill. They were scattered over the whole face of the earth, and there was no one searching or seeking for them."
Ezekiel,34,7,"“Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD."
Ezekiel,34,8,"As I live”—the declaration of the Lord GOD—“because My flock has become prey and food for every wild animal since they lack a shepherd, for My shepherds do not search for My flock, and because the shepherds feed themselves rather than My flock,"
Ezekiel,34,9,"therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD!"
Ezekiel,34,10,"“This is what the Lord GOD says: Look, I am against the shepherds. I will demand My flock from them and prevent them from shepherding the flock. The shepherds will no longer feed themselves, for I will rescue My flock from their mouths so that they will not be food for them."
Ezekiel,34,11,"“For this is what the Lord GOD says: See, I Myself will search for My flock and look for them."
Ezekiel,34,12,"As a shepherd looks for his sheep on the day he is among his scattered flock, so I will look for My flock. I will rescue them from all the places where they have been scattered on a cloudy and dark day."
Ezekiel,34,13,"I will bring them out from the peoples, gather them from the countries, and bring them into their own land. I will shepherd them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines, and in all the inhabited places of the land."
Ezekiel,34,14,"I will tend them with good pasture, and their grazing place will be on Israel’s lofty mountains. There they will lie down in a good grazing place; they will feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel."
Ezekiel,34,15,I will tend My flock and let them lie down.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel,34,16,"“I will seek the lost, bring back the strays, bandage the injured, and strengthen the weak, but I will destroy the fat and the strong. I will shepherd them with justice."
Ezekiel,34,17,"“The Lord GOD says to you, My flock: I am going to judge between one sheep and another, between the rams and male goats."
Ezekiel,34,18,Isn’t it enough for you to feed on the good pasture? Must you also trample the rest of the pasture with your feet? Or isn’t it enough that you drink the clear water? Must you also muddy the rest with your feet?
Ezekiel,34,19,"Yet My flock has to feed on what your feet have trampled, and drink what your feet have muddied."
Ezekiel,34,20,"“Therefore, this is what the Lord GOD says to them: See, I Myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep."
Ezekiel,34,21,"Since you have pushed with flank and shoulder and butted all the weak ones with your horns until you scattered them all over,"
Ezekiel,34,22,"I will save My flock, and they will no longer be prey for you. I will judge between one sheep and another."
Ezekiel,34,23,"I will appoint over them a single shepherd, My servant David, and he will shepherd them. He will tend them himself and will be their shepherd."
Ezekiel,34,24,"I, Yahweh, will be their God, and My servant David will be a prince among them. I, Yahweh, have spoken."
Ezekiel,34,25,"“I will make a covenant of peace with them and eliminate dangerous animals in the land, so that they may live securely in the wilderness and sleep in the forest."
Ezekiel,34,26,I will make them and the area around My hill a blessing: I will send down showers in their season—showers of blessing.
Ezekiel,34,27,"The trees of the field will give their fruit, and the land will yield its produce; My flock will be secure in their land. They will know that I am Yahweh when I break the bars of their yoke and rescue them from the hands of those who enslave them."
Ezekiel,34,28,"They will no longer be prey for the nations, and the wild animals of the land will not consume them. They will live securely, and no one will frighten them."
Ezekiel,34,29,"I will establish for them a place renowned for its agriculture, and they will no longer be victims of famine in the land. They will no longer endure the insults of the nations."
Ezekiel,34,30,"Then they will know that I, Yahweh their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are My people.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,34,31,"“You are My flock, the human flock of My pasture, and I am your God.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,35,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,35,2,"“Son of man, turn your face toward Mount Seir and prophesy against it."
Ezekiel,35,3,"Say to it: This is what the Lord GOD says: Look! I am against you, Mount Seir. I will stretch out My hand against you and make you a desolate waste."
Ezekiel,35,4,"I will turn your cities into ruins, and you will become a desolation. Then you will know that I am Yahweh."
Ezekiel,35,5,"“Because you maintained an ancient hatred and handed over the Israelites to the power of the sword in the time of their disaster, the time of final punishment,"
Ezekiel,35,6,"therefore, as I live”—this is the declaration of the Lord GOD—“I will destine you for bloodshed, and it will pursue you. Since you did not hate bloodshed, it will pursue you."
Ezekiel,35,7,I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste and will cut off from it those who come and go.
Ezekiel,35,8,"I will fill its mountains with the slain; those slain by the sword will fall on your hills, in your valleys, and in all your ravines."
Ezekiel,35,9,I will make you a perpetual desolation; your cities will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.
Ezekiel,35,10,"“Because you said, ‘These two nations and two lands will be mine, and we will possess them’—though the LORD was there—"
Ezekiel,35,11,"therefore, as I live”—the declaration of the Lord GOD—“I will treat you according to the anger and jealousy you showed in your hatred of them. I will make Myself known among them when I judge you."
Ezekiel,35,12,"Then you will know that I, Yahweh, have heard all the blasphemies you uttered against the mountains of Israel, saying, ‘They are desolate. They have been given to us to devour!’"
Ezekiel,35,13,"You boasted against Me with your mouth, and spoke many words against Me. I heard it Myself!"
Ezekiel,35,14,"“This is what the Lord GOD says: While the whole world rejoices, I will make you a desolation."
Ezekiel,35,15,"Just as you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel because it became a desolation, so I will deal with you: you will become a desolation, Mount Seir, and so will all Edom in its entirety. Then they will know that I am Yahweh."
Ezekiel,36,1,"“Son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say: Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD."
Ezekiel,36,2,"This is what the Lord GOD says: Because the enemy has said about you, ‘Good! The ancient heights have become our possession,’"
Ezekiel,36,3,"therefore, prophesy and say: This is what the Lord GOD says: Because they have made you desolate and have trampled you from every side, so that you became a possession for the rest of the nations and an object of people’s gossip and slander,"
Ezekiel,36,4,"therefore, mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD. This is what the Lord GOD says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, to the desolate ruins and abandoned cities, which have become plunder and a mockery to the rest of the nations all around."
Ezekiel,36,5,"“This is what the Lord GOD says: Certainly in My burning zeal I speak against the rest of the nations and all of Edom, who took My land as their own possession with wholehearted rejoicing and utter contempt so that its pastureland became plunder."
Ezekiel,36,6,"Therefore, prophesy concerning the land of Israel and say to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys: This is what the Lord GOD says: Look, I speak in My burning zeal because you have endured the insults of the nations."
Ezekiel,36,7,Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: I swear that the nations all around you will endure their own insults.
Ezekiel,36,8,"“You, mountains of Israel, will produce your branches and bear your fruit for My people Israel, since their arrival is near."
Ezekiel,36,9,"Look! I am on your side; I will turn toward you, and you will be tilled and sown."
Ezekiel,36,10,"I will fill you with people, with the whole house of Israel in its entirety. The cities will be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt."
Ezekiel,36,11,"I will fill you with people and animals, and they will increase and be fruitful. I will make you inhabited as you once were and make you better off than you were before. Then you will know that I am Yahweh."
Ezekiel,36,12,"I will cause people, My people Israel, to walk on you; they will possess you, and you will be their inheritance. You will no longer deprive them of their children."
Ezekiel,36,13,"“This is what the Lord GOD says: Because people are saying to you, ‘You devour men and deprive your nation of children,’"
Ezekiel,36,14,"therefore, you will no longer devour men and deprive your nation of children.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,36,15,"“I will no longer allow the insults of the nations to be heard against you, and you will not have to endure the reproach of the peoples anymore; you will no longer cause your nation to stumble.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,36,16,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,36,17,"“Son of man, while the house of Israel lived in their land, they defiled it with their conduct and actions. Their behavior before Me was like menstrual impurity."
Ezekiel,36,18,"So I poured out My wrath on them because of the blood they had shed on the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols."
Ezekiel,36,19,"I dispersed them among the nations, and they were scattered among the countries. I judged them according to their conduct and actions."
Ezekiel,36,20,"When they came to the nations where they went, they profaned My holy name, because it was said about them, ‘These are the people of Yahweh, yet they had to leave His land in exile.’"
Ezekiel,36,21,"Then I had concern for My holy name, which the house of Israel profaned among the nations where they went."
Ezekiel,36,22,"“Therefore, say to the house of Israel: This is what the Lord GOD says: It is not for your sake that I will act, house of Israel, but for My holy name, which you profaned among the nations where you went."
Ezekiel,36,23,"I will honor the holiness of My great name, which has been profaned among the nations—the name you have profaned among them. The nations will know that I am Yahweh”—the declaration of the Lord GOD—“when I demonstrate My holiness through you in their sight."
Ezekiel,36,24,"“For I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries, and will bring you into your own land."
Ezekiel,36,25,"I will also sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your impurities and all your idols."
Ezekiel,36,26,I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.
Ezekiel,36,27,I will place My Spirit within you and cause you to follow My statutes and carefully observe My ordinances.
Ezekiel,36,28,"Then you will live in the land that I gave your fathers; you will be My people, and I will be your God."
Ezekiel,36,29,"I will save you from all your uncleanness. I will summon the grain and make it plentiful, and will not bring famine on you."
Ezekiel,36,30,"I will also make the fruit of the trees and the produce of the field plentiful, so that you will no longer experience reproach among the nations on account of famine."
Ezekiel,36,31,"“Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good, and you will loathe yourselves for your iniquities and detestable practices."
Ezekiel,36,32,"It is not for your sake that I will act”—the declaration of the Lord GOD—“let this be known to you. Be ashamed and humiliated because of your ways, house of Israel!"
Ezekiel,36,33,"“This is what the Lord GOD says: On the day I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the ruins will be rebuilt."
Ezekiel,36,34,The desolate land will be cultivated instead of lying desolate in the sight of everyone who passes by.
Ezekiel,36,35,"Then they will say, ‘This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden. The cities that were once ruined, desolate, and destroyed are now fortified and inhabited.’"
Ezekiel,36,36,"Then the nations that remain around you will know that I, Yahweh, have rebuilt what was destroyed and have replanted what was desolate. I, Yahweh, have spoken and I will do it."
Ezekiel,36,37,“This is what the Lord GOD says: I will respond to the house of Israel and do this for them: I will multiply them in number like a flock.
Ezekiel,36,38,"So the ruined cities will be filled with a flock of people, just as the flock of sheep for sacrifice is filled in Jerusalem during its appointed festivals. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.”"
Ezekiel,37,1,"The hand of the LORD was on me, and He brought me out by His Spirit and set me down in the middle of the valley; it was full of bones."
Ezekiel,37,2,"He led me all around them. There were a great many of them on the surface of the valley, and they were very dry."
Ezekiel,37,3,"Then He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” I replied, “Lord GOD, only You know.”"
Ezekiel,37,4,"He said to me, “Prophesy concerning these bones and say to them: Dry bones, hear the word of the LORD!"
Ezekiel,37,5,"This is what the Lord GOD says to these bones: I will cause breath to enter you, and you will live."
Ezekiel,37,6,"I will put tendons on you, make flesh grow on you, and cover you with skin. I will put breath in you so that you come to life. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.”"
Ezekiel,37,7,"So I prophesied as I had been commanded. While I was prophesying, there was a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bone to bone."
Ezekiel,37,8,"As I looked, tendons appeared on them, flesh grew, and skin covered them, but there was no breath in them."
Ezekiel,37,9,"He said to me, “Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man. Say to it: This is what the Lord GOD says: Breath, come from the four winds and breathe into these slain so that they may live!”"
Ezekiel,37,10,"So I prophesied as He commanded me; the breath entered them, and they came to life and stood on their feet, a vast army."
Ezekiel,37,11,"Then He said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Look how they say, ‘Our bones are dried up, and our hope has perished; we are cut off.’"
Ezekiel,37,12,"Therefore, prophesy and say to them: This is what the Lord GOD says: I am going to open your graves and bring you up from them, My people, and lead you into the land of Israel."
Ezekiel,37,13,"You will know that I am Yahweh, My people, when I open your graves and bring you up from them."
Ezekiel,37,14,"I will put My Spirit in you, and you will live, and I will settle you in your own land. Then you will know that I am Yahweh. I have spoken, and I will do it.” This is the declaration of the LORD."
Ezekiel,37,15,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,37,16,"“Son of man, take a single stick and write on it: Belonging to Judah and the Israelites associated with him. Then take another stick and write on it: Belonging to Joseph—the stick of Ephraim—and all the house of Israel associated with him."
Ezekiel,37,17,Then join them together into a single stick so that they become one in your hand.
Ezekiel,37,18,"When your people ask you, ‘Won’t you explain to us what you mean by these things?’—"
Ezekiel,37,19,"tell them: This is what the Lord GOD says: I am going to take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel associated with him, and put them together with the stick of Judah. I will make them into a single stick so that they become one in My hand."
Ezekiel,37,20,"“When the sticks you have written on are in your hand and in full view of the people,"
Ezekiel,37,21,tell them: This is what the Lord GOD says: I am going to take the Israelites out of the nations where they have gone. I will gather them from all around and bring them into their own land.
Ezekiel,37,22,"I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel, and one king will rule over all of them. They will no longer be two nations and will no longer be divided into two kingdoms."
Ezekiel,37,23,"They will not defile themselves anymore with their idols, their detestable things, and all their transgressions. I will save them from all their apostasies by which they sinned, and I will cleanse them. Then they will be My people, and I will be their God."
Ezekiel,37,24,"My servant David will be king over them, and there will be one shepherd for all of them. They will follow My ordinances, and keep My statutes and obey them."
Ezekiel,37,25,"“They will live in the land that I gave to My servant Jacob, where your fathers lived. They will live in it forever with their children and grandchildren, and My servant David will be their prince forever."
Ezekiel,37,26,I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant with them. I will establish and multiply them and will set My sanctuary among them forever.
Ezekiel,37,27,"My dwelling place will be with them; I will be their God, and they will be My people."
Ezekiel,37,28,"When My sanctuary is among them forever, the nations will know that I, Yahweh, sanctify Israel.”"
Ezekiel,38,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,38,2,"“Son of man, turn your face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal. Prophesy against him"
Ezekiel,38,3,"and say: This is what the Lord GOD says: Look, I am against you, Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal."
Ezekiel,38,4,"I will turn you around, put hooks in your jaws, and bring you out with all your army, including horses and riders, who are all splendidly dressed, a huge company armed with shields and bucklers, all of them brandishing swords."
Ezekiel,38,5,"Persia,Cush, and Put are with them, all of them with shields and helmets;"
Ezekiel,38,6,Gomer with all its troops; and Beth-togarmah from the remotest parts of the north along with all its troops—many peoples are with you.
Ezekiel,38,7,"“Be prepared and get yourself ready, you and all your company who have been mobilized around you; you will be their guard."
Ezekiel,38,8,"After a long time you will be summoned. In the last years you will enter a land that has been restored from war and regathered from many peoples to the mountains of Israel, which had long been a ruin. They were brought out from the peoples, and all of them now live securely."
Ezekiel,38,9,"You, all of your troops, and many peoples with you will advance, coming like a thunderstorm; you will be like a cloud covering the land."
Ezekiel,38,10,"“This is what the Lord GOD says: On that day, thoughts will arise in your mind, and you will devise an evil plan."
Ezekiel,38,11,"You will say, ‘I will go up against a land of open villages; I will come against a tranquil people who are living securely, all of them living without walls and without bars or gates—"
Ezekiel,38,12,"in order to seize spoil and carry off plunder, to turn your hand against ruins now inhabited and against a people gathered from the nations, who have been acquiring cattle and possessions and who live at the center of the world.’"
Ezekiel,38,13,"Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish with all its rulers will ask you, ‘Have you come to seize spoil? Have you assembled your hordes to carry off plunder, to make off with silver and gold, to take cattle and possessions, to seize great spoil?’"
Ezekiel,38,14,"“Therefore prophesy, son of man, and say to Gog: This is what the Lord GOD says: On that day when My people Israel are dwelling securely, will you not know this"
Ezekiel,38,15,"and come from your place in the remotest parts of the north—you and many peoples with you, who are all riding horses—a mighty horde, a huge army?"
Ezekiel,38,16,"You will advance against My people Israel like a cloud covering the land. It will happen in the last days, Gog, that I will bring you against My land so that the nations may know Me, when I show Myself holy through you in their sight."
Ezekiel,38,17,"“This is what the Lord GOD says: Are you the one I spoke about in former times through My servants, the prophets of Israel, who for years prophesied in those times that I would bring you against them?"
Ezekiel,38,18,"Now on that day, the day when Gog comes against the land of Israel”—this is the declaration of the Lord GOD—“My wrath will flare up."
Ezekiel,38,19,I swear in My zeal and fiery rage: On that day there will be a great earthquake in the land of Israel.
Ezekiel,38,20,"The fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the animals of the field, every creature that crawls on the ground, and every human being on the face of the earth will tremble before Me. The mountains will be thrown down, the cliffs will collapse, and every wall will fall to the ground."
Ezekiel,38,21,I will call for a sword against him on all My mountains”—the declaration of the Lord GOD—“and every man’s sword will be against his brother.
Ezekiel,38,22,"I will execute judgment on him with plague and bloodshed. I will pour out torrential rain, hailstones, fire, and brimstone on him, as well as his troops and the many peoples who are with him."
Ezekiel,38,23,"I will display My greatness and holiness, and will reveal Myself in the sight of many nations. Then they will know that I am Yahweh."
Ezekiel,39,1,"“As for you, son of man, prophesy against Gog and say: This is what the Lord GOD says: Look, I am against you, Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal."
Ezekiel,39,2,"I will turn you around, drive you on, and lead you up from the remotest parts of the north. I will bring you against the mountains of Israel."
Ezekiel,39,3,Then I will knock your bow from your left hand and make your arrows drop from your right hand.
Ezekiel,39,4,"You, all your troops, and the peoples who are with you will fall on the mountains of Israel. I will give you as food to every kind of predatory bird and to the wild animals."
Ezekiel,39,5,"You will fall on the open field, for I have spoken.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,39,6,“I will send fire against Magog and those who live securely on the coasts and islands. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.
Ezekiel,39,7,"So I will make My holy name known among My people Israel and will no longer allow it to be profaned. Then the nations will know that I am Yahweh, the Holy One in Israel."
Ezekiel,39,8,"Yes, it is coming, and it will happen.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD. “This is the day I have spoken about."
Ezekiel,39,9,"“Then the inhabitants of Israel’s cities will go out, kindle fires, and burn the weapons—the bucklers and shields, the bows and arrows, the clubs and spears. For seven years they will use them to make fires."
Ezekiel,39,10,"They will not gather wood from the countryside or cut it down from the forests, for they will use the weapons to make fires. They will take the loot from those who looted them and plunder those who plundered them.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,39,11,"“Now on that day I will give Gog a burial place there in Israel—the Valley of the Travelers east of the Sea. It will block those who travel through, for Gog and all his hordes will be buried there. So it will be called the Valley of Hamon-gog."
Ezekiel,39,12,The house of Israel will spend seven months burying them in order to cleanse the land.
Ezekiel,39,13,All the people of the land will bury them and their fame will spread on the day I display My glory.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel,39,14,"“They will appoint men on a full-time basis to pass through the land and bury the invaders who remain on the surface of the ground, in order to cleanse it. They will make their search at the end of the seven months."
Ezekiel,39,15,"When they pass through the land and one of them sees a human bone, he will set up a marker next to it until the buriers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon-gog."
Ezekiel,39,16,There will even be a city named Hamonah there. So they will cleanse the land.
Ezekiel,39,17,"“Son of man, this is what the Lord GOD says: Tell every kind of bird and all the wild animals: Assemble and come! Gather from all around to My sacrificial feast that I am slaughtering for you, a great feast on the mountains of Israel; you will eat flesh and drink blood."
Ezekiel,39,18,"You will eat the flesh of mighty men and drink the blood of the earth’s princes: rams, lambs, male goats, and all the fattened bulls of Bashan."
Ezekiel,39,19,"You will eat fat until you are satisfied and drink blood until you are drunk, at My sacrificial feast that I have prepared for you."
Ezekiel,39,20,"At My table you will eat your fill of horses and riders, of mighty men and all the warriors.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,39,21,"“I will display My glory among the nations, and all the nations will see the judgment I have executed and the hand I have laid on them."
Ezekiel,39,22,From that day forward the house of Israel will know that I am Yahweh their God.
Ezekiel,39,23,"And the nations will know that the house of Israel went into exile on account of their iniquity, because they dealt unfaithfully with Me. Therefore, I hid My face from them and handed them over to their enemies, so that they all fell by the sword."
Ezekiel,39,24,"I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and transgressions, and I hid My face from them."
Ezekiel,39,25,"“So this is what the Lord GOD says: Now I will restore the fortunes of Jacob and have compassion on the whole house of Israel, and I will be jealous for My holy name."
Ezekiel,39,26,"They will feel remorse for their disgrace and all the unfaithfulness they committed against Me, when they live securely in their land with no one to frighten them."
Ezekiel,39,27,"When I bring them back from the peoples and gather them from the countries of their enemies, I will demonstrate My holiness through them in the sight of many nations."
Ezekiel,39,28,They will know that I am Yahweh their God when I regather them to their own land after having exiled them among the nations. I will leave none of them behind.
Ezekiel,39,29,"I will no longer hide My face from them, for I will pour out My Spirit on the house of Israel.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,40,1,"In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month in the fourteenth year after Jerusalem had been captured, on that very day the LORD’s hand was on me, and He brought me there."
Ezekiel,40,2,In visions of God He took me to the land of Israel and set me down on a very high mountain. On its southern slope was a structure resembling a city.
Ezekiel,40,3,"He brought me there, and I saw a man whose appearance was like bronze, with a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand. He was standing by the gate."
Ezekiel,40,4,"He spoke to me: “Son of man, look with your eyes, listen with your ears, and pay attention to everything I am going to show you, for you have been brought here so that I might show it to you. Report everything you see to the house of Israel.”"
Ezekiel,40,5,"Now there was a wall surrounding the outside of the temple. The measuring rod in the man’s hand was six units of 21 inches; each unit was the standard length plus three inches. He measured the thickness of the wall structure; it was about 10 feet, and its height was the same."
Ezekiel,40,6,Then he came to the gate that faced east and climbed its steps. He measured the threshold of the gate; it was 10 feet deep—the first threshold was 10 feet deep.
Ezekiel,40,7,"Each recess was about 10 feet long and 10 feet deep, and there was a space of 8¾ feet between the recesses. The inner threshold of the gate on the temple side next to the gate’s portico was about 10 feet."
Ezekiel,40,8,Next he measured the portico of the gate;
Ezekiel,40,9,"it was 14 feet, and its pilasters were 3½ feet. The portico of the gate was on the temple side."
Ezekiel,40,10,"There were three recesses on each side of the east gate, each with the same measurements, and the pilasters on either side also had the same measurements."
Ezekiel,40,11,"Then he measured the width of the gate’s entrance; it was 17½ feet, while the width of the gateway was 22¾ feet."
Ezekiel,40,12,"There was a barrier of 21 inches in front of the recesses on both sides, and the recesses on each side were 10½ feet square."
Ezekiel,40,13,Then he measured the gateway from the roof of one recess to the roof of the opposite one; the distance was 43¾ feet. The openings of the recesses faced each other.
Ezekiel,40,14,"Next, he measured the pilasters—105 feet. The gate extended around to the pilaster of the court."
Ezekiel,40,15,The distance from the front of the gate at the entrance to the front of the gate’s portico on the inside was 87½ feet.
Ezekiel,40,16,The recesses and their pilasters had beveled windows all around the inside of the gateway. The porticoes also had windows all around on the inside. Each pilaster was decorated with palm trees.
Ezekiel,40,17,"Then he brought me into the outer court, and there were chambers and a paved surface laid out all around the court. Thirty chambers faced the pavement,"
Ezekiel,40,18,which flanked the gates and corresponded to the length of the gates; this was the lower pavement.
Ezekiel,40,19,Then he measured the distance from the front of the lower gate to the exterior front of the inner court; it was 175 feet. This was the east; next the north is described.
Ezekiel,40,20,"He measured the gate of the outer court facing north, both its length and width."
Ezekiel,40,21,"Its three recesses on each side, its pilasters, and its portico had the same measurements as the first gate: 87½ feet long and 43¾ feet wide."
Ezekiel,40,22,"Its windows, portico, and palm trees had the same measurements as those of the gate that faced east. Seven steps led up to the gate, and its portico was ahead of them."
Ezekiel,40,23,"The inner court had a gate facing the north gate, like the one on the east. He measured the distance from gate to gate; it was 175 feet."
Ezekiel,40,24,"He brought me to the south side, and there was also a gate on the south. He measured its pilasters and portico; they had the same measurements as the others."
Ezekiel,40,25,"Both the gate and its portico had windows all around, like the other windows. It was 87½ feet long and 43¾ feet wide."
Ezekiel,40,26,"Its stairway had seven steps, and its portico was ahead of them. It had palm trees on its pilasters, one on each side."
Ezekiel,40,27,The inner court had a gate on the south. He measured from gate to gate on the south; it was 175 feet.
Ezekiel,40,28,"Then he brought me to the inner court through the south gate. When he measured the south gate, it had the same measurements as the others."
Ezekiel,40,29,"Its recesses, pilasters, and portico had the same measurements as the others. Both it and its portico had windows all around. It was 87½ feet long and 43¾ feet wide."
Ezekiel,40,30,"(There were porticoes all around, 43¾ feet long and 8¾ feet wide.)"
Ezekiel,40,31,"Its portico faced the outer court, and its pilasters were decorated with palm trees. Its stairway had eight steps."
Ezekiel,40,32,"Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side. When he measured the gate, it had the same measurements as the others."
Ezekiel,40,33,"Its recesses, pilasters, and portico had the same measurements as the others. Both it and its portico had windows all around. It was 87½ feet long and 43¾ feet wide."
Ezekiel,40,34,"Its portico faced the outer court, and its pilasters were decorated with palm trees on each side. Its stairway had eight steps."
Ezekiel,40,35,"Then he brought me to the north gate. When he measured it, it had the same measurements as the others,"
Ezekiel,40,36,"as did its recesses, pilasters, and portico. It also had windows all around. It was 87½ feet long and 43¾ feet wide."
Ezekiel,40,37,"Its portico faced the outer court, and its pilasters were decorated with palm trees on each side. Its stairway had eight steps."
Ezekiel,40,38,There was a chamber whose door opened into the portico of the gate. The burnt offering was to be washed there.
Ezekiel,40,39,"Inside the portico of the gate there were two tables on each side, on which to slaughter the burnt offering, sin offering, and restitution offering."
Ezekiel,40,40,"Outside, as one approaches the entrance of the north gate, there were two tables on one side and two more tables on the other side of the gate’s portico."
Ezekiel,40,41,"So there were four tables inside the gate and four outside, eight tables in all on which the slaughtering was to be done."
Ezekiel,40,42,"There were also four tables of cut stone for the burnt offering, each 31½ inches long, 31½ inches wide, and 21 inches high. The utensils used to slaughter the burnt offerings and other sacrifices were placed on them."
Ezekiel,40,43,"There were three-inch hooks fastened all around the inside of the room, and the flesh of the offering was to be laid on the tables."
Ezekiel,40,44,"Outside the inner gate, within the inner court, there were chambers for the singers: one beside the north gate, facing south, and another beside the south gate, facing north."
Ezekiel,40,45,Then the man said to me: “This chamber that faces south is for the priests who keep charge of the temple.
Ezekiel,40,46,"The chamber that faces north is for the priests who keep charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, the ones from the sons of Levi who may approach the LORD to serve Him.”"
Ezekiel,40,47,"Next he measured the court. It was square, 175 feet long and 175 feet wide. The altar was in front of the temple."
Ezekiel,40,48,"Then he brought me to the portico of the temple and measured the pilasters of the portico; they were 8¾ feet thick on each side. The width of the gateway was 24½ feet, and the side walls of the gate were 5¼ feet wide on each side."
Ezekiel,40,49,"The portico was 35 feet across and 21 feet deep, and 10 steps led up to it. There were pillars by the pilasters, one on each side."
Ezekiel,41,1,Next he brought me into the great hall and measured the pilasters; on each side the width of the pilaster was 10½ feet.
Ezekiel,41,2,"The width of the entrance was 17½ feet, and the side walls of the entrance were 8¾ feet wide on each side. He also measured the length of the great hall, 70 feet, and the width, 35 feet."
Ezekiel,41,3,"He went inside the next room and measured the pilasters at the entrance; they were 3½ feet wide. The entrance was 10½ feet wide, and the width of the entrance’s side walls on each side was 12¼ feet."
Ezekiel,41,4,"He then measured the length of the room adjacent to the great hall, 35 feet, and the width, 35 feet. And he said to me, “This is the most holy place.”"
Ezekiel,41,5,Then he measured the wall of the temple; it was 10½ feet thick. The width of the side rooms all around the temple was seven feet.
Ezekiel,41,6,"The side rooms were arranged one above another in three stories of 30 rooms each. There were ledges on the wall of the temple all around to serve as supports for the side rooms, so that the supports would not be in the temple wall itself."
Ezekiel,41,7,"The side rooms surrounding the temple widened at each successive story, for the structure surrounding the temple went up by stages. This was the reason for the temple’s broadness as it rose. And so, one would go up from the lowest story to the highest by means of the middle one."
Ezekiel,41,8,I saw that the temple had a raised platform surrounding it; this foundation for the side rooms was 10½ feet high.
Ezekiel,41,9,The thickness of the outer wall of the side rooms was 8¾ feet. The free space between the side rooms of the temple
Ezekiel,41,10,and the outer chambers was 35 feet wide all around the temple.
Ezekiel,41,11,"The side rooms opened into the free space, one entrance toward the north and another to the south. The area of free space was 8¾ feet wide all around."
Ezekiel,41,12,"Now the building that faced the temple yard toward the west was 122½ feet wide. The wall of the building was 8¾ feet thick on all sides, and the building’s length was 157½ feet."
Ezekiel,41,13,"Then the man measured the temple; it was 175 feet long. In addition, the temple yard and the building, including its walls, were 175 feet long."
Ezekiel,41,14,The width of the front of the temple along with the temple yard to the east was 175 feet.
Ezekiel,41,15,The interior of the great hall and the porticoes of the court—
Ezekiel,41,16,"the thresholds, the beveled windows, and the balconies all around with their three levels opposite the threshold—were overlaid with wood on all sides. They were paneled from the ground to the windows (but the windows were covered),"
Ezekiel,41,17,"reaching to the top of the entrance, and as far as the inner temple and on the outside. On every wall all around, on the inside and outside, was a pattern"
Ezekiel,41,18,carved with cherubim and palm trees. There was a palm tree between each pair of cherubim. Each cherub had two faces:
Ezekiel,41,19,"a human face turned toward the palm tree on one side, and a lion’s face turned toward it on the other. They were carved throughout the temple on all sides."
Ezekiel,41,20,Cherubim and palm trees were carved from the ground to the top of the entrance and on the wall of the great hall.
Ezekiel,41,21,"The doorposts of the great hall were square, and the front of the sanctuary had the same appearance."
Ezekiel,41,22,"The altar was made of wood, 5¼ feet high and 3½ feet long. It had corners, and its length and sides were of wood. The man told me, “This is the table that stands before the LORD.”"
Ezekiel,41,23,"The great hall and the sanctuary each had a double door,"
Ezekiel,41,24,and each of the doors had two swinging panels. There were two panels for one door and two for the other.
Ezekiel,41,25,"Cherubim and palm trees were carved on the doors of the great hall like those carved on the walls. There was a wooden canopy outside, in front of the portico."
Ezekiel,41,26,"There were beveled windows and palm trees on both sides, on the side walls of the portico, the side rooms of the temple, and the canopies."
Ezekiel,42,1,Then the man led me out by way of the north gate into the outer court. He brought me to the group of chambers opposite the temple yard and opposite the building to the north.
Ezekiel,42,2,"Along the length of the chambers, which was 175 feet, there was an entrance on the north; the width was 87½ feet."
Ezekiel,42,3,"Opposite the 35 foot space belonging to the inner court and opposite the paved surface belonging to the outer court, the structure rose gallery by gallery in three tiers."
Ezekiel,42,4,"In front of the chambers was a walkway toward the inside, 17½ feet wide and 175 feet long, and their entrances were on the north."
Ezekiel,42,5,The upper chambers were narrower because the galleries took away more space from them than from the lower and middle stories of the building.
Ezekiel,42,6,For they were arranged in three stories and had no pillars like the pillars of the courts; therefore the upper chambers were set back from the ground more than the lower and middle stories.
Ezekiel,42,7,"A wall on the outside ran in front of the chambers, parallel to them, toward the outer court; it was 87½ feet long."
Ezekiel,42,8,"For the chambers on the outer court were 87½ feet long, while those facing the great hall were 175 feet long."
Ezekiel,42,9,At the base of these chambers there was an entryway on the east side as one enters them from the outer court.
Ezekiel,42,10,"In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the south, there were chambers facing the temple yard and the western building,"
Ezekiel,42,11,"with a passageway in front of them, just like the chambers that faced north. Their length and width, as well as all their exits, measurements, and entrances, were identical."
Ezekiel,42,12,"The entrance at the beginning of the passageway, the way in front of the corresponding wall as one enters on the east side, was similar to the entrances of the chambers that were on the south side."
Ezekiel,42,13,"Then the man said to me, “The northern and southern chambers that face the temple yard are the holy chambers where the priests who approach the LORD will eat the most holy offerings. There they will deposit the most holy offerings—the grain offerings, sin offerings, and restitution offerings—for the place is holy."
Ezekiel,42,14,"Once the priests have entered, they must not go out from the holy area to the outer court until they have removed the clothes they minister in, for these are holy. They are to put on other clothes before they approach the public area.”"
Ezekiel,42,15,"When he finished measuring inside the temple complex, he led me out by way of the gate that faced east and measured all around the complex."
Ezekiel,42,16,He measured the east side with a measuring rod; it was 875 feet by the measuring rod.
Ezekiel,42,17,He measured the north side; it was 875 feet by the measuring rod.
Ezekiel,42,18,He measured the south side; it was 875 feet by the measuring rod.
Ezekiel,42,19,Then he turned to the west side and measured 875 feet by the measuring rod.
Ezekiel,42,20,"He measured the temple complex on all four sides. It had a wall all around it, 875 feet long and 875 feet wide, to separate the holy from the common."
Ezekiel,43,1,"He led me to the gate, the one that faces east,"
Ezekiel,43,2,"and I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east. His voice sounded like the roar of mighty waters, and the earth shone with His glory."
Ezekiel,43,3,"The vision I saw was like the one I had seen when He came to destroy the city, and like the ones I had seen by the Chebar Canal. I fell facedown."
Ezekiel,43,4,The glory of the LORD entered the temple by way of the gate that faced east.
Ezekiel,43,5,"Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the inner court, and the glory of the LORD filled the temple."
Ezekiel,43,6,"While the man was standing beside me, I heard someone speaking to me from the temple."
Ezekiel,43,7,"He said to me: “Son of man, this is the place of My throne and the place for the soles of My feet, where I will dwell among the Israelites forever. The house of Israel and their kings will no longer defile My holy name by their religious prostitution and by the corpses of their kings at their high places."
Ezekiel,43,8,"Whenever they placed their threshold next to My threshold and their doorposts beside My doorposts, with only a wall between Me and them, they were defiling My holy name by the detestable acts they committed. So I destroyed them in My anger."
Ezekiel,43,9,"Now let them remove their prostitution and the corpses of their kings far from Me, and I will dwell among them forever."
Ezekiel,43,10,"“As for you, son of man, describe the temple to the house of Israel, so that they may be ashamed of their iniquities. Let them measure its pattern,"
Ezekiel,43,11,"and they will be ashamed of all that they have done. Reveal the design of the temple to them—its layout with its exits and entrances—its complete design along with all its statutes, design specifications, and laws. Write it down in their sight so that they may observe its complete design and all its statutes and may carry them out."
Ezekiel,43,12,"This is the law of the temple: all its surrounding territory on top of the mountain will be especially holy. Yes, this is the law of the temple."
Ezekiel,43,13,"“These are the measurements of the altar in units of length (each unit being the standard length plus three inches): the gutter is 21 inches deep and 21 inches wide, with a rim of nine inches around its edge. This is the base of the altar."
Ezekiel,43,14,"The distance from the gutter on the ground to the lower ledge is 3½ feet, and the width of the ledge is 21 inches. There are seven feet from the small ledge to the large ledge, whose width is also 21 inches."
Ezekiel,43,15,"The altar hearth is seven feet high, and four horns project upward from the hearth."
Ezekiel,43,16,"The hearth is square, 21 feet long by 21 feet wide."
Ezekiel,43,17,"The ledge is 24½ feet long by 24½ feet wide, with four equal sides. The rim all around it is 10½ inches, and its gutter is 21 inches all around it. The altar’s steps face east.”"
Ezekiel,43,18,"Then He said to me: “Son of man, this is what the Lord GOD says: These are the statutes for the altar on the day it is constructed, so that burnt offerings may be sacrificed on it and blood may be sprinkled on it:"
Ezekiel,43,19,"You are to give a bull from the herd as a sin offering to the Levitical priests who are from the offspring of Zadok, who approach Me in order to serve Me.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,43,20,"“You must take some of its blood and apply it to the four horns of the altar, the four corners of the ledge, and all around the rim. In this way you will purify the altar and make atonement for it."
Ezekiel,43,21,"Then you must take away the bull for the sin offering, and it must be burned outside the sanctuary in the place appointed for the temple."
Ezekiel,43,22,“On the second day you are to present an unblemished male goat as a sin offering. They will purify the altar just as they did with the bull.
Ezekiel,43,23,"When you have finished the purification, you are to present a young, unblemished bull and an unblemished ram from the flock."
Ezekiel,43,24,You must present them before the LORD; the priests will throw salt on them and sacrifice them as a burnt offering to the LORD.
Ezekiel,43,25,"You will offer a goat for a sin offering each day for seven days. A young bull and a ram from the flock, both unblemished, must also be offered."
Ezekiel,43,26,For seven days the priests are to make atonement for the altar and cleanse it. In this way they will consecrate it
Ezekiel,43,27,"and complete the days of purification. Then on the eighth day and afterward, the priests will offer your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar, and I will accept you.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,44,1,"The man then brought me back toward the sanctuary’s outer gate that faced east, and it was closed."
Ezekiel,44,2,"The LORD said to me: “This gate will remain closed. It will not be opened, and no one will enter through it, because the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered through it. Therefore it will remain closed."
Ezekiel,44,3,The prince himself will sit in the gateway to eat a meal before the LORD. He must enter by way of the portico of the gate and go out the same way.”
Ezekiel,44,4,"Then the man brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple. I looked, and the glory of the LORD filled His temple. And I fell facedown."
Ezekiel,44,5,"The LORD said to me: “Son of man, pay attention; look with your eyes and listen with your ears to everything I tell you about all the statutes and laws of the LORD’s temple. Take careful note of the entrance of the temple along with all the exits of the sanctuary."
Ezekiel,44,6,"“Say to the rebellious people, the house of Israel: This is what the Lord GOD says: I have had enough of all your detestable practices, house of Israel."
Ezekiel,44,7,"When you brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in both heart and flesh, to occupy My sanctuary, you defiled My temple while you offered My food—the fat and the blood. You broke My covenant by all your detestable practices."
Ezekiel,44,8,You have not kept charge of My holy things but have appointed others to keep charge of My sanctuary for you.
Ezekiel,44,9,"“This is what the Lord GOD says: No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and flesh, may enter My sanctuary, not even a foreigner who is among the Israelites."
Ezekiel,44,10,"Surely the Levites who wandered away from Me when Israel went astray, and who strayed from Me after their idols, will bear the consequences of their sin."
Ezekiel,44,11,"Yet they will occupy My sanctuary, serving as guards at the temple gates and ministering at the temple. They will slaughter the burnt offerings and other sacrifices for the people and will stand before them to serve them."
Ezekiel,44,12,"Because they ministered to the house of Israel before their idols and became a sinful stumbling block to them, therefore I swore an oath against them”—this is the declaration of the Lord GOD—“that they would bear the consequences of their sin."
Ezekiel,44,13,They must not approach Me to serve Me as priests or come near any of My holy things or the most holy things. They will bear their disgrace and the consequences of the detestable acts they committed.
Ezekiel,44,14,Yet I will make them responsible for the duties of the temple—for all its work and everything done in it.
Ezekiel,44,15,"“But the Levitical priests descended from Zadok, who kept charge of My sanctuary when the Israelites went astray from Me, will approach Me to serve Me. They will stand before Me to offer Me fat and blood.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,44,16,“They are the ones who may enter My sanctuary and draw near to My table to serve Me. They will keep My mandate.
Ezekiel,44,17,When they enter the gates of the inner court they must wear linen garments; they must not have on them anything made of wool when they minister at the gates of the inner court and within it.
Ezekiel,44,18,They must wear linen turbans on their heads and linen undergarments around their waists. They are not to put on anything that makes them sweat.
Ezekiel,44,19,"Before they go out to the outer court, to the people, they must take off the clothes they have been ministering in, leave them in the holy chambers, and dress in other clothes so that they do not transmit holiness to the people through their clothes."
Ezekiel,44,20,"“They may not shave their heads or let their hair grow long, but must carefully trim their hair."
Ezekiel,44,21,No priest may drink wine before he enters the inner court.
Ezekiel,44,22,"He is not to marry a widow or a divorced woman, but must marry a virgin from the offspring of the house of Israel, or a widow who is the widow of a priest."
Ezekiel,44,23,"They must teach My people the difference between the holy and the common, and explain to them the difference between the clean and the unclean."
Ezekiel,44,24,"“In a dispute, they will officiate as judges and decide the case according to My ordinances. They must observe My laws and statutes regarding all My appointed festivals, and keep My Sabbaths holy."
Ezekiel,44,25,"A priest may not come near a dead person so that he becomes defiled. However, he may defile himself for a father, a mother, a son, a daughter, a brother, or an unmarried sister."
Ezekiel,44,26,"After he is cleansed, he is to count off seven days for himself."
Ezekiel,44,27,"On the day he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court to minister in the sanctuary, he must present his sin offering.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,44,28,“This will be their inheritance: I am their inheritance. You are to give them no possession in Israel: I am their possession.
Ezekiel,44,29,"They will eat the grain offering, the sin offering, and the restitution offering. Everything in Israel that is permanently dedicated to the LORD will belong to them."
Ezekiel,44,30,The best of all the firstfruits of every kind and contribution of every kind from all your gifts will belong to the priests. You are to give your first batch of dough to the priest so that a blessing may rest on your homes.
Ezekiel,44,31,The priests may not eat any bird or animal that died naturally or was mauled by wild beasts.
Ezekiel,45,1,"“When you divide the land by lot as an inheritance, you must set aside a donation to the LORD, a holy portion of the land, 8⅓ miles long and 6⅔ miles wide. This entire tract of land will be holy."
Ezekiel,45,2,"In this area there will be a square section for the sanctuary, 875 by 875 feet, with 87½ feet of open space all around it."
Ezekiel,45,3,"From this holy portion, you will measure off an area 8⅓ miles long and 3⅓ miles wide, in which the sanctuary, the most holy place, will stand."
Ezekiel,45,4,"It will be a holy area of the land to be used by the priests who minister in the sanctuary, who draw near to serve the LORD. It will be a place for their houses, as well as a holy area for the sanctuary."
Ezekiel,45,5,There will be another area 8⅓ miles long and 3⅓ miles wide for the Levites who minister in the temple; it will be their possession for towns to live in.
Ezekiel,45,6,"“As the property of the city, you must set aside an area 1⅔ of a mile wide and 8⅓ miles long, adjacent to the holy donation of land. It will be for the whole house of Israel."
Ezekiel,45,7,"And the prince will have the area on each side of the holy donation of land and the city’s property, adjacent to the holy donation and the city’s property, stretching to the west on the west side and to the east on the east side. Its length will correspond to one of the tribal portions from the western boundary to the eastern boundary."
Ezekiel,45,8,This will be his land as a possession in Israel. My princes will no longer oppress My people but give the rest of the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
Ezekiel,45,9,"“This is what the Lord GOD says: You have gone too far, princes of Israel! Put away violence and oppression and do what is just and right. Put an end to your evictions of My people.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,45,10,"“You must have honest scales, an honest dry measure, and an honest liquid measure."
Ezekiel,45,11,"The dry measure and the liquid measure will be uniform, with the liquid measure containing 5½ gallons and the dry measure holding half a bushel. Their measurement will be a tenth of the standard larger capacity measure."
Ezekiel,45,12,The shekel will weigh 20 gerahs. Your mina will equal 60 shekels.
Ezekiel,45,13,“This is the contribution you are to offer: Three quarts from five bushels of wheat and three quarts from five bushels of barley.
Ezekiel,45,14,"The quota of oil in liquid measures will be one percent of every cor. The cor equals 10 liquid measures or one standard larger capacity measure, since 10 liquid measures equal one standard larger capacity measure."
Ezekiel,45,15,"And the quota from the flock is one animal out of every 200 from the well-watered pastures of Israel. These are for the grain offerings, burnt offerings, and fellowship offerings, to make atonement for the people.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,45,16,“All the people of the land must take part in this contribution for the prince in Israel.
Ezekiel,45,17,"Then the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings for the festivals, New Moons, and Sabbaths—for all the appointed times of the house of Israel—will be the prince’s responsibility. He will provide the sin offerings, grain offerings, burnt offerings, and fellowship offerings to make atonement on behalf of the house of Israel."
Ezekiel,45,18,"“This is what the Lord GOD says: In the first month, on the first day of the month, you are to take a young, unblemished bull and purify the sanctuary."
Ezekiel,45,19,"The priest must take some of the blood from the sin offering and apply it to the temple doorposts, the four corners of the altar’s ledge, and the doorposts of the gate to the inner court."
Ezekiel,45,20,You must do the same thing on the seventh day of the month for everyone who sins unintentionally or through ignorance. In this way you will make atonement for the temple.
Ezekiel,45,21,"“In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you are to celebrate the Passover, a festival of seven days during which unleavened bread will be eaten."
Ezekiel,45,22,On that day the prince will provide a bull as a sin offering on behalf of himself and all the people of the land.
Ezekiel,45,23,"During the seven days of the festival, he will provide seven bulls and seven rams without blemish as a burnt offering to the LORD on each of the seven days, along with a male goat each day for a sin offering."
Ezekiel,45,24,"He will also provide a grain offering of half a bushel per bull and half a bushel per ram, along with a gallon of oil for every half bushel."
Ezekiel,45,25,"At the festival that begins on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, he will provide the same things for seven days—the same sin offerings, burnt offerings, grain offerings, and oil."
Ezekiel,46,1,"“This is what the Lord GOD says: The gate of the inner court that faces east must be closed during the six days of work, but it will be opened on the Sabbath day and opened on the day of the New Moon."
Ezekiel,46,2,"The prince should enter from the outside by way of the gate’s portico and stand at the doorpost of the gate while the priests sacrifice his burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. He will bow in worship at the threshold of the gate and then depart, but the gate must not be closed until evening."
Ezekiel,46,3,The people of the land will also bow in worship before the LORD at the entrance of that gate on the Sabbaths and New Moons.
Ezekiel,46,4,“The burnt offering that the prince presents to the LORD on the Sabbath day is to be six unblemished lambs and an unblemished ram.
Ezekiel,46,5,"The grain offering will be half a bushel with the ram, and the grain offering with the lambs will be whatever he wants to give, as well as a gallon of oil for every half bushel."
Ezekiel,46,6,"On the day of the New Moon, the burnt offering is to be a young, unblemished bull, as well as six lambs and a ram without blemish."
Ezekiel,46,7,"He will provide a grain offering of half a bushel with the bull, half a bushel with the ram, and whatever he can afford with the lambs, together with a gallon of oil for every half bushel."
Ezekiel,46,8,"When the prince enters, he must go in by way of the gate’s portico and go out the same way."
Ezekiel,46,9,"“When the people of the land come before the LORD at the appointed times, whoever enters by way of the north gate to worship must go out by way of the south gate, and whoever enters by way of the south gate must go out by way of the north gate. No one must return through the gate by which he entered, but must go out by the opposite gate."
Ezekiel,46,10,"When the people enter, the prince will enter with them, and when they leave, he will leave."
Ezekiel,46,11,"At the festivals and appointed times, the grain offering will be half a bushel with the bull, half a bushel with the ram, and whatever he wants to give with the lambs, along with a gallon of oil for every half bushel."
Ezekiel,46,12,"“When the prince makes a freewill offering, whether a burnt offering or a fellowship offering as a freewill offering to the LORD, the gate that faces east must be opened for him. He is to offer his burnt offering or fellowship offering just as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he will go out, and the gate must be closed after he leaves."
Ezekiel,46,13,“You must offer an unblemished year-old male lamb as a daily burnt offering to the LORD; you will offer it every morning.
Ezekiel,46,14,"You must also prepare a grain offering every morning along with it: three quarts, with one-third of a gallon of oil to moisten the fine flour—a grain offering to the LORD. This is a permanent statute to be observed regularly."
Ezekiel,46,15,"They will offer the lamb, the grain offering, and the oil every morning as a regular burnt offering."
Ezekiel,46,16,"“This is what the Lord GOD says: If the prince gives a gift to each of his sons as their inheritance, it will belong to his sons. It will become their property by inheritance."
Ezekiel,46,17,"But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, it will belong to that servant until the year of freedom, when it will revert to the prince. His inheritance belongs only to his sons; it is theirs."
Ezekiel,46,18,"The prince must not take any of the people’s inheritance, evicting them from their property. He is to provide an inheritance for his sons from his own property, so that none of My people will be displaced from his own property.”"
Ezekiel,46,19,"Then he brought me through the entrance that was at the side of the gate, into the priests’ holy chambers, which faced north. I saw a place there at the far western end."
Ezekiel,46,20,"He said to me, “This is the place where the priests will boil the restitution offering and the sin offering, and where they will bake the grain offering, so that they do not bring them into the outer court and transmit holiness to the people.”"
Ezekiel,46,21,Next he brought me into the outer court and led me past its four corners. There was a separate court in each of its corners.
Ezekiel,46,22,"In the four corners of the outer court there were enclosed courts, 70 feet long by 52½ feet wide. All four corner areas had the same dimensions."
Ezekiel,46,23,"There was a stone wall around the inside of them, around the four of them, with ovens built at the base of the walls on all sides."
Ezekiel,46,24,He said to me: “These are the kitchens where those who minister at the temple will cook the people’s sacrifices.”
Ezekiel,47,1,"Then he brought me back to the entrance of the temple and there was water flowing from under the threshold of the temple toward the east, for the temple faced east. The water was coming down from under the south side of the threshold of the temple, south of the altar."
Ezekiel,47,2,Next he brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around the outside to the outer gate that faced east; there the water was trickling from the south side.
Ezekiel,47,3,"As the man went out east with a measuring line in his hand, he measured off a third of a mile and led me through the water. It came up to my ankles."
Ezekiel,47,4,Then he measured off a third of a mile and led me through the water. It came up to my knees. He measured off another third of a mile and led me through the water. It came up to my waist.
Ezekiel,47,5,"Again he measured off a third of a mile, and it was a river that I could not cross on foot. For the water had risen; it was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be crossed on foot."
Ezekiel,47,6,"He asked me, “Do you see this, son of man?” Then he led me back to the bank of the river."
Ezekiel,47,7,"When I had returned, I saw a very large number of trees along both sides of the riverbank."
Ezekiel,47,8,"He said to me, “This water flows out to the eastern region and goes down to the Arabah. When it enters the sea, the sea of foul water, the water of the sea becomes fresh."
Ezekiel,47,9,"Every kind of living creature that swarms will live wherever the river flows, and there will be a huge number of fish because this water goes there. Since the water will become fresh, there will be life everywhere the river goes."
Ezekiel,47,10,"Fishermen will stand beside it from En-gedi to En-eglaim. These will become places where nets are spread out to dry. Their fish will consist of many different kinds, like the fish of the Mediterranean Sea."
Ezekiel,47,11,Yet its swamps and marshes will not be healed; they will be left for salt.
Ezekiel,47,12,"All kinds of trees providing food will grow along both banks of the river. Their leaves will not wither, and their fruit will not fail. Each month they will bear fresh fruit because the water comes from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be used for food and their leaves for medicine.”"
Ezekiel,47,13,This is what the Lord GOD says: “This is the border you will use to divide the land as an inheritance for the 12 tribes of Israel. Joseph will receive two shares.
Ezekiel,47,14,"You will inherit it in equal portions, since I swore to give it to your ancestors. So this land will fall to you as an inheritance."
Ezekiel,47,15,"“This is to be the border of the land: On the north side it will extend from the Mediterranean Sea by way of Hethlon and Lebo-hamath to Zedad,"
Ezekiel,47,16,"Berothah, and Sibraim (which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath), as far as Hazer-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran."
Ezekiel,47,17,"So the border will run from the sea to Hazar-enon at the border of Damascus, with the territory of Hamath to the north. This will be the northern side."
Ezekiel,47,18,"On the east side it will run between Hauran and Damascus, along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel; you will measure from the northern border to the eastern sea. This will be the eastern side."
Ezekiel,47,19,"On the south side it will run from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh, and on to the Brook of Egypt as far as the Mediterranean Sea. This will be the southern side."
Ezekiel,47,20,"On the west side the Mediterranean Sea will be the border, from the southern border up to a point opposite Lebo-hamath. This will be the western side."
Ezekiel,47,21,“You are to divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.
Ezekiel,47,22,"You will allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the foreigners living among you, who have fathered children among you. You will treat them like native-born Israelites; along with you, they will be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel."
Ezekiel,47,23,"In whatever tribe the foreigner lives, you will assign his inheritance there.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,48,1,"“Now these are the names of the tribes: From the northern end, along the road of Hethlon, to Lebo-hamath as far as Hazar-enon, at the northern border of Damascus, alongside Hamath and extending from the eastern side to the sea, will be Dan—one portion."
Ezekiel,48,2,"Next to the territory of Dan, from the east side to the west, will be Asher—one portion."
Ezekiel,48,3,"Next to the territory of Asher, from the east side to the west, will be Naphtali—one portion."
Ezekiel,48,4,"Next to the territory of Naphtali, from the east side to the west, will be Manasseh—one portion."
Ezekiel,48,5,"Next to the territory of Manasseh, from the east side to the west, will be Ephraim—one portion."
Ezekiel,48,6,"Next to the territory of Ephraim, from the east side to the west, will be Reuben—one portion."
Ezekiel,48,7,"Next to the territory of Reuben, from the east side to the west, will be Judah—one portion."
Ezekiel,48,8,"“Next to the territory of Judah, from the east side to the west, will be the portion you donate to the LORD, 8⅓ miles wide, and as long as one of the tribal portions from the east side to the west. The sanctuary will be in the middle of it."
Ezekiel,48,9,“The special portion you donate to the LORD will be 8⅓ miles long and 3⅓ miles wide.
Ezekiel,48,10,"This holy donation will be set apart for the priests alone. It will be 8⅓ miles long on the northern side, 3⅓ miles wide on the western side, 3⅓ miles wide on the eastern side, and 8⅓ miles long on the southern side. The LORD’s sanctuary will be in the middle of it."
Ezekiel,48,11,"It is for the consecrated priests, the sons of Zadok, who kept My charge and did not go astray as the Levites did when the Israelites went astray."
Ezekiel,48,12,"It will be a special donation for them out of the holy donation of the land, a most holy place adjacent to the territory of the Levites."
Ezekiel,48,13,"“Next to the territory of the priests, the Levites will have an area 8⅓ miles long and 3⅓ miles wide. The total length will be 8⅓ miles and the width 3⅓ miles."
Ezekiel,48,14,"They must not sell or exchange any of it, and they must not transfer this choice part of the land, for it is holy to the LORD."
Ezekiel,48,15,"“The remaining area, 1⅔ of a mile wide and 8⅓ miles long, will be for common use by the city, for both residential and open space. The city will be in the middle of it."
Ezekiel,48,16,These are the city’s measurements: 1½ miles on the north side; 1½ miles on the south side; 1½ miles on the east side; and 1½ miles on the west side.
Ezekiel,48,17,"The city’s open space will extend: 425 feet to the north, 425 feet to the south, 425 feet to the east, and 425 feet to the west."
Ezekiel,48,18,“The remainder of the length alongside the holy donation will be 3⅓ miles to the east and 3⅓ miles to the west. It will run alongside the holy donation. Its produce will be food for the workers of the city.
Ezekiel,48,19,The city’s workers from all the tribes of Israel will cultivate it.
Ezekiel,48,20,The entire donation will be 8⅓ miles by 8⅓ miles; you are to set apart the holy donation along with the city property as a square area.
Ezekiel,48,21,"“The remaining area on both sides of the holy donation and the city property will belong to the prince. He will own the land adjacent to the tribal portions, next to the 8⅓ miles of the donation as far as the eastern border and next to the 8⅓ miles of the donation as far as the western border. The holy donation and the sanctuary of the temple will be in the middle of it."
Ezekiel,48,22,"Except for the Levitical property and the city property in the middle of the area belonging to the prince, the area between the territory of Judah and that of Benjamin will belong to the prince."
Ezekiel,48,23,"“As for the rest of the tribes: From the east side to the west, will be Benjamin—one portion."
Ezekiel,48,24,"Next to the territory of Benjamin, from the east side to the west, will be Simeon—one portion."
Ezekiel,48,25,"Next to the territory of Simeon, from the east side to the west, will be Issachar—one portion."
Ezekiel,48,26,"Next to the territory of Issachar, from the east side to the west, will be Zebulun—one portion."
Ezekiel,48,27,"Next to the territory of Zebulun, from the east side to the west, will be Gad—one portion."
Ezekiel,48,28,"Next to the territory of Gad toward the south side, the border will run from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the Brook of Egypt, and out to the Mediterranean Sea."
Ezekiel,48,29,"This is the land you are to allot as an inheritance to Israel’s tribes, and these will be their portions.” This is the declaration of the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,48,30,"“These are the exits of the city: On the north side, which measures 1½ miles,"
Ezekiel,48,31,"there will be three gates facing north, the gates of the city being named for the tribes of Israel: one, the gate of Reuben; one, the gate of Judah; and one, the gate of Levi."
Ezekiel,48,32,"On the east side, which is 1½ miles, there will be three gates: one, the gate of Joseph; one, the gate of Benjamin; and one, the gate of Dan."

Daniel,1,1,"In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and laid siege to it."
Daniel,1,2,"The Lord handed Jehoiakim king of Judah over to him, along with some of the vessels from the house of God. Nebuchadnezzar carried them to the land of Babylon, to the house of his god, and put the vessels in the treasury of his god."
Daniel,1,3,"The king ordered Ashpenaz, the chief of his court officials, to bring some of the Israelites from the royal family and from the nobility—"
Daniel,1,4,"young men without any physical defect, good-looking, suitable for instruction in all wisdom, knowledgeable, perceptive, and capable of serving in the king’s palace—and to teach them the Chaldean language and literature."
Daniel,1,5,"The king assigned them daily provisions from the royal food and from the wine that he drank. They were to be trained for three years, and at the end of that time they were to serve in the king’s court."
Daniel,1,6,"Among them, from the descendants of Judah, were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah."
Daniel,1,7,"The chief official gave them other names: he gave the name Belteshazzar to Daniel, Shadrach to Hananiah, Meshach to Mishael, and Abednego to Azariah."
Daniel,1,8,Daniel determined that he would not defile himself with the king’s food or with the wine he drank. So he asked permission from the chief official not to defile himself.
Daniel,1,9,"God had granted Daniel favor and compassion from the chief official,"
Daniel,1,10,"yet he said to Daniel, “My lord the king assigned your food and drink. I’m afraid of what would happen if he saw your faces looking thinner than those of the other young men your age. You would endanger my life with the king.”"
Daniel,1,11,"So Daniel said to the guard whom the chief official had assigned to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,"
Daniel,1,12,“Please test your servants for 10 days. Let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink.
Daniel,1,13,"Then examine our appearance and the appearance of the young men who are eating the king’s food, and deal with your servants based on what you see.”"
Daniel,1,14,He agreed with them about this and tested them for 10 days.
Daniel,1,15,At the end of 10 days they looked better and healthier than all the young men who were eating the king’s food.
Daniel,1,16,So the guard continued to remove their food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables.
Daniel,1,17,God gave these four young men knowledge and understanding in every kind of literature and wisdom. Daniel also understood visions and dreams of every kind.
Daniel,1,18,"At the end of the time that the king had said to present them, the chief official presented them to Nebuchadnezzar."
Daniel,1,19,"The king interviewed them, and among all of them, no one was found equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they began to serve in the king’s court."
Daniel,1,20,"In every matter of wisdom and understanding that the king consulted them about, he found them 10 times better than all the diviner-priests and mediums in his entire kingdom."
Daniel,1,21,Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.
Daniel,2,1,"In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams that troubled him, and sleep deserted him."
Daniel,2,2,"So the king gave orders to summon the diviner-priests, mediums, sorcerers, and Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams. When they came and stood before the king,"
Daniel,2,3,"he said to them, “I have had a dream and am anxious to understand it.”"
Daniel,2,4,"The Chaldeans spoke to the king (Aramaic begins here): “May the king live forever. Tell your servants the dream, and we will give the interpretation.”"
Daniel,2,5,"The king replied to the Chaldeans, “My word is final: If you don’t tell me the dream and its interpretation, you will be torn limb from limb, and your houses will be made a garbage dump."
Daniel,2,6,"But if you make the dream and its interpretation known to me, you’ll receive gifts, a reward, and great honor from me. So make the dream and its interpretation known to me.”"
Daniel,2,7,"They answered a second time, “May the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will give the interpretation.”"
Daniel,2,8,"The king replied, “I know for certain you are trying to gain some time, because you see that my word is final."
Daniel,2,9,"If you don’t tell me the dream, there is one decree for you. You have conspired to tell me something false or fraudulent until the situation changes. So tell me the dream and I will know you can give me its interpretation.”"
Daniel,2,10,"The Chaldeans answered the king, “No one on earth can make known what the king requests. Consequently, no king, however great and powerful, has ever asked anything like this of any diviner-priest, medium, or Chaldean."
Daniel,2,11,"What the king is asking is so difficult that no one can make it known to him except the gods, whose dwelling is not with mortals.”"
Daniel,2,12,"Because of this, the king became violently angry and gave orders to destroy all the wise men of Babylon."
Daniel,2,13,"The decree was issued that the wise men were to be executed, and they searched for Daniel and his friends, to execute them."
Daniel,2,14,"Then Daniel responded with tact and discretion to Arioch, the commander of the king’s guard, who had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon."
Daniel,2,15,"He asked Arioch, the king’s officer, “Why is the decree from the king so harsh?” Then Arioch explained the situation to Daniel."
Daniel,2,16,"So Daniel went and asked the king to give him some time, so that he could give the king the interpretation."
Daniel,2,17,"Then Daniel went to his house and told his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah about the matter,"
Daniel,2,18,"urging them to ask the God of heaven for mercy concerning this mystery, so Daniel and his friends would not be killed with the rest of Babylon’s wise men."
Daniel,2,19,"The mystery was then revealed to Daniel in a vision at night, and Daniel praised the God of heaven"
Daniel,2,20,"and declared: May the name of God be praised forever and ever, for wisdom and power belong to Him."
Daniel,2,21,He changes the times and seasons; He removes kings and establishes kings. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding.
Daniel,2,22,"He reveals the deep and hidden things; He knows what is in the darkness, and light dwells with Him."
Daniel,2,23,"I offer thanks and praise to You, God of my fathers, because You have given me wisdom and power. And now You have let me know what we asked of You, for You have let us know the king’s mystery."
Daniel,2,24,"Therefore Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had assigned to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He came and said to him, “Don’t kill the wise men of Babylon! Bring me before the king, and I will give him the interpretation.”"
Daniel,2,25,"Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king and said to him, “I have found a man among the Judean exiles who can let the king know the interpretation.”"
Daniel,2,26,"The king said in reply to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to tell me the dream I had and its interpretation?”"
Daniel,2,27,"Daniel answered the king: “No wise man, medium, diviner-priest, or astrologer is able to make known to the king the mystery he asked about."
Daniel,2,28,"But there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and He has let King Nebuchadnezzar know what will happen in the last days. Your dream and the visions that came into your mind as you lay in bed were these:"
Daniel,2,29,"Your Majesty, while you were in your bed, thoughts came to your mind about what will happen in the future. The revealer of mysteries has let you know what will happen."
Daniel,2,30,"As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have more wisdom than anyone living, but in order that the interpretation might be made known to the king, and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind."
Daniel,2,31,"“My king, as you were watching, a colossal statue appeared. That statue, tall and dazzling, was standing in front of you, and its appearance was terrifying."
Daniel,2,32,"The head of the statue was pure gold, its chest and arms were silver, its stomach and thighs were bronze,"
Daniel,2,33,"its legs were iron, and its feet were partly iron and partly fired clay."
Daniel,2,34,"As you were watching, a stone broke off without a hand touching it, struck the statue on its feet of iron and fired clay, and crushed them."
Daniel,2,35,"Then the iron, the fired clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were shattered and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors. The wind carried them away, and not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth."
Daniel,2,36,“This was the dream; now we will tell the king its interpretation.
Daniel,2,37,"Your Majesty, you are king of kings. The God of heaven has given you sovereignty, power, strength, and glory."
Daniel,2,38,"Wherever people live—or wild animals, or birds of the air—He has handed them over to you and made you ruler over them all. You are the head of gold."
Daniel,2,39,"“After you, there will arise another kingdom, inferior to yours, and then another, a third kingdom, of bronze, which will rule the whole earth."
Daniel,2,40,"A fourth kingdom will be as strong as iron; for iron crushes and shatters everything, and like iron that smashes, it will crush and smash all the others."
Daniel,2,41,"You saw the feet and toes, partly of a potter’s fired clay and partly of iron—it will be a divided kingdom, though some of the strength of iron will be in it. You saw the iron mixed with clay,"
Daniel,2,42,"and that the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly fired clay—part of the kingdom will be strong, and part will be brittle."
Daniel,2,43,"You saw the iron mixed with clay—the peoples will mix with one another but will not hold together, just as iron does not mix with fired clay."
Daniel,2,44,"“In the days of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, and this kingdom will not be left to another people. It will crush all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, but will itself endure forever."
Daniel,2,45,"You saw a stone break off from the mountain without a hand touching it, and it crushed the iron, bronze, fired clay, silver, and gold. The great God has told the king what will happen in the future. The dream is true, and its interpretation certain.”"
Daniel,2,46,"Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell down, paid homage to Daniel, and gave orders to present an offering and incense to him."
Daniel,2,47,"The king said to Daniel, “Your God is indeed God of gods, Lord of kings, and a revealer of mysteries, since you were able to reveal this mystery.”"
Daniel,2,48,Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many generous gifts. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon.
Daniel,2,49,"At Daniel’s request, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to manage the province of Babylon. But Daniel remained at the king’s court."
Daniel,3,1,"King Nebuchadnezzar made a gold statue, 90 feet high and nine feet wide. He set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon."
Daniel,3,2,"King Nebuchadnezzar sent word to assemble the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the rulers of the provinces to attend the dedication of the statue King Nebuchadnezzar had set up."
Daniel,3,3,"So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the rulers of the provinces assembled for the dedication of the statue the king had set up. Then they stood before the statue Nebuchadnezzar had set up."
Daniel,3,4,"A herald loudly proclaimed, “People of every nation and language, you are commanded:"
Daniel,3,5,"When you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, drum, and every kind of music, you are to fall down and worship the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up."
Daniel,3,6,But whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire.”
Daniel,3,7,"Therefore, when all the people heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, and every kind of music, people of every nation and language fell down and worshiped the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up."
Daniel,3,8,Some Chaldeans took this occasion to come forward and maliciously accuse the Jews.
Daniel,3,9,"They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “May the king live forever."
Daniel,3,10,"You as king have issued a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, drum, and every kind of music must fall down and worship the gold statue."
Daniel,3,11,Whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire.
Daniel,3,12,"There are some Jews you have appointed to manage the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men have ignored you, the king; they do not serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have set up.”"
Daniel,3,13,"Then in a furious rage Nebuchadnezzar gave orders to bring in Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. So these men were brought before the king."
Daniel,3,14,"Nebuchadnezzar asked them, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, is it true that you don’t serve my gods or worship the gold statue I have set up?"
Daniel,3,15,"Now if you’re ready, when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, drum, and every kind of music, fall down and worship the statue I made. But if you don’t worship it, you will immediately be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire—and who is the god who can rescue you from my power?”"
Daniel,3,16,"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied to the king, “Nebuchadnezzar, we don’t need to give you an answer to this question."
Daniel,3,17,"If the God we serve exists, then He can rescue us from the furnace of blazing fire, and He can rescue us from the power of you, the king."
Daniel,3,18,"But even if He does not rescue us, we want you as king to know that we will not serve your gods or worship the gold statue you set up.”"
Daniel,3,19,"Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with rage, and the expression on his face changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He gave orders to heat the furnace seven times more than was customary,"
Daniel,3,20,"and he commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and throw them into the furnace of blazing fire."
Daniel,3,21,"So these men, in their trousers, robes, head coverings, and other clothes, were tied up and thrown into the furnace of blazing fire."
Daniel,3,22,"Since the king’s command was so urgent and the furnace extremely hot, the raging flames killed those men who carried Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego up."
Daniel,3,23,"And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego fell, bound, into the furnace of blazing fire."
Daniel,3,24,"Then King Nebuchadnezzar jumped up in alarm. He said to his advisers, “Didn’t we throw three men, bound, into the fire?” “Yes, of course, Your Majesty,” they replied to the king."
Daniel,3,25,"He exclaimed, “Look! I see four men, not tied, walking around in the fire unharmed; and the fourth looks like a son of the gods.”"
Daniel,3,26,"Nebuchadnezzar then approached the door of the furnace of blazing fire and called: “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the Most High God—come out!” So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire."
Daniel,3,27,"When the satraps, prefects, governors, and the king’s advisers gathered around, they saw that the fire had no effect on the bodies of these men: not a hair of their heads was singed, their robes were unaffected, and there was no smell of fire on them."
Daniel,3,28,"Nebuchadnezzar exclaimed, “Praise to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego! He sent His angel and rescued His servants who trusted in Him. They violated the king’s command and risked their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God."
Daniel,3,29,"Therefore I issue a decree that anyone of any people, nation, or language who says anything offensive against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego will be torn limb from limb and his house made a garbage dump. For there is no other god who is able to deliver like this.”"
Daniel,3,30,"Then the king rewarded Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon."
Daniel,4,1,"King Nebuchadnezzar, To those of every people, nation, and language, who live in all the earth: May your prosperity increase."
Daniel,4,2,I am pleased to tell you about the miracles and wonders the Most High God has done for me.
Daniel,4,3,"How great are His miracles, and how mighty His wonders! His kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and His dominion is from generation to generation."
Daniel,4,4,"I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and flourishing in my palace."
Daniel,4,5,"I had a dream, and it frightened me; while in my bed, the images and visions in my mind alarmed me."
Daniel,4,6,So I issued a decree to bring all the wise men of Babylon to me in order that they might make the dream’s interpretation known to me.
Daniel,4,7,"When the diviner-priests, mediums, Chaldeans, and astrologers came in, I told them the dream, but they could not make its interpretation known to me."
Daniel,4,8,"Finally Daniel, named Belteshazzar after the name of my god—and the spirit of the holy gods is in him—came before me. I told him the dream:"
Daniel,4,9,"“Belteshazzar, head of the diviners, because I know that you have a spirit of the holy gods and that no mystery puzzles you, explain to me the visions of my dream that I saw, and its interpretation."
Daniel,4,10,"In the visions of my mind as I was lying in bed, I saw this: There was a tree in the middle of the earth, and its height was great."
Daniel,4,11,"The tree grew large and strong; its top reached to the sky, and it was visible to the ends of the earth."
Daniel,4,12,"Its leaves were beautiful, its fruit was abundant, and on it was food for all. Wild animals found shelter under it, the birds of the air lived in its branches, and every creature was fed from it."
Daniel,4,13,"“As I was lying in my bed, I also saw in the visions of my mind an observer, a holy one, coming down from heaven."
Daniel,4,14,"He called out loudly: Cut down the tree and chop off its branches; strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the animals flee from under it, and the birds from its branches."
Daniel,4,15,"But leave the stump with its roots in the ground, and with a band of iron and bronze around it, in the tender grass of the field. Let him be drenched with dew from the sky and share the plants of the earth with the animals."
Daniel,4,16,"Let his mind be changed from that of a man, and let him be given the mind of an animal for seven periods of time."
Daniel,4,17,This word is by decree of the observers; the matter is a command from the holy ones. This is so the living will know that the Most High is ruler over the kingdom of men. He gives it to anyone He wants and sets the lowliest of men over it.
Daniel,4,18,"This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had. Now, Belteshazzar, tell me the interpretation, because none of the wise men of my kingdom can make the interpretation known to me. But you can, because you have the spirit of the holy gods.”"
Daniel,4,19,"Then Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, was stunned for a moment, and his thoughts alarmed him. The king said, “Belteshazzar, don’t let the dream or its interpretation alarm you.” Belteshazzar answered, “My lord, may the dream apply to those who hate you, and its interpretation to your enemies!"
Daniel,4,20,"The tree you saw, which grew large and strong, whose top reached to the sky and was visible to all the earth,"
Daniel,4,21,"whose leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant—and on it was food for all, under it the wild animals lived, and in its branches the birds of the air lived—"
Daniel,4,22,"that tree is you, the king. For you have become great and strong: your greatness has grown and even reaches the sky, and your dominion extends to the ends of the earth."
Daniel,4,23,"“The king saw an observer, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, ‘Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump with its roots in the ground and with a band of iron and bronze around it, in the tender grass of the field. Let him be drenched with dew from the sky, and share food with the wild animals for seven periods of time.’"
Daniel,4,24,"This is the interpretation, Your Majesty, and this is the sentence of the Most High that has been passed against my lord the king:"
Daniel,4,25,"You will be driven away from people to live with the wild animals. You will feed on grass like cattle and be drenched with dew from the sky for seven periods of time, until you acknowledge that the Most High is ruler over the kingdom of men, and He gives it to anyone He wants."
Daniel,4,26,"As for the command to leave the tree’s stump with its roots, your kingdom will be restored to you as soon as you acknowledge that Heaven rules."
Daniel,4,27,"Therefore, may my advice seem good to you my king. Separate yourself from your sins by doing what is right, and from your injustices by showing mercy to the needy. Perhaps there will be an extension of your prosperity.”"
Daniel,4,28,All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.
Daniel,4,29,"At the end of 12 months, as he was walking on the roof of the royal palace in Babylon,"
Daniel,4,30,"the king exclaimed, “Is this not Babylon the Great that I have built by my vast power to be a royal residence and to display my majestic glory?”"
Daniel,4,31,"While the words were still in the king’s mouth, a voice came from heaven: “King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is declared that the kingdom has departed from you."
Daniel,4,32,"You will be driven away from people to live with the wild animals, and you will feed on grass like cattle for seven periods of time, until you acknowledge that the Most High is ruler over the kingdom of men, and He gives it to anyone He wants.”"
Daniel,4,33,"At that moment the sentence against Nebuchadnezzar was executed. He was driven away from people. He ate grass like cattle, and his body was drenched with dew from the sky, until his hair grew like eagles’ feathers and his nails like birds’ claws."
Daniel,4,34,"But at the end of those days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up to heaven, and my sanity returned to me. Then I praised the Most High and honored and glorified Him who lives forever: For His dominion is an everlasting dominion, and His kingdom is from generation to generation."
Daniel,4,35,"All the inhabitants of the earth are counted as nothing, and He does what He wants with the army of heaven and the inhabitants of the earth. There is no one who can hold back His hand or say to Him, “What have You done?”"
Daniel,4,36,"At that time my sanity returned to me, and my majesty and splendor returned to me for the glory of my kingdom. My advisers and my nobles sought me out, I was reestablished over my kingdom, and even more greatness came to me."
Daniel,4,37,"Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, exalt, and glorify the King of heaven, because all His works are true and His ways are just. He is able to humble those who walk in pride."
Daniel,5,1,"King Belshazzar held a great feast for 1,000 of his nobles and drank wine in their presence."
Daniel,5,2,"Under the influence of the wine, Belshazzar gave orders to bring in the gold and silver vessels that his predecessor Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, so that the king and his nobles, wives, and concubines could drink from them."
Daniel,5,3,"So they brought in the gold vessels that had been taken from the temple, the house of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his nobles, wives, and concubines drank from them."
Daniel,5,4,"They drank the wine and praised their gods made of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone."
Daniel,5,5,"At that moment the fingers of a man’s hand appeared and began writing on the plaster of the king’s palace wall next to the lampstand. As the king watched the hand that was writing,"
Daniel,5,6,"his face turned pale, and his thoughts so terrified him that his hip joints shook and his knees knocked together."
Daniel,5,7,"The king called out to bring in the mediums, Chaldeans, and astrologers. He said to these wise men of Babylon, “Whoever reads this inscription and gives me its interpretation will be clothed in purple, have a gold chain around his neck, and have the third highest position in the kingdom.”"
Daniel,5,8,"So all the king’s wise men came in, but none could read the inscription or make its interpretation known to him."
Daniel,5,9,"Then King Belshazzar became even more terrified, his face turned pale, and his nobles were bewildered."
Daniel,5,10,"Because of the outcry of the king and his nobles, the queen came to the banquet hall. “May the king live forever,” she said. “Don’t let your thoughts terrify you or your face be pale."
Daniel,5,11,"There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. In the days of your predecessor he was found to have insight, intelligence, and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods. Your predecessor, King Nebuchadnezzar, appointed him chief of the diviners, mediums, Chaldeans, and astrologers. Your own predecessor, the king,"
Daniel,5,12,"did this because Daniel, the one the king named Belteshazzar, was found to have an extraordinary spirit, knowledge and perception, and the ability to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve problems. Therefore, summon Daniel, and he will give the interpretation.”"
Daniel,5,13,"Then Daniel was brought before the king. The king said to him, “Are you Daniel, one of the Judean exiles that my predecessor the king brought from Judah?"
Daniel,5,14,"I’ve heard that you have the spirit of the gods in you, and that you have insight, intelligence, and extraordinary wisdom."
Daniel,5,15,"Now the wise men and mediums were brought before me to read this inscription and make its interpretation known to me, but they could not give its interpretation."
Daniel,5,16,"However, I have heard about you that you can give interpretations and solve problems. Therefore, if you can read this inscription and give me its interpretation, you will be clothed in purple, have a gold chain around your neck, and have the third highest position in the kingdom.”"
Daniel,5,17,"Then Daniel answered the king, “You may keep your gifts, and give your rewards to someone else; however, I will read the inscription for the king and make the interpretation known to him."
Daniel,5,18,"Your Majesty, the Most High God gave sovereignty, greatness, glory, and majesty to your predecessor Nebuchadnezzar."
Daniel,5,19,"Because of the greatness He gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages were terrified and fearful of him. He killed anyone he wanted and kept alive anyone he wanted; he exalted anyone he wanted and humbled anyone he wanted."
Daniel,5,20,"But when his heart was exalted and his spirit became arrogant, he was deposed from his royal throne and his glory was taken from him."
Daniel,5,21,"He was driven away from people, his mind was like an animal’s, he lived with the wild donkeys, he was fed grass like cattle, and his body was drenched with dew from the sky until he acknowledged that the Most High God is ruler over the kingdom of men and sets anyone He wants over it."
Daniel,5,22,"“But you his successor, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, even though you knew all this."
Daniel,5,23,"Instead, you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven. The vessels from His house were brought to you, and as you and your nobles, wives, and concubines drank wine from them, you praised the gods made of silver and gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see or hear or understand. But you have not glorified the God who holds your life-breath in His hand and who controls the whole course of your life."
Daniel,5,24,"Therefore, He sent the hand, and this writing was inscribed."
Daniel,5,25,"“This is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, PARSIN."
Daniel,5,26,This is the interpretation of the message: MENE means that God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end.
Daniel,5,27,TEKEL means that you have been weighed in the balance and found deficient.
Daniel,5,28,PERES means that your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and Persians.”
Daniel,5,29,"Then Belshazzar gave an order, and they clothed Daniel in purple, placed a gold chain around his neck, and issued a proclamation concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom."
Daniel,5,30,"That very night Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans was killed,"
Daniel,5,31,and Darius the Mede received the kingdom at the age of 62.
Daniel,6,1,"Darius decided to appoint 120 satraps over the kingdom, stationed throughout the realm,"
Daniel,6,2,"and over them three administrators, including Daniel. These satraps would be accountable to them so that the king would not be defrauded."
Daniel,6,3,"Daniel distinguished himself above the administrators and satraps because he had an extraordinary spirit, so the king planned to set him over the whole realm."
Daniel,6,4,"The administrators and satraps, therefore, kept trying to find a charge against Daniel regarding the kingdom. But they could find no charge or corruption, for he was trustworthy, and no negligence or corruption was found in him."
Daniel,6,5,"Then these men said, “We will never find any charge against this Daniel unless we find something against him concerning the law of his God.”"
Daniel,6,6,"So the administrators and satraps went together to the king and said to him, “May King Darius live forever."
Daniel,6,7,"All the administrators of the kingdom, the prefects, satraps, advisers, and governors have agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an edict that for 30 days, anyone who petitions any god or man except you, the king, will be thrown into the lions’ den."
Daniel,6,8,"Therefore, Your Majesty, establish the edict and sign the document so that, as a law of the Medes and Persians, it is irrevocable and cannot be changed.”"
Daniel,6,9,So King Darius signed the document.
Daniel,6,10,"When Daniel learned that the document had been signed, he went into his house. The windows in its upper room opened toward Jerusalem, and three times a day he got down on his knees, prayed, and gave thanks to his God, just as he had done before."
Daniel,6,11,Then these men went as a group and found Daniel petitioning and imploring his God.
Daniel,6,12,"So they approached the king and asked about his edict: “Didn’t you sign an edict that for 30 days any man who petitions any god or man except you, the king, will be thrown into the lions’ den?” The king answered, “As a law of the Medes and Persians, the order stands and is irrevocable.”"
Daniel,6,13,"Then they replied to the king, “Daniel, one of the Judean exiles, has ignored you, the king, and the edict you signed, for he prays three times a day.”"
Daniel,6,14,"As soon as the king heard this, he was very displeased; he set his mind on rescuing Daniel and made every effort until sundown to deliver him."
Daniel,6,15,"Then these men went to the king and said to him, “You as king know it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no edict or ordinance the king establishes can be changed.”"
Daniel,6,16,"So the king gave the order, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the lions’ den. The king said to Daniel, “May your God, whom you serve continually, rescue you!”"
Daniel,6,17,"A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den. The king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signet rings of his nobles, so that nothing in regard to Daniel could be changed."
Daniel,6,18,"Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting. No diversions were brought to him, and he could not sleep."
Daniel,6,19,At the first light of dawn the king got up and hurried to the lions’ den.
Daniel,6,20,"When he reached the den, he cried out in anguish to Daniel. “Daniel, servant of the living God,” the king said, “has your God whom you serve continually been able to rescue you from the lions?”"
Daniel,6,21,Then Daniel spoke with the king: “May the king live forever.
Daniel,6,22,"My God sent His angel and shut the lions’ mouths. They haven’t hurt me, for I was found innocent before Him. Also, I have not committed a crime against you my king.”"
Daniel,6,23,"The king was overjoyed and gave orders to take Daniel out of the den. So Daniel was taken out of the den, uninjured, for he trusted in his God."
Daniel,6,24,"The king then gave the command, and those men who had maliciously accused Daniel were brought and thrown into the lions’ den—they, their children, and their wives. They had not reached the bottom of the den before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones."
Daniel,6,25,"Then King Darius wrote to those of every people, nation, and language who live in all the earth: “May your prosperity abound."
Daniel,6,26,"I issue a decree that in all my royal dominion, people must tremble in fear before the God of Daniel: For He is the living God, and He endures forever; His kingdom will never be destroyed, and His dominion has no end."
Daniel,6,27,"He rescues and delivers; He performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth, for He has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions.”"
Daniel,6,28,So Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
Daniel,7,1,"In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream with visions in his mind as he was lying in his bed. He wrote down the dream, and here is the summary of his account."
Daniel,7,2,"Daniel said, “In my vision at night I was watching, and suddenly the four winds of heaven stirred up the great sea."
Daniel,7,3,"Four huge beasts came up from the sea, each different from the other."
Daniel,7,4,"“The first was like a lion but had eagle’s wings. I continued watching until its wings were torn off. It was lifted up from the ground, set on its feet like a man, and given a human mind."
Daniel,7,5,"“Suddenly, another beast appeared, a second one, that looked like a bear. It was raised up on one side, with three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, ‘Get up! Gorge yourself on flesh.’"
Daniel,7,6,"“While I was watching, another beast appeared. It was like a leopard with four wings of a bird on its back. It had four heads and was given authority to rule."
Daniel,7,7,"“While I was watching in the night visions, a fourth beast appeared, frightening and dreadful, and incredibly strong, with large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed, and it trampled with its feet whatever was left. It was different from all the beasts before it, and it had 10 horns."
Daniel,7,8,"“While I was considering the horns, suddenly another horn, a little one, came up among them, and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. There were eyes in this horn like a man’s, and it had a mouth that spoke arrogantly."
Daniel,7,9,"“As I kept watching, thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took His seat. His clothing was white like snow, and the hair of His head like whitest wool. His throne was flaming fire; its wheels were blazing fire."
Daniel,7,10,"A river of fire was flowing, coming out from His presence. Thousands upon thousands served Him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him. The court was convened, and the books were opened."
Daniel,7,11,"“I watched, then, because of the sound of the arrogant words the horn was speaking. As I continued watching, the beast was killed and its body destroyed and given over to the burning fire."
Daniel,7,12,"As for the rest of the beasts, their authority to rule was removed, but an extension of life was granted to them for a certain period of time."
Daniel,7,13,"I continued watching in the night visions, and I saw One like a son of man coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was escorted before Him."
Daniel,7,14,"He was given authority to rule, and glory, and a kingdom; so that those of every people, nation, and language should serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and His kingdom is one that will not be destroyed."
Daniel,7,15,"“As for me, Daniel, my spirit was deeply distressed within me, and the visions in my mind terrified me."
Daniel,7,16,I approached one of those who were standing by and asked him the true meaning of all this. So he let me know the interpretation of these things:
Daniel,7,17,"‘These huge beasts, four in number, are four kings who will rise from the earth."
Daniel,7,18,"But the holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom and possess it forever, yes, forever and ever.’"
Daniel,7,19,"“Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, the one different from all the others, extremely terrifying, with iron teeth and bronze claws, devouring, crushing, and trampling with its feet whatever was left."
Daniel,7,20,"I also wanted to know about the 10 horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three fell—the horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke arrogantly, and that was more visible than the others."
Daniel,7,21,"As I was watching, this horn waged war against the holy ones and was prevailing over them"
Daniel,7,22,"until the Ancient of Days arrived and a judgment was given in favor of the holy ones of the Most High, for the time had come, and the holy ones took possession of the kingdom."
Daniel,7,23,"“This is what he said: ‘The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on the earth, different from all the other kingdoms. It will devour the whole earth, trample it down, and crush it."
Daniel,7,24,"The 10 horns are 10 kings who will rise from this kingdom. Another, different from the previous ones, will rise after them and subdue three kings."
Daniel,7,25,"He will speak words against the Most High and oppress the holy ones of the Most High. He will intend to change religious festivals and laws, and the holy ones will be handed over to him for a time, times, and half a time."
Daniel,7,26,"But the court will convene, and his dominion will be taken away, to be completely destroyed forever."
Daniel,7,27,"The kingdom, dominion, and greatness of the kingdoms under all of heaven will be given to the people, the holy ones of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will serve and obey Him.’"
Daniel,7,28,"“This is the end of the interpretation. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts terrified me greatly, and my face turned pale, but I kept the matter to myself.”"
Daniel,8,1,"In the third year of King Belshazzar’s reign, a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after the one that had appeared to me earlier."
Daniel,8,2,"I saw the vision, and as I watched, I was in the fortress city of Susa, in the province of Elam. I saw in the vision that I was beside the Ulai Canal."
Daniel,8,3,"I looked up, and there was a ram standing beside the canal. He had two horns. The two horns were long, but one was longer than the other, and the longer one came up last."
Daniel,8,4,"I saw the ram charging to the west, the north, and the south. No animal could stand against him, and there was no rescue from his power. He did whatever he wanted and became great."
Daniel,8,5,"As I was observing, a male goat appeared, coming from the west across the surface of the entire earth without touching the ground. The goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes."
Daniel,8,6,He came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and rushed at him with savage fury.
Daniel,8,7,"I saw him approaching the ram, and infuriated with him, he struck the ram, shattering his two horns, and the ram was not strong enough to stand against him. The goat threw him to the ground and trampled him, and there was no one to rescue the ram from his power."
Daniel,8,8,"Then the male goat became very great, but when he became powerful, the large horn was shattered. Four conspicuous horns came up in its place, pointing toward the four winds of heaven."
Daniel,8,9,From one of them a little horn emerged and grew extensively toward the south and the east and toward the beautiful land.
Daniel,8,10,"It grew as high as the heavenly host, made some of the stars and some of the host fall to the earth, and trampled them."
Daniel,8,11,"It made itself great, even up to the Prince of the host; it removed His daily sacrifice and overthrew the place of His sanctuary."
Daniel,8,12,"Because of rebellion, a host, together with the daily sacrifice, will be given over. The horn will throw truth to the ground and will be successful in whatever it does."
Daniel,8,13,"Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to the speaker, “How long will the events of this vision last—the daily sacrifice, the rebellion that makes desolate, and the giving over of the sanctuary and of the host to be trampled?”"
Daniel,8,14,"He said to me, “For 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be restored.”"
Daniel,8,15,"While I, Daniel, was watching the vision and trying to understand it, there stood before me someone who appeared to be a man."
Daniel,8,16,"I heard a human voice calling from the middle of the Ulai: “Gabriel, explain the vision to this man.”"
Daniel,8,17,"So he approached where I was standing; when he came near, I was terrified and fell facedown. “Son of man,” he said to me, “understand that the vision refers to the time of the end.”"
Daniel,8,18,"While he was speaking to me, I fell into a deep sleep, with my face to the ground. Then he touched me, made me stand up,"
Daniel,8,19,"and said, “I am here to tell you what will happen at the conclusion of the time of wrath, because it refers to the appointed time of the end."
Daniel,8,20,The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia.
Daniel,8,21,"The shaggy goat represents the king of Greece, and the large horn between his eyes represents the first king."
Daniel,8,22,"The four horns that took the place of the shattered horn represent four kingdoms. They will rise from that nation, but without its power."
Daniel,8,23,"Near the end of their kingdoms, when the rebels have reached the full measure of their sin, an insolent king, skilled in intrigue, will come to the throne."
Daniel,8,24,"His power will be great, but it will not be his own. He will cause terrible destruction and succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy the powerful along with the holy people."
Daniel,8,25,"He will cause deceit to prosper through his cunning and by his influence, and in his own mind he will make himself great. He will destroy many in a time of peace; he will even stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be shattered—not by human hands."
Daniel,8,26,The vision of the evenings and the mornings that has been told is true. Now you must seal up the vision because it refers to many days in the future.”
Daniel,8,27,"I, Daniel, was overcome and lay sick for days. Then I got up and went about the king’s business. I was greatly disturbed by the vision and could not understand it."
Daniel,9,1,"In the first year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus, a Mede by birth, who was ruler over the kingdom of the Chaldeans:"
Daniel,9,2,"In the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood from the books according to the word of the LORD to Jeremiah the prophet that the number of years for the desolation of Jerusalem would be 70."
Daniel,9,3,"So I turned my attention to the Lord God to seek Him by prayer and petitions, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes."
Daniel,9,4,"I prayed to the LORD my God and confessed: Ah, Lord—the great and awe-inspiring God who keeps His gracious covenant with those who love Him and keep His commands—"
Daniel,9,5,"we have sinned, done wrong, acted wickedly, rebelled, and turned away from Your commands and ordinances."
Daniel,9,6,"We have not listened to Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings, leaders, fathers, and all the people of the land."
Daniel,9,7,"Lord, righteousness belongs to You, but this day public shame belongs to us: the men of Judah, the residents of Jerusalem, and all Israel—those who are near and those who are far, in all the countries where You have dispersed them because of the disloyalty they have shown toward You."
Daniel,9,8,"LORD, public shame belongs to us, our kings, our leaders, and our fathers, because we have sinned against You."
Daniel,9,9,"Compassion and forgiveness belong to the Lord our God, though we have rebelled against Him"
Daniel,9,10,and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God by following His instructions that He set before us through His servants the prophets.
Daniel,9,11,"All Israel has broken Your law and turned away, refusing to obey You. The promised curse written in the law of Moses, the servant of God, has been poured out on us because we have sinned against Him."
Daniel,9,12,He has carried out His words that He spoke against us and against our rulers by bringing on us so great a disaster that nothing like what has been done to Jerusalem has ever been done under all of heaven.
Daniel,9,13,"Just as it is written in the law of Moses, all this disaster has come on us, yet we have not appeased the LORD our God by turning from our iniquities and paying attention to Your truth."
Daniel,9,14,"So the LORD kept the disaster in mind and brought it on us, for the LORD our God is righteous in all He has done. But we have not obeyed Him."
Daniel,9,15,"Now, Lord our God, who brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and made Your name renowned as it is this day, we have sinned, we have acted wickedly."
Daniel,9,16,"Lord, in keeping with all Your righteous acts, may Your anger and wrath turn away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain; for because of our sins and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people have become an object of ridicule to all those around us."
Daniel,9,17,"Therefore, our God, hear the prayer and the petitions of Your servant. Show Your favor to Your desolate sanctuary for the Lord’s sake."
Daniel,9,18,"Listen, my God, and hear. Open Your eyes and see our desolations and the city called by Your name. For we are not presenting our petitions before You based on our righteous acts, but based on Your abundant compassion."
Daniel,9,19,"Lord, hear! Lord, forgive! Lord, listen and act! My God, for Your own sake, do not delay, because Your city and Your people are called by Your name."
Daniel,9,20,"While I was speaking, praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my petition before Yahweh my God concerning the holy mountain of my God—"
Daniel,9,21,"while I was praying, Gabriel, the man I had seen in the first vision, came to me in my extreme weariness, about the time of the evening offering."
Daniel,9,22,"He gave me this explanation: “Daniel, I’ve come now to give you understanding."
Daniel,9,23,"At the beginning of your petitions an answer went out, and I have come to give it, for you are treasured by God. So consider the message and understand the vision:"
Daniel,9,24,"Seventy weeks are decreed about your people and your holy city— to bring the rebellion to an end, to put a stop to sin, to wipe away iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy place."
Daniel,9,25,"Know and understand this: From the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Prince will be seven weeks and 62 weeks. It will be rebuilt with a plaza and a moat, but in difficult times."
Daniel,9,26,"After those 62 weeks the Messiah will be cut off and will have nothing. The people of the coming prince will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come with a flood, and until the end there will be war; desolations are decreed."
Daniel,9,27,"He will make a firm covenant with many for one week, but in the middle of the week he will put a stop to sacrifice and offering. And the abomination of desolation will be on a wing of the temple until the decreed destruction is poured out on the desolator.”"
Daniel,10,1,"In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a message was revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshazzar. The message was true and was about a great conflict. He understood the message and had understanding of the vision."
Daniel,10,2,"In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three full weeks."
Daniel,10,3,"I didn’t eat any rich food, no meat or wine entered my mouth, and I didn’t put any oil on my body until the three weeks were over."
Daniel,10,4,"On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river, the Tigris,"
Daniel,10,5,"I looked up, and there was a man dressed in linen, with a belt of gold from Uphaz around his waist."
Daniel,10,6,"His body was like topaz, his face like the brilliance of lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and feet like the gleam of polished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude."
Daniel,10,7,"Only I, Daniel, saw the vision. The men who were with me did not see it, but a great terror fell on them, and they ran and hid."
Daniel,10,8,"I was left alone, looking at this great vision. No strength was left in me; my face grew deathly pale, and I was powerless."
Daniel,10,9,"I heard the words he said, and when I heard them I fell into a deep sleep, with my face to the ground."
Daniel,10,10,"Suddenly, a hand touched me and raised me to my hands and knees."
Daniel,10,11,"He said to me, “Daniel, you are a man treasured by God. Understand the words that I’m saying to you. Stand on your feet, for I have now been sent to you.” After he said this to me, I stood trembling."
Daniel,10,12,"“Don’t be afraid, Daniel,” he said to me, “for from the first day that you purposed to understand and to humble yourself before your God, your prayers were heard. I have come because of your prayers."
Daniel,10,13,"But the prince of the kingdom of Persia opposed me for 21 days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me after I had been left there with the kings of Persia."
Daniel,10,14,"Now I have come to help you understand what will happen to your people in the last days, for the vision refers to those days.”"
Daniel,10,15,"While he was saying these words to me, I turned my face toward the ground and was speechless."
Daniel,10,16,"Suddenly one with human likeness touched my lips. I opened my mouth and said to the one standing in front of me, “My lord, because of the vision, anguish overwhelms me and I am powerless."
Daniel,10,17,"How can someone like me, your servant, speak with someone like you, my lord? Now I have no strength, and there is no breath in me.”"
Daniel,10,18,Then the one with human likeness touched me again and strengthened me.
Daniel,10,19,"He said, “Don’t be afraid, you who are treasured by God. Peace to you; be very strong!” As he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, “Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.”"
Daniel,10,20,"He said, “Do you know why I’ve come to you? I must return at once to fight against the prince of Persia, and when I leave, the prince of Greece will come."
Daniel,10,21,"No one has the courage to support me against them except Michael, your prince. However, I will tell you what is recorded in the book of truth."
Daniel,11,1,"In the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to strengthen and protect him."
Daniel,11,2,"“Three more kings will arise in Persia, and the fourth will be far richer than the others. By the power he gains through his riches, he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece."
Daniel,11,3,Then a warrior king will arise; he will rule a vast realm and do whatever he wants.
Daniel,11,4,"But as soon as he is established, his kingdom will be broken up and divided to the four winds of heaven, but not to his descendants; it will not be the same kingdom that he ruled, because his kingdom will be uprooted and will go to others besides them."
Daniel,11,5,"“The king of the South will grow powerful, but one of his commanders will grow more powerful and will rule a kingdom greater than his."
Daniel,11,6,"After some years they will form an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the South will go to the king of the North to seal the agreement. She will not retain power, and his strength will not endure. She will be given up, together with her entourage, her father, and the one who supported her during those times."
Daniel,11,7,"In the place of the king of the South, one from her family will rise up, come against the army, and enter the fortress of the king of the North. He will take action against them and triumph."
Daniel,11,8,"He will take even their gods captive to Egypt, with their metal images and their precious articles of silver and gold. For some years he will stay away from the king of the North,"
Daniel,11,9,who will enter the kingdom of the king of the South and then return to his own land.
Daniel,11,10,"“His sons will mobilize for war and assemble a large number of armed forces. They will advance, sweeping through like a flood, and will again wage war as far as his fortress."
Daniel,11,11,"Infuriated, the king of the South will march out to fight with the king of the North who will raise a large army but they will be handed over to his enemy."
Daniel,11,12,"When the army is carried off, he will become arrogant and cause tens of thousands to fall, but he will not triumph."
Daniel,11,13,The king of the North will again raise a multitude larger than the first. After some years he will advance with a great army and many supplies.
Daniel,11,14,"“In those times many will rise up against the king of the South. Violent ones among your own people will assert themselves to fulfill a vision, but they will fail."
Daniel,11,15,"Then the king of the North will come, build up an assault ramp, and capture a well-fortified city. The forces of the South will not stand; even their select troops will not be able to resist."
Daniel,11,16,"The king of the North who comes against him will do whatever he wants, and no one can oppose him. He will establish himself in the beautiful land with total destruction in his hand."
Daniel,11,17,"He will resolve to come with the force of his whole kingdom and will reach an agreement with him. He will give him a daughter in marriage to destroy it, but she will not stand with him or support him."
Daniel,11,18,"Then he will turn his attention to the coasts and islands and capture many. But a commander will put an end to his taunting; instead, he will turn his taunts against him."
Daniel,11,19,"He will turn his attention back to the fortresses of his own land, but he will stumble, fall, and be no more."
Daniel,11,20,"“In his place one will arise who will send out a tax collector for the glory of the kingdom; but within a few days he will be shattered, though not in anger or in battle."
Daniel,11,21,"“In his place a despised person will arise; royal honors will not be given to him, but he will come during a time of peace and seize the kingdom by intrigue."
Daniel,11,22,"A flood of forces will be swept away before him; they will be shattered, as well as the covenant prince."
Daniel,11,23,"After an alliance is made with him, he will act deceitfully. He will rise to power with a small nation."
Daniel,11,24,"During a time of peace, he will come into the richest parts of the province and do what his fathers and predecessors never did. He will lavish plunder, loot, and wealth on his followers, and he will make plans against fortified cities, but only for a time."
Daniel,11,25,"“With a large army he will stir up his power and his courage against the king of the South. The king of the South will prepare for battle with an extremely large and powerful army, but he will not succeed, because plots will be made against him."
Daniel,11,26,"Those who eat his provisions will destroy him; his army will be swept away, and many will fall slain."
Daniel,11,27,"The two kings, whose hearts are bent on evil, will speak lies at the same table but to no avail, for still the end will come at the appointed time."
Daniel,11,28,"The king of the North will return to his land with great wealth, but his heart will be set against the holy covenant; he will take action, then return to his own land."
Daniel,11,29,"“At the appointed time he will come again to the South, but this time will not be like the first."
Daniel,11,30,"Ships of Kittim will come against him, and being intimidated, he will withdraw. Then he will rage against the holy covenant and take action. On his return, he will favor those who abandon the holy covenant."
Daniel,11,31,His forces will rise up and desecrate the temple fortress. They will abolish the daily sacrifice and set up the abomination of desolation.
Daniel,11,32,"With flattery he will corrupt those who act wickedly toward the covenant, but the people who know their God will be strong and take action."
Daniel,11,33,"Those who are wise among the people will give understanding to many, yet they will die by sword and flame, and be captured and plundered for a time."
Daniel,11,34,"When defeated, they will be helped by some, but many others will join them insincerely."
Daniel,11,35,"Some of the wise will fall so that they may be refined, purified, and cleansed until the time of the end, for it will still come at the appointed time."
Daniel,11,36,"“Then the king will do whatever he wants. He will exalt and magnify himself above every god, and he will say outrageous things against the God of gods. He will be successful until the time of wrath is completed, because what has been decreed will be accomplished."
Daniel,11,37,"He will not show regard for the gods of his fathers, the god longed for by women, or for any other god, because he will magnify himself above all."
Daniel,11,38,"Instead, he will honor a god of fortresses—a god his fathers did not know—with gold, silver, precious stones, and riches."
Daniel,11,39,"He will deal with the strongest fortresses with the help of a foreign god. He will greatly honor those who acknowledge him, making them rulers over many and distributing land as a reward."
Daniel,11,40,"“At the time of the end, the king of the South will engage him in battle, but the king of the North will storm against him with chariots, horsemen, and many ships. He will invade countries and sweep through them like a flood."
Daniel,11,41,"He will also invade the beautiful land, and many will fall. But these will escape from his power: Edom, Moab, and the prominent people of the Ammonites."
Daniel,11,42,"He will extend his power against the countries, and not even the land of Egypt will escape."
Daniel,11,43,He will get control over the hidden treasures of gold and silver and over all the riches of Egypt. The Libyans and Cushites will also be in submission.
Daniel,11,44,"But reports from the east and the north will terrify him, and he will go out with great fury to annihilate and completely destroy many."
Daniel,11,45,"He will pitch his royal tents between the sea and the beautiful holy mountain, but he will meet his end with no one to help him."
Daniel,12,1,At that time Michael the great prince who stands watch over your people will rise up. There will be a time of distress such as never has occurred since nations came into being until that time. But at that time all your people who are found written in the book will escape.
Daniel,12,2,"Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to eternal life, and some to shame and eternal contempt."
Daniel,12,3,"Those who are wise will shine like the bright expanse of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever."
Daniel,12,4,"“But you, Daniel, keep these words secret and seal the book until the time of the end. Many will roam about, and knowledge will increase.”"
Daniel,12,5,"Then I, Daniel, looked, and two others were standing there, one on this bank of the river and one on the other."
Daniel,12,6,"One of them said to the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, “How long until the end of these extraordinary things?”"
Daniel,12,7,"Then I heard the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river. He raised both his hands toward heaven and swore by Him who lives eternally that it would be for a time, times, and half a time. When the power of the holy people is shattered, all these things will be completed."
Daniel,12,8,"I heard but did not understand. So I asked, “My lord, what will be the outcome of these things?”"
Daniel,12,9,"He said, “Go on your way, Daniel, for the words are secret and sealed until the time of the end."
Daniel,12,10,"Many will be purified, cleansed, and refined, but the wicked will act wickedly; none of the wicked will understand, but the wise will understand."
Daniel,12,11,"From the time the daily sacrifice is abolished and the abomination of desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days."
Daniel,12,12,"The one who waits for and reaches 1,335 days is blessed."
Daniel,12,13,"But as for you, go on your way to the end; you will rest, then rise to your destiny at the end of the days.”"
Hosea,1,1,"The word of the LORD that came to Hosea son of Beeri during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and of Jeroboam son of Jehoash, king of Israel."
Hosea,1,2,"When the LORD first spoke to Hosea, He said this to him: Go and marry a promiscuous wife and have children of promiscuity, for the land is committing blatant acts of promiscuity by abandoning the LORD."
Hosea,1,3,"So he went and married Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son."
Hosea,1,4,"Then the LORD said to him: Name him Jezreel, for in a little while I will bring the bloodshed of Jezreel on the house of Jehu and put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel."
Hosea,1,5,On that day I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel.
Hosea,1,6,"She conceived again and gave birth to a daughter, and the LORD said to him: Name her No Compassion, for I will no longer have compassion on the house of Israel. I will certainly take them away."
Hosea,1,7,"But I will have compassion on the house of Judah, and I will deliver them by the LORD their God. I will not deliver them by bow, sword, or war, or by horses and cavalry."
Hosea,1,8,"After Gomer had weaned No Compassion, she conceived and gave birth to a son."
Hosea,1,9,"Then the LORD said: Name him Not My People, for you are not My people, and I will not be your God."
Hosea,1,10,"Yet the number of the Israelites will be like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or counted. And in the place where they were told: You are not My people, they will be called: Sons of the living God."
Hosea,1,11,And the Judeans and the Israelites will be gathered together. They will appoint for themselves a single ruler and go up from the land. For the day of Jezreel will be great.
Hosea,2,1,Call your brothers: My People and your sisters: Compassion.
Hosea,2,2,Rebuke your mother; rebuke her. For she is not My wife and I am not her husband. Let her remove the promiscuous look from her face and her adultery from between her breasts.
Hosea,2,3,"Otherwise, I will strip her naked and expose her as she was on the day of her birth. I will make her like a desert and like a parched land, and I will let her die of thirst."
Hosea,2,4,I will have no compassion on her children because they are the children of promiscuity.
Hosea,2,5,"Yes, their mother is promiscuous; she conceived them and acted shamefully. For she thought, “I will go after my lovers, the men who give me my food and water, my wool and flax, my oil and drink.”"
Hosea,2,6,"Therefore, this is what I will do: I will block her way with thorns; I will enclose her with a wall, so that she cannot find her paths."
Hosea,2,7,"She will pursue her lovers but not catch them; she will seek them but not find them. Then she will think, “I will go back to my former husband, for then it was better for me than now.”"
Hosea,2,8,"She does not recognize that it is I who gave her the grain, the new wine, and the oil. I lavished silver and gold on her, which they used for Baal."
Hosea,2,9,"Therefore, I will take back My grain in its time and My new wine in its season; I will take away My wool and linen, which were to cover her nakedness."
Hosea,2,10,"Now I will expose her shame in the sight of her lovers, and no one will rescue her from My hands."
Hosea,2,11,"I will put an end to all her celebrations: her feasts, New Moons, and Sabbaths— all her festivals."
Hosea,2,12,"I will devastate her vines and fig trees. She thinks that these are her wages that her lovers have given her. I will turn them into a thicket, and the wild animals will eat them."
Hosea,2,13,"And I will punish her for the days of the Baals when she burned incense to them, put on her rings and jewelry, and went after her lovers, but forgot Me. This is the LORD’s declaration."
Hosea,2,14,"Therefore, I am going to persuade her, lead her to the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her."
Hosea,2,15,"There I will give her vineyards back to her and make the Valley of Achor into a gateway of hope. There she will respond as she did in the days of her youth, as in the day she came out of the land of Egypt."
Hosea,2,16,"In that day— this is the LORD’s declaration— you will call Me, “My husband,” and no longer call Me, “My Baal.”"
Hosea,2,17,For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth; they will no longer be remembered by their names.
Hosea,2,18,"On that day I will make a covenant for them with the wild animals, the birds of the sky, and the creatures that crawl on the ground. I will shatter bow, sword, and weapons of war in the land and will enable the people to rest securely."
Hosea,2,19,"I will take you to be My wife forever. I will take you to be My wife in righteousness, justice, love, and compassion."
Hosea,2,20,"I will take you to be My wife in faithfulness, and you will know Yahweh."
Hosea,2,21,"On that day I will respond— this is the LORD’s declaration. I will respond to the sky, and it will respond to the earth."
Hosea,2,22,"The earth will respond to the grain, the new wine, and the oil, and they will respond to Jezreel."
Hosea,2,23,"I will sow her in the land for Myself, and I will have compassion on No Compassion; I will say to Not My People: You are My people, and he will say, “You are My God.”"
Hosea,3,1,"Then the LORD said to me, “Go again; show love to a woman who is loved by another man and is an adulteress, just as the LORD loves the Israelites though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes.”"
Hosea,3,2,So I bought her for 15 shekels of silver and five bushels of barley.
Hosea,3,3,"I said to her, “You must live with me many days. Don’t be promiscuous or belong to any man, and I will act the same way toward you.”"
Hosea,3,4,"For the Israelites must live many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred pillar, and without ephod or household idols."
Hosea,3,5,"Afterward, the people of Israel will return and seek the LORD their God and David their king. They will come with awe to the LORD and to His goodness in the last days."
Hosea,4,1,"Hear the word of the LORD, people of Israel, for the LORD has a case against the inhabitants of the land: There is no truth, no faithful love, and no knowledge of God in the land!"
Hosea,4,2,"Cursing, lying, murder, stealing, and adultery are rampant; one act of bloodshed follows another."
Hosea,4,3,"For this reason the land mourns, and everyone who lives in it languishes, along with the wild animals and the birds of the sky; even the fish of the sea disappear."
Hosea,4,4,"But let no one dispute; let no one argue, for My case is against you priests."
Hosea,4,5,You will stumble by day; the prophet will also stumble with you by night. And I will destroy your mother.
Hosea,4,6,"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I will reject you from serving as My priest. Since you have forgotten the law of your God, I will also forget your sons."
Hosea,4,7,"The more they multiplied, the more they sinned against Me. I will change their honor into disgrace."
Hosea,4,8,They feed on the sin of My people; they have an appetite for their transgressions.
Hosea,4,9,The same judgment will happen to both people and priests. I will punish them for their ways and repay them for their deeds.
Hosea,4,10,They will eat but not be satisfied; they will be promiscuous but not multiply. For they have abandoned their devotion to the LORD.
Hosea,4,11,"Promiscuity, wine, and new wine take away one’s understanding."
Hosea,4,12,"My people consult their wooden idols, and their divining rods inform them. For a spirit of promiscuity leads them astray; they act promiscuously in disobedience to their God."
Hosea,4,13,"They sacrifice on the mountaintops, and they burn offerings on the hills, and under oaks, poplars, and terebinths, because their shade is pleasant. And so your daughters act promiscuously and your daughters-in-law commit adultery."
Hosea,4,14,"I will not punish your daughters when they act promiscuously or your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery, for the men themselves go off with prostitutes and make sacrifices with cult prostitutes. People without discernment are doomed."
Hosea,4,15,"Israel, if you act promiscuously, don’t let Judah become guilty! Do not go to Gilgal or make a pilgrimage to Beth-aven, and do not swear an oath: As the LORD lives!"
Hosea,4,16,For Israel is as obstinate as a stubborn cow. Can the LORD now shepherd them like a lamb in an open meadow?
Hosea,4,17,Ephraim is attached to idols; leave him alone!
Hosea,4,18,"When their drinking is over, they turn to promiscuity. Israel’s leaders fervently love disgrace."
Hosea,4,19,"A wind with its wings will carry them off, and they will be ashamed of their sacrifices."
Hosea,5,1,"Hear this, priests! Pay attention, house of Israel! Listen, royal house! For the judgment applies to you because you have been a snare at Mizpah and a net spread out on Tabor."
Hosea,5,2,Rebels are deeply involved in slaughter; I will be a punishment for all of them.
Hosea,5,3,"I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from Me. For now, Ephraim, you have acted promiscuously; Israel is defiled."
Hosea,5,4,"Their actions do not allow them to return to their God, for a spirit of promiscuity is among them, and they do not know the LORD."
Hosea,5,5,Israel’s arrogance testifies against them. Both Israel and Ephraim stumble because of their wickedness; even Judah will stumble with them.
Hosea,5,6,They go with their flocks and herds to seek the LORD but do not find Him; He has withdrawn from them.
Hosea,5,7,"They betrayed the LORD; indeed, they gave birth to illegitimate children. Now the New Moon will devour them along with their fields."
Hosea,5,8,"Blow the horn in Gibeah, the trumpet in Ramah; raise the war cry in Beth-aven: After you, Benjamin!"
Hosea,5,9,Ephraim will become a desolation on the day of punishment; I announce what is certain among the tribes of Israel.
Hosea,5,10,The princes of Judah are like those who move boundary markers; I will pour out My fury on them like water.
Hosea,5,11,"Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment, for he is determined to follow what is worthless."
Hosea,5,12,So I am like rot to Ephraim and like decay to the house of Judah.
Hosea,5,13,"When Ephraim saw his sickness and Judah his wound, Ephraim went to Assyria and sent a delegation to the great king. But he cannot cure you or heal your wound."
Hosea,5,14,"For I am like a lion to Ephraim and like a young lion to the house of Judah. Yes, I will tear them to pieces and depart. I will carry them off, and no one can rescue them."
Hosea,5,15,I will depart and return to My place until they recognize their guilt and seek My face; they will search for Me in their distress.
Hosea,6,1,"Come, let us return to the LORD. For He has torn us, and He will heal us; He has wounded us, and He will bind up our wounds."
Hosea,6,2,"He will revive us after two days, and on the third day He will raise us up so we can live in His presence."
Hosea,6,3,"Let us strive to know the LORD. His appearance is as sure as the dawn. He will come to us like the rain, like the spring showers that water the land."
Hosea,6,4,"What am I going to do with you, Ephraim? What am I going to do with you, Judah? Your loyalty is like the morning mist and like the early dew that vanishes."
Hosea,6,5,This is why I have used the prophets to cut them down; I have killed them with the words of My mouth. My judgment strikes like lightning.
Hosea,6,6,"For I desire loyalty and not sacrifice, the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings."
Hosea,6,7,"But they, like Adam, have violated the covenant; there they have betrayed Me."
Hosea,6,8,"Gilead is a city of evildoers, tracked with bloody footprints."
Hosea,6,9,"Like raiders who wait in ambush for someone, a band of priests murders on the road to Shechem. They commit atrocities."
Hosea,6,10,I have seen something horrible in the house of Israel: Ephraim’s promiscuity is there; Israel is defiled.
Hosea,6,11,"A harvest is also appointed for you, Judah. When I return My people from captivity,"
Hosea,7,1,"when I heal Israel, the sins of Ephraim and the crimes of Samaria will be exposed. For they practice fraud; a thief breaks in; a raiding party pillages outside."
Hosea,7,2,But they never consider that I remember all their evil. Now their sins are all around them; they are right in front of My face.
Hosea,7,3,"They please the king with their evil, the princes with their lies."
Hosea,7,4,All of them commit adultery; they are like an oven heated by a baker who stops stirring the fire from the kneading of the dough until it is leavened.
Hosea,7,5,"On the day of our king, the princes are sick with the heat of wine— there is a conspiracy with traitors."
Hosea,7,6,For they—their hearts like an oven— draw him into their oven. Their anger smolders all night; in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.
Hosea,7,7,"All of them are as hot as an oven, and they consume their rulers. All their kings fall; not one of them calls on Me."
Hosea,7,8,Ephraim has allowed himself to get mixed up with the nations. Ephraim is unturned bread baked on a griddle.
Hosea,7,9,"Foreigners consume his strength, but he does not notice. Even his hair is streaked with gray, but he does not notice."
Hosea,7,10,"Israel’s arrogance testifies against them, yet they do not return to Yahweh their God, and for all this, they do not seek Him."
Hosea,7,11,"So Ephraim has become like a silly, senseless dove; they call to Egypt, and they go to Assyria."
Hosea,7,12,"As they are going, I will spread My net over them; I will bring them down like birds of the sky. I will discipline them in accordance with the news that reaches their assembly."
Hosea,7,13,"Woe to them, for they fled from Me; destruction to them, for they rebelled against Me! Though I want to redeem them, they speak lies against Me."
Hosea,7,14,"They do not cry to Me from their hearts; rather, they wail on their beds. They slash themselves for grain and new wine; they turn away from Me."
Hosea,7,15,"I trained and strengthened their arms, but they plot evil against Me."
Hosea,7,16,"They turn, but not to what is above; they are like a faulty bow. Their leaders will fall by the sword because of the cursing of their tongue. They will be ridiculed for this in the land of Egypt."
Hosea,8,1,"Put the horn to your mouth! One like an eagle comes against the house of the LORD, because they transgress My covenant and rebel against My law."
Hosea,8,2,"Israel cries out to Me, “My God, we know You!”"
Hosea,8,3,Israel has rejected what is good; an enemy will pursue him.
Hosea,8,4,"They have installed kings, but not through Me. They have appointed leaders, but without My approval. They make their silver and gold into idols for themselves for their own destruction."
Hosea,8,5,"Your calf-idol is rejected, Samaria. My anger burns against them. How long will they be incapable of innocence?"
Hosea,8,6,"For this thing is from Israel— a craftsman made it, and it is not God. The calf of Samaria will be smashed to bits!"
Hosea,8,7,"Indeed, they sow the wind and reap the whirlwind. There is no standing grain; what sprouts fails to yield flour. Even if they did, foreigners would swallow it up."
Hosea,8,8,Israel is swallowed up! Now they are among the nations like discarded pottery.
Hosea,8,9,For they have gone up to Assyria like a wild donkey going off on its own. Ephraim has paid for love.
Hosea,8,10,"Even though they hire lovers among the nations, I will now round them up, and they will begin to decrease in number under the burden of the king and leaders."
Hosea,8,11,"When Ephraim multiplied his altars for sin, they became his altars for sinning."
Hosea,8,12,"Though I were to write out for him ten thousand points of My instruction, they would be regarded as something strange."
Hosea,8,13,"Though they offer sacrificial gifts and eat the flesh, the LORD does not accept them. Now He will remember their guilt and punish their sins; they will return to Egypt."
Hosea,8,14,"Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces; Judah has also multiplied fortified cities. I will send fire on their cities, and it will consume their citadels."
Hosea,9,1,"Israel, do not rejoice jubilantly as the nations do, for you have acted promiscuously, leaving your God. You have loved the wages of a prostitute on every grain-threshing floor."
Hosea,9,2,"Threshing floor and wine vat will not sustain them, and the new wine will fail them."
Hosea,9,3,"They will not stay in the land of the LORD. Instead, Ephraim will return to Egypt, and they will eat unclean food in Assyria."
Hosea,9,4,"They will not pour out their wine offerings to the LORD, and their sacrifices will not please Him. Their food will be like the bread of mourners; all who eat it become defiled. For their bread will be for their appetites alone; it will not enter the house of the LORD."
Hosea,9,5,"What will you do on a festival day, on the day of the LORD’s feast?"
Hosea,9,6,"For even if they flee from devastation, Egypt will gather them, and Memphis will bury them. Thistles will take possession of their precious silver; thorns will invade their tents."
Hosea,9,7,"The days of punishment have come; the days of retribution have come. Let Israel recognize it! The prophet is a fool, and the inspired man is insane, because of the magnitude of your guilt and hostility."
Hosea,9,8,Ephraim’s watchman is with my God. The prophet encounters a fowler’s snare on all his ways. Hostility is in the house of his God!
Hosea,9,9,They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their guilt; He will punish their sins.
Hosea,9,10,"I discovered Israel like grapes in the wilderness. I saw your fathers like the first fruit of the fig tree in its first season. But they went to Baal-peor, consecrated themselves to Shame, and became detestable, like the thing they loved."
Hosea,9,11,"Ephraim’s glory will fly away like a bird: no birth, no gestation, no conception."
Hosea,9,12,"Even if they raise children, I will bereave them of each one. Yes, woe to them when I depart from them!"
Hosea,9,13,"I have seen Ephraim like Tyre, planted in a meadow, so Ephraim will bring out his children to the executioner."
Hosea,9,14,"Give them, LORD— What should You give? Give them a womb that miscarries and breasts that are dry!"
Hosea,9,15,"All their evil appears at Gilgal, for there I came to hate them. I will drive them from My house because of their evil, wicked actions. I will no longer love them; all their leaders are rebellious."
Hosea,9,16,"Ephraim is struck down; their roots are withered; they cannot bear fruit. Even if they bear children, I will kill the precious offspring of their wombs."
Hosea,9,17,My God will reject them because they have not listened to Him; they will become wanderers among the nations.
Hosea,10,1,"Israel is a lush vine; it yields fruit for itself. The more his fruit increased, the more he increased the altars. The better his land produced, the better they made the sacred pillars."
Hosea,10,2,Their hearts are devious; now they must bear their guilt. The LORD will break down their altars and demolish their sacred pillars.
Hosea,10,3,"In fact, they are now saying, “We have no king! For we do not fear the LORD. What can a king do for us?”"
Hosea,10,4,"They speak mere words, taking false oaths while making covenants. So lawsuits break out like poisonous weeds in the furrows of a field."
Hosea,10,5,"The residents of Samaria will have anxiety over the calf of Beth-aven. Indeed, its idolatrous priests rejoiced over it; the people will mourn over it, over its glory. It will certainly depart from them."
Hosea,10,6,The calf itself will be taken to Assyria as an offering to the great king. Ephraim will experience shame; Israel will be ashamed of its counsel.
Hosea,10,7,Samaria’s king will disappear like foam on the surface of the water.
Hosea,10,8,"The high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed; thorns and thistles will grow over their altars. They will say to the mountains, “Cover us!” and to the hills, “Fall on us!”"
Hosea,10,9,"Israel, you have sinned since the days of Gibeah; they have taken their stand there. Will not war against the unjust overtake them in Gibeah?"
Hosea,10,10,I will discipline them at My discretion; nations will be gathered against them to put them in bondage for their two crimes.
Hosea,10,11,"Ephraim is a well-trained calf that loves to thresh, but I will place a yoke on her fine neck. I will harness Ephraim; Judah will plow; Jacob will do the final plowing."
Hosea,10,12,Sow righteousness for yourselves and reap faithful love; break up your unplowed ground. It is time to seek the LORD until He comes and sends righteousness on you like the rain.
Hosea,10,13,"You have plowed wickedness and reaped injustice; you have eaten the fruit of lies. Because you have trusted in your own way and in your large number of soldiers,"
Hosea,10,14,"the roar of battle will rise against your people, and all your fortifications will be demolished in a day of war, like Shalman’s destruction of Beth-arbel. Mothers will be dashed to pieces along with their children."
Hosea,10,15,"So it will be done to you, Bethel, because of your extreme evil. At dawn the king of Israel will be totally destroyed."
Hosea,11,1,"When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called My son."
Hosea,11,2,"The more they called them, the more they departed from Me. They kept sacrificing to the Baals and burning offerings to idols."
Hosea,11,3,"It was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them in My arms, but they never knew that I healed them."
Hosea,11,4,"I led them with human cords, with ropes of love. To them I was like one who eases the yoke from their jaws; I bent down to give them food."
Hosea,11,5,"Israel will not return to the land of Egypt and Assyria will be his king, because they refused to repent."
Hosea,11,6,"A sword will whirl through his cities; it will destroy and devour the bars of his gates, because of their schemes."
Hosea,11,7,"My people are bent on turning from Me. Though they call to Him on high, He will not exalt them at all."
Hosea,11,8,"How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I surrender you, Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim? I have had a change of heart; My compassion is stirred!"
Hosea,11,9,"I will not vent the full fury of My anger; I will not turn back to destroy Ephraim. For I am God and not man, the Holy One among you; I will not come in rage."
Hosea,11,10,"They will follow the LORD; He will roar like a lion. When He roars, His children will come trembling from the west."
Hosea,11,11,They will be roused like birds from Egypt and like doves from the land of Assyria. Then I will settle them in their homes. This is the LORD’s declaration.
Hosea,11,12,"Ephraim surrounds me with lies, the house of Israel, with deceit. Judah still wanders with God and is faithful to the holy ones."
Hosea,12,1,"Ephraim chases the wind and pursues the east wind. He continually multiplies lies and violence. He makes a covenant with Assyria, and olive oil is carried to Egypt."
Hosea,12,2,The LORD also has a dispute with Judah. He is about to punish Jacob according to his ways; He will repay him based on his actions.
Hosea,12,3,"In the womb he grasped his brother’s heel, and as an adult he wrestled with God."
Hosea,12,4,"Jacob struggled with the Angel and prevailed; he wept and sought His favor. He found him at Bethel, and there He spoke with him."
Hosea,12,5,Yahweh is the God of Hosts; Yahweh is His name.
Hosea,12,6,"But you must return to your God. Maintain love and justice, and always put your hope in God."
Hosea,12,7,A merchant loves to extort with dishonest scales in his hands.
Hosea,12,8,"But Ephraim says: “How rich I have become; I made it all myself. In all my earnings, no one can find any crime in me that I can be punished for!”"
Hosea,12,9,"I have been Yahweh your God ever since the land of Egypt. I will make you live in tents again, as in the festival days."
Hosea,12,10,I spoke through the prophets and granted many visions; I gave parables through the prophets.
Hosea,12,11,"Since Gilead is full of evil, they will certainly come to nothing. They sacrifice bulls in Gilgal; even their altars will be like heaps of rocks on the furrows of a field."
Hosea,12,12,Jacob fled to the land of Aram. Israel worked to earn a wife; he tended flocks for a wife.
Hosea,12,13,"The LORD brought Israel from Egypt by a prophet, and Israel was tended by a prophet."
Hosea,12,14,"Ephraim has provoked bitter anger, so his Lord will leave his bloodguilt on him and repay him for his contempt."
Hosea,13,1,"When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling; he was exalted in Israel. But he incurred guilt through Baal and died."
Hosea,13,2,"Now they continue to sin and make themselves a cast image, idols skillfully made from their silver, all of them the work of craftsmen. People say about them, “Let the men who sacrifice kiss the calves.”"
Hosea,13,3,"Therefore, they will be like the morning mist, like the early dew that vanishes, like chaff blown from a threshing floor, or like smoke from a window."
Hosea,13,4,"I have been Yahweh your God ever since the land of Egypt; you know no God but Me, and no Savior exists besides Me."
Hosea,13,5,"I knew you in the wilderness, in the land of drought."
Hosea,13,6,"When they had pasture, they became satisfied; they were satisfied, and their hearts became proud. Therefore they forgot Me."
Hosea,13,7,So I will be like a lion to them; I will lurk like a leopard on the path.
Hosea,13,8,"I will attack them like a bear robbed of her cubs and tear open the rib cage over their hearts. I will devour them there like a lioness, like a wild beast that would rip them open."
Hosea,13,9,"I will destroy you, Israel; you have no help but Me."
Hosea,13,10,"Where now is your king, that he may save you in all your cities, and the rulers you demanded, saying, “Give me a king and leaders”?"
Hosea,13,11,I give you a king in My anger and take away a king in My wrath.
Hosea,13,12,Ephraim’s guilt is preserved; his sin is stored up.
Hosea,13,13,"Labor pains come on him. He is not a wise son; when the time comes, he will not be born."
Hosea,13,14,"I will ransom them from the power of Sheol. I will redeem them from death. Death, where are your barbs? Sheol, where is your sting? Compassion is hidden from My eyes."
Hosea,13,15,"Although he flourishes among his brothers, an east wind will come, a wind from the LORD rising up from the desert. His water source will fail, and his spring will run dry. The wind will plunder the treasury of every precious item."
Hosea,13,16,"Samaria will bear her guilt because she has rebelled against her God. They will fall by the sword; their little ones will be dashed to pieces, and their pregnant women ripped open."
Hosea,14,1,"Israel, return to Yahweh your God, for you have stumbled in your sin."
Hosea,14,2,"Take words of repentance with you and return to the LORD. Say to Him: “Forgive all our sin and accept what is good, so that we may repay You with praise from our lips."
Hosea,14,3,"Assyria will not save us, we will not ride on horses, and we will no longer proclaim, ‘Our gods!’ to the work of our hands. For the fatherless receives compassion in You.”"
Hosea,14,4,"I will heal their apostasy; I will freely love them, for My anger will have turned from him."
Hosea,14,5,I will be like the dew to Israel; he will blossom like the lily and take root like the cedars of Lebanon.
Hosea,14,6,"His new branches will spread, and his splendor will be like the olive tree, his fragrance, like the forest of Lebanon."
Hosea,14,7,The people will return and live beneath his shade. They will grow grain and blossom like the vine. His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon.
Hosea,14,8,"Ephraim, why should I have anything more to do with idols? It is I who answer and watch over him. I am like a flourishing pine tree; your fruit comes from Me."
Hosea,14,9,"Let whoever is wise understand these things, and whoever is insightful recognize them. For the ways of the LORD are right, and the righteous walk in them, but the rebellious stumble in them."
Joel,1,1,The word of the LORD that came to Joel son of Pethuel:
Joel,1,2,"Hear this, you elders; listen, all you inhabitants of the land. Has anything like this ever happened in your days or in the days of your ancestors?"
Joel,1,3,"Tell your children about it, and let your children tell their children, and their children the next generation."
Joel,1,4,"What the devouring locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten; what the swarming locust has left, the young locust has eaten; and what the young locust has left, the destroying locust has eaten."
Joel,1,5,"Wake up, you drunkards, and weep; wail, all you wine drinkers, because of the sweet wine, for it has been taken from your mouth."
Joel,1,6,"For a nation has invaded My land, powerful and without number; its teeth are the teeth of a lion, and it has the fangs of a lioness."
Joel,1,7,It has devastated My grapevine and splintered My fig tree. It has stripped off its bark and thrown it away; its branches have turned white.
Joel,1,8,"Grieve like a young woman dressed in sackcloth, mourning for the husband of her youth."
Joel,1,9,"Grain and drink offerings have been cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, who are ministers of the LORD, mourn."
Joel,1,10,"The fields are destroyed; the land grieves; indeed, the grain is destroyed; the new wine is dried up; and the olive oil fails."
Joel,1,11,"Be ashamed, you farmers, wail, you vinedressers, over the wheat and the barley, because the harvest of the field has perished."
Joel,1,12,"The grapevine is dried up, and the fig tree is withered; the pomegranate, the date palm, and the apple— all the trees of the orchard—have withered. Indeed, human joy has dried up."
Joel,1,13,"Dress in sackcloth and lament, you priests; wail, you ministers of the altar. Come and spend the night in sackcloth, you ministers of my God, because grain and drink offerings are withheld from the house of your God."
Joel,1,14,"Announce a sacred fast; proclaim an assembly! Gather the elders and all the residents of the land at the house of the LORD your God, and cry out to the LORD."
Joel,1,15,Woe because of that day! For the Day of the LORD is near and will come as devastation from the Almighty.
Joel,1,16,"Hasn’t the food been cut off before our eyes, joy and gladness from the house of our God?"
Joel,1,17,"The seeds lie shriveled in their casings. The storehouses are in ruin, and the granaries are broken down, because the grain has withered away."
Joel,1,18,How the animals groan! The herds of cattle wander in confusion since they have no pasture. Even the flocks of sheep suffer punishment.
Joel,1,19,"I call to You, LORD, for fire has consumed the pastures of the wilderness, and flames have devoured all the trees of the countryside."
Joel,1,20,"Even the wild animals cry out to You, for the river beds are dried up, and fire has consumed the pastures of the wilderness."
Joel,2,1,"Blow the horn in Zion; sound the alarm on My holy mountain! Let all the residents of the land tremble, for the Day of the LORD is coming; in fact, it is near—"
Joel,2,2,"a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and dense overcast, like the dawn spreading over the mountains; a great and strong people appears, such as never existed in ages past and never will again in all the generations to come."
Joel,2,3,"A fire destroys in front of them, and behind them a flame devours. The land in front of them is like the Garden of Eden, but behind them, it is like a desert wasteland; there is no escape from them."
Joel,2,4,"Their appearance is like that of horses, and they gallop like war horses."
Joel,2,5,"They bound on the tops of the mountains. Their sound is like the sound of chariots, like the sound of fiery flames consuming stubble, like a mighty army deployed for war."
Joel,2,6,Nations writhe in horror before them; all faces turn pale.
Joel,2,7,"They attack as warriors attack; they scale walls as men of war do. Each goes on his own path, and they do not change their course."
Joel,2,8,"They do not push each other; each man proceeds on his own path. They dodge the arrows, never stopping."
Joel,2,9,They storm the city; they run on the wall; they climb into the houses; they enter through the windows like thieves.
Joel,2,10,"The earth quakes before them; the sky shakes. The sun and moon grow dark, and the stars cease their shining."
Joel,2,11,"The LORD raises His voice in the presence of His army. His camp is very large; Those who carry out His command are powerful. Indeed, the Day of the LORD is terrible and dreadful— who can endure it?"
Joel,2,12,"Even now— this is the LORD’s declaration— turn to Me with all your heart, with fasting, weeping, and mourning."
Joel,2,13,"Tear your hearts, not just your clothes, and return to the LORD your God. For He is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, rich in faithful love, and He relents from sending disaster."
Joel,2,14,"Who knows? He may turn and relent and leave a blessing behind Him, so you can offer grain and wine to the LORD your God."
Joel,2,15,Blow the horn in Zion! Announce a sacred fast; proclaim an assembly.
Joel,2,16,"Gather the people; sanctify the congregation; assemble the aged; gather the children, even those nursing at the breast. Let the groom leave his bedroom, and the bride her honeymoon chamber."
Joel,2,17,"Let the priests, the LORD’s ministers, weep between the portico and the altar. Let them say: “Have pity on Your people, LORD, and do not make Your inheritance a disgrace, an object of scorn among the nations. Why should it be said among the peoples, ‘Where is their God?’”"
Joel,2,18,Then the LORD became jealous for His land and spared His people.
Joel,2,19,"The LORD answered His people: Look, I am about to send you grain, new wine, and olive oil. You will be satiated with them, and I will no longer make you a disgrace among the nations."
Joel,2,20,"I will drive the northerner far from you and banish him to a dry and desolate land, his front ranks into the Dead Sea, and his rear guard into the Mediterranean Sea. His stench will rise; yes, his rotten smell will rise, for he has done catastrophic things."
Joel,2,21,"Don’t be afraid, land; rejoice and be glad, for the LORD has done great things."
Joel,2,22,"Don’t be afraid, wild animals, for the wilderness pastures have turned green, the trees bear their fruit, and the fig tree and grapevine yield their riches."
Joel,2,23,"Children of Zion, rejoice and be glad in the LORD your God, because He gives you the autumn rain for your vindication. He sends showers for you, both autumn and spring rain as before."
Joel,2,24,"The threshing floors will be full of grain, and the vats will overflow with new wine and olive oil."
Joel,2,25,"I will repay you for the years that the swarming locust ate, the young locust, the destroying locust, and the devouring locust— My great army that I sent against you."
Joel,2,26,"You will have plenty to eat and be satisfied. You will praise the name of Yahweh your God, who has dealt wondrously with you. My people will never again be put to shame."
Joel,2,27,"You will know that I am present in Israel and that I am Yahweh your God, and there is no other. My people will never again be put to shame."
Joel,2,28,"After this I will pour out My Spirit on all humanity; then your sons and your daughters will prophesy, your old men will have dreams, and your young men will see visions."
Joel,2,29,I will even pour out My Spirit on the male and female slaves in those days.
Joel,2,30,"I will display wonders in the heavens and on the earth: blood, fire, and columns of smoke."
Joel,2,31,The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the great and awe-inspiring Day of the LORD comes.
Joel,2,32,"Then everyone who calls on the name of Yahweh will be saved, for there will be an escape for those on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, as the LORD promised, among the survivors the LORD calls."
Joel,3,1,"Yes, in those days and at that time, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,"
Joel,3,2,"I will gather all the nations and take them to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. I will enter into judgment with them there because of My people, My inheritance Israel. The nations have scattered the Israelites in foreign countries and divided up My land."
Joel,3,3,They cast lots for My people; they bartered a boy for a prostitute and sold a girl for wine to drink.
Joel,3,4,"And also: Tyre, Sidon, and all the territories of Philistia—what are you to Me? Are you paying Me back or trying to get even with Me? I will quickly bring retribution on your heads."
Joel,3,5,For you took My silver and gold and carried My finest treasures to your temples.
Joel,3,6,You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks to remove them far from their own territory.
Joel,3,7,"Look, I am about to rouse them up from the place where you sold them; I will bring retribution on your heads."
Joel,3,8,"I will sell your sons and daughters into the hands of the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a distant nation, for the LORD has spoken."
Joel,3,9,Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare for holy war; rouse the warriors; let all the men of war advance and attack!
Joel,3,10,"Beat your plows into swords and your pruning knives into spears. Let even the weakling say, “I am a warrior.”"
Joel,3,11,"Come quickly, all you surrounding nations; gather yourselves. Bring down Your warriors there, LORD."
Joel,3,12,"Let the nations be roused and come to the Valley of Jehoshaphat, for there I will sit down to judge all the surrounding nations."
Joel,3,13,Swing the sickle because the harvest is ripe. Come and trample the grapes because the winepress is full; the wine vats overflow because the wickedness of the nations is great.
Joel,3,14,"Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the Day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision."
Joel,3,15,"The sun and moon will grow dark, and the stars will cease their shining."
Joel,3,16,"The LORD will roar from Zion and raise His voice from Jerusalem; heaven and earth will shake. But the LORD will be a refuge for His people, a stronghold for the Israelites."
Joel,3,17,"Then you will know that I am Yahweh your God, who dwells in Zion, My holy mountain. Jerusalem will be holy, and foreigners will never overrun it again."
Joel,3,18,"In that day the mountains will drip with sweet wine, and the hills will flow with milk. All the streams of Judah will flow with water, and a spring will issue from the LORD’s house, watering the Valley of Acacias."
Joel,3,19,"Egypt will become desolate, and Edom a desert wasteland, because of the violence done to the people of Judah in whose land they shed innocent blood."
Joel,3,20,"But Judah will be inhabited forever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation."
Joel,3,21,"I will pardon their bloodguilt, which I have not pardoned, for the LORD dwells in Zion."
Amos,1,1,"The words of Amos, who was one of the sheep breeders from Tekoa—what he saw regarding Israel in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah, and Jeroboam son of Jehoash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake."
Amos,1,2,"He said: The LORD roars from Zion and raises His voice from Jerusalem; the pastures of the shepherds mourn, and the summit of Carmel withers."
Amos,1,3,"The LORD says: I will not relent from punishing Damascus for three crimes, even four, because they threshed Gilead with iron sledges."
Amos,1,4,"Therefore, I will send fire against Hazael’s palace, and it will consume Ben-hadad’s citadels."
Amos,1,5,"I will break down the gates of Damascus. I will cut off the ruler from the Valley of Aven, and the one who wields the scepter from Beth-eden. The people of Aram will be exiled to Kir. The LORD has spoken."
Amos,1,6,"The LORD says: I will not relent from punishing Gaza for three crimes, even four, because they exiled a whole community, handing them over to Edom."
Amos,1,7,"Therefore, I will send fire against the walls of Gaza, and it will consume its citadels."
Amos,1,8,"I will cut off the ruler from Ashdod, and the one who wields the scepter from Ashkelon. I will also turn My hand against Ekron, and the remainder of the Philistines will perish. The Lord GOD has spoken."
Amos,1,9,"The LORD says: I will not relent from punishing Tyre for three crimes, even four, because they handed over a whole community of exiles to Edom and broke a treaty of brotherhood."
Amos,1,10,"Therefore, I will send fire against the walls of Tyre, and it will consume its citadels."
Amos,1,11,"The LORD says: I will not relent from punishing Edom for three crimes, even four, because he pursued his brother with the sword. He stifled his compassion, his anger tore at them continually, and he harbored his rage incessantly."
Amos,1,12,"Therefore, I will send fire against Teman, and it will consume the citadels of Bozrah."
Amos,1,13,"The LORD says: I will not relent from punishing the Ammonites for three crimes, even four, because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead in order to enlarge their territory."
Amos,1,14,"Therefore, I will set fire to the walls of Rabbah, and it will consume its citadels. There will be shouting on the day of battle and a violent wind on the day of the storm."
Amos,1,15,Their king and his princes will go into exile together. The LORD has spoken.
Amos,2,1,"The LORD says: I will not relent from punishing Moab for three crimes, even four, because he burned the bones of the king of Edom to lime."
Amos,2,2,"Therefore, I will send fire against Moab, and it will consume the citadels of Kerioth. Moab will die with a tumult, with shouting and the sound of the ram’s horn."
Amos,2,3,I will cut off the judge from the land and kill all its officials with him. The LORD has spoken.
Amos,2,4,"The LORD says: I will not relent from punishing Judah for three crimes, even four, because they have rejected the instruction of the LORD and have not kept His statutes. The lies that their ancestors followed have led them astray."
Amos,2,5,"Therefore, I will send fire against Judah, and it will consume the citadels of Jerusalem."
Amos,2,6,"The LORD says: I will not relent from punishing Israel for three crimes, even four, because they sell a righteous person for silver and a needy person for a pair of sandals."
Amos,2,7,"They trample the heads of the poor on the dust of the ground and block the path of the needy. A man and his father have sexual relations with the same girl, profaning My holy name."
Amos,2,8,"They stretch out beside every altar on garments taken as collateral, and in the house of their God, they drink wine obtained through fines."
Amos,2,9,"Yet I destroyed the Amorite as Israel advanced; his height was like the cedars, and he was as sturdy as the oaks; I destroyed his fruit above and his roots beneath."
Amos,2,10,And I brought you from the land of Egypt and led you 40 years in the wilderness in order to possess the land of the Amorite.
Amos,2,11,"I raised up some of your sons as prophets and some of your young men as Nazirites. Is this not the case, Israelites? This is the LORD’s declaration."
Amos,2,12,"But you made the Nazirites drink wine and commanded the prophets, “Do not prophesy.”"
Amos,2,13,"Look, I am about to crush you in your place as a wagon full of sheaves crushes grain."
Amos,2,14,"Escape will fail the swift, the strong one will not prevail by his strength, and the brave will not save his life."
Amos,2,15,"The archer will not stand his ground, the one who is swift of foot will not save himself, and the one riding a horse will not save his life."
Amos,2,16,Even the most courageous of the warriors will flee naked on that day— this is the LORD’s declaration.
Amos,3,1,"Listen to this message that the LORD has spoken against you, Israelites, against the entire clan that I brought from the land of Egypt:"
Amos,3,2,"I have known only you out of all the clans of the earth; therefore, I will punish you for all your iniquities."
Amos,3,3,Can two walk together without agreeing to meet?
Amos,3,4,Does a lion roar in the forest when it has no prey? Does a young lion growl from its lair unless it has captured something?
Amos,3,5,Does a bird land in a trap on the ground if there is no bait for it? Does a trap spring from the ground when it has caught nothing?
Amos,3,6,"If a ram’s horn is blown in a city, aren’t people afraid? If a disaster occurs in a city, hasn’t the LORD done it?"
Amos,3,7,"Indeed, the Lord GOD does nothing without revealing His counsel to His servants the prophets."
Amos,3,8,A lion has roared; who will not fear? The Lord GOD has spoken; who will not prophesy?
Amos,3,9,Proclaim on the citadels in Ashdod and on the citadels in the land of Egypt: Assemble on the mountains of Samaria and see the great turmoil in the city and the acts of oppression within it.
Amos,3,10,The people are incapable of doing right— this is the LORD’s declaration— those who store up violence and destruction in their citadels.
Amos,3,11,"Therefore, the Lord GOD says: An enemy will surround the land; he will destroy your strongholds and plunder your citadels."
Amos,3,12,"The LORD says: As the shepherd snatches two legs or a piece of an ear from the lion’s mouth, so the Israelites who live in Samaria will be rescued with only the corner of a bed or the cushion of a couch."
Amos,3,13,"Listen and testify against the house of Jacob— this is the declaration of the Lord GOD, the God of Hosts."
Amos,3,14,I will punish the altars of Bethel on the day I punish Israel for its crimes; the horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground.
Amos,3,15,"I will demolish the winter house and the summer house; the houses inlaid with ivory will be destroyed, and the great houses will come to an end. This is the LORD’s declaration."
Amos,4,1,"Listen to this message, you cows of Bashan who are on the hill of Samaria, women who oppress the poor and crush the needy, who say to their husbands, “Bring us something to drink.”"
Amos,4,2,"The Lord GOD has sworn by His holiness: Look, the days are coming when you will be taken away with hooks, every last one of you with fishhooks."
Amos,4,3,"You will go through breaches in the wall, each woman straight ahead, and you will be driven along toward Harmon. This is the LORD’s declaration."
Amos,4,4,"Come to Bethel and rebel; rebel even more at Gilgal! Bring your sacrifices every morning, your tenths every three days."
Amos,4,5,"Offer leavened bread as a thank offering, and loudly proclaim your freewill offerings, for that is what you Israelites love to do! This is the LORD’s declaration."
Amos,4,6,"I gave you absolutely nothing to eat in all your cities, a shortage of food in all your communities, yet you did not return to Me. This is the LORD’s declaration."
Amos,4,7,I also withheld the rain from you while there were still three months until harvest. I sent rain on one city but no rain on another. One field received rain while a field with no rain withered.
Amos,4,8,"Two or three cities staggered to another city to drink water but were not satisfied, yet you did not return to Me. This is the LORD’s declaration."
Amos,4,9,"I struck you with blight and mildew; the locust devoured your many gardens and vineyards, your fig trees and olive trees, yet you did not return to Me. This is the LORD’s declaration."
Amos,4,10,"I sent plagues like those of Egypt; I killed your young men with the sword, along with your captured horses. I caused the stench of your camp to fill your nostrils, yet you did not return to Me. This is the LORD’s declaration."
Amos,4,11,"I overthrew some of you as I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were like a burning stick snatched from a fire, yet you did not return to Me— this is the LORD’s declaration."
Amos,4,12,"Therefore, Israel, that is what I will do to you, and since I will do that to you, Israel, prepare to meet your God!"
Amos,4,13,"He is here: the One who forms the mountains, creates the wind, and reveals His thoughts to man, the One who makes the dawn out of darkness and strides on the heights of the earth. Yahweh, the God of Hosts, is His name."
Amos,5,1,"Listen to this message that I am singing for you, a lament, house of Israel:"
Amos,5,2,"She has fallen; Virgin Israel will never rise again. She lies abandoned on her land, with no one to raise her up."
Amos,5,3,"For the Lord GOD says: The city that marches out a thousand strong will have only a hundred left, and the one that marches out a hundred strong will have only ten left in the house of Israel."
Amos,5,4,For the LORD says to the house of Israel: Seek Me and live!
Amos,5,5,"Do not seek Bethel or go to Gilgal or journey to Beer-sheba, for Gilgal will certainly go into exile, and Bethel will come to nothing."
Amos,5,6,"Seek Yahweh and live, or He will spread like fire throughout the house of Joseph; it will consume everything, with no one at Bethel to extinguish it."
Amos,5,7,Those who turn justice into wormwood throw righteousness to the ground.
Amos,5,8,"The One who made the Pleiades and Orion, who turns darkness into dawn and darkens day into night, who summons the waters of the sea and pours them out over the face of the earth— Yahweh is His name."
Amos,5,9,"He brings destruction on the strong, and it falls on the stronghold."
Amos,5,10,They hate the one who convicts the guilty at the city gate and despise the one who speaks with integrity.
Amos,5,11,"Therefore, because you trample on the poor and exact a grain tax from him, you will never live in the houses of cut stone you have built; you will never drink the wine from the lush vineyards you have planted."
Amos,5,12,"For I know your crimes are many and your sins innumerable. They oppress the righteous, take a bribe, and deprive the poor of justice at the gates."
Amos,5,13,"Therefore, the wise person will keep silent at such a time, for the days are evil."
Amos,5,14,"Seek good and not evil so that you may live, and the LORD, the God of Hosts, will be with you, as you have claimed."
Amos,5,15,"Hate evil and love good; establish justice in the gate. Perhaps the LORD, the God of Hosts, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph."
Amos,5,16,"Therefore Yahweh, the God of Hosts, the Lord, says: There will be wailing in all the public squares; they will cry out in anguish in all the streets. The farmer will be called on to mourn, and professional mourners to wail."
Amos,5,17,"There will be wailing in all the vineyards, for I will pass among you. The LORD has spoken."
Amos,5,18,Woe to you who long for the Day of the LORD! What will the Day of the LORD be for you? It will be darkness and not light.
Amos,5,19,It will be like a man who flees from a lion only to have a bear confront him. He goes home and rests his hand against the wall only to have a snake bite him.
Amos,5,20,"Won’t the Day of the LORD be darkness rather than light, even gloom without any brightness in it?"
Amos,5,21,"I hate, I despise your feasts! I can’t stand the stench of your solemn assemblies."
Amos,5,22,"Even if you offer Me your burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them; I will have no regard for your fellowship offerings of fattened cattle."
Amos,5,23,Take away from Me the noise of your songs! I will not listen to the music of your harps.
Amos,5,24,"But let justice flow like water, and righteousness, like an unfailing stream."
Amos,5,25,"“House of Israel, was it sacrifices and grain offerings that you presented to Me during the 40 years in the wilderness?"
Amos,5,26,"But you have taken up Sakkuth your king and Kaiwan your star god, images you have made for yourselves."
Amos,5,27,"So I will send you into exile beyond Damascus.” Yahweh, the God of Hosts, is His name. He has spoken."
Amos,6,1,"Woe to those who are at ease in Zion and to those who feel secure on the hill of Samaria— the notable people in this first of the nations, those the house of Israel comes to."
Amos,6,2,Cross over to Calneh and see; go from there to great Hamath; then go down to Gath of the Philistines. Are you better than these kingdoms? Is their territory larger than yours?
Amos,6,3,You dismiss any thought of the evil day and bring in a reign of violence.
Amos,6,4,"They lie on beds inlaid with ivory, sprawled out on their couches, and dine on lambs from the flock and calves from the stall."
Amos,6,5,They improvise songs to the sound of the harp and invent their own musical instruments like David.
Amos,6,6,They drink wine by the bowlful and anoint themselves with the finest oils but do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph.
Amos,6,7,"Therefore, they will now go into exile as the first of the captives, and the feasting of those who sprawl out will come to an end."
Amos,6,8,"The Lord GOD has sworn by Himself—this is the declaration of Yahweh, the God of Hosts: I loathe Jacob’s pride and hate his citadels, so I will hand over the city and everything in it."
Amos,6,9,"And if there are 10 men left in one house, they will die."
Amos,6,10,"A close relative and burner will remove his corpse from the house. He will call to someone in the inner recesses of the house, “Any more with you?” That person will reply, “None.” Then he will say, “Silence, because Yahweh’s name must not be invoked.”"
Amos,6,11,"For the LORD commands: The large house will be smashed to pieces, and the small house to rubble."
Amos,6,12,Do horses gallop on the cliffs; does anyone plow there with oxen? Yet you have turned justice into poison and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood—
Amos,6,13,"you who rejoice over Lo-debar and say, “Didn’t we capture Karnaim for ourselves by our own strength?”"
Amos,6,14,"But look, I am raising up a nation against you, house of Israel— this is the declaration of the Lord, the GOD of Hosts— and they will oppress you from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of the Arabah."
Amos,7,1,The Lord GOD showed me this: He was forming a swarm of locusts at the time the spring crop first began to sprout—after the cutting of the king’s hay.
Amos,7,2,"When the locusts finished eating the vegetation of the land, I said, “Lord GOD, please forgive! How will Jacob survive since he is so small?”"
Amos,7,3,"The LORD relented concerning this. “It will not happen,” He said."
Amos,7,4,The Lord GOD showed me this: The Lord GOD was calling for a judgment by fire. It consumed the great deep and devoured the land.
Amos,7,5,"Then I said, “Lord GOD, please stop! How will Jacob survive since he is so small?”"
Amos,7,6,"The LORD relented concerning this. “This will not happen either,” said the Lord GOD."
Amos,7,7,He showed me this: The Lord was standing there by a vertical wall with a plumb line in His hand.
Amos,7,8,"The LORD asked me, “What do you see, Amos?” I replied, “A plumb line.” Then the Lord said, “I am setting a plumb line among My people Israel; I will no longer spare them:"
Amos,7,9,"Isaac’s high places will be deserted, and Israel’s sanctuaries will be in ruins; I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with a sword.”"
Amos,7,10,"Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent word to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, “Amos has conspired against you right here in the house of Israel. The land cannot endure all his words,"
Amos,7,11,"for Amos has said this: ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will certainly go into exile from its homeland.’”"
Amos,7,12,"Then Amaziah said to Amos, “Go away, you seer! Flee to the land of Judah. Earn your living and give your prophecies there,"
Amos,7,13,"but don’t ever prophesy at Bethel again, for it is the king’s sanctuary and a royal temple.”"
Amos,7,14,"So Amos answered Amaziah, “I was not a prophet or the son of a prophet; rather, I was a herdsman, and I took care of sycamore figs."
Amos,7,15,"But the LORD took me from following the flock and said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to My people Israel.’”"
Amos,7,16,Now hear the word of the LORD. You say: Do not prophesy against Israel; do not preach against the house of Isaac.
Amos,7,17,"Therefore, this is what the LORD says: Your wife will be a prostitute in the city, your sons and daughters will fall by the sword, and your land will be divided up with a measuring line. You yourself will die on pagan soil, and Israel will certainly go into exile from its homeland."
Amos,8,1,The Lord GOD showed me this: A basket of summer fruit.
Amos,8,2,"He asked me, “What do you see, Amos?” I replied, “A basket of summer fruit.” The LORD said to me, “The end has come for My people Israel; I will no longer spare them."
Amos,8,3,"In that day the temple songs will become wailing”—this is the Lord GOD’s declaration. “Many dead bodies, thrown everywhere! Silence!”"
Amos,8,4,"Hear this, you who trample on the needy and do away with the poor of the land,"
Amos,8,5,"asking, “When will the New Moon be over so we may sell grain, and the Sabbath, so we may market wheat? We can reduce the measure while increasing the price and cheat with dishonest scales."
Amos,8,6,We can buy the poor with silver and the needy for a pair of sandals and even sell the chaff!”
Amos,8,7,The LORD has sworn by the Pride of Jacob: I will never forget all their deeds.
Amos,8,8,"Because of this, won’t the land quake and all who dwell in it mourn? All of it will rise like the Nile; it will surge and then subside like the Nile in Egypt."
Amos,8,9,And in that day— this is the declaration of the Lord GOD— I will make the sun go down at noon; I will darken the land in the daytime.
Amos,8,10,I will turn your feasts into mourning and all your songs into lamentation; I will cause everyone to wear sackcloth and every head to be shaved. I will make that grief like mourning for an only son and its outcome like a bitter day.
Amos,8,11,"Hear this! The days are coming— this is the declaration of the Lord GOD— when I will send a famine through the land: not a famine of bread or a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD."
Amos,8,12,"People will stagger from sea to sea and roam from north to east, seeking the word of the LORD, but they will not find it."
Amos,8,13,"In that day the beautiful young women, the young men also, will faint from thirst."
Amos,8,14,"Those who swear by the guilt of Samaria and say, “As your god lives, Dan,” or “As the way of Beer-sheba lives”— they will fall, never to rise again."
Amos,9,1,"I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and He said: Strike the capitals of the pillars so that the thresholds shake; knock them down on the heads of all the people. Then I will kill the rest of them with the sword. None of those who flee will get away; none of the fugitives will escape."
Amos,9,2,"If they dig down to Sheol, from there My hand will take them; if they climb up to heaven, from there I will bring them down."
Amos,9,3,"If they hide themselves on the top of Carmel, from there I will track them down and seize them; if they conceal themselves from My sight on the sea floor, from there I will command the sea serpent to bite them."
Amos,9,4,"And if they are driven by their enemies into captivity, from there I will command the sword to kill them. I will fix My eyes on them for harm and not for good."
Amos,9,5,"The Lord, the GOD of Hosts— He touches the earth; it melts, and all who dwell in it mourn; all of it rises like the Nile and subsides like the Nile of Egypt."
Amos,9,6,He builds His upper chambers in the heavens and lays the foundation of His vault on the earth. He summons the waters of the sea and pours them out on the face of the earth. Yahweh is His name.
Amos,9,7,"Israelites, are you not like the Cushites to Me? This is the LORD’s declaration. Didn’t I bring Israel from the land of Egypt, the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Arameans from Kir?"
Amos,9,8,"Look, the eyes of the Lord GOD are on the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from the face of the earth. However, I will not totally destroy the house of Jacob— this is the LORD’s declaration—"
Amos,9,9,"for I am about to give the command, and I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations, as one shakes a sieve, but not a pebble will fall to the ground."
Amos,9,10,"All the sinners among My people who say: “Disaster will never overtake or confront us,” will die by the sword."
Amos,9,11,"In that day I will restore the fallen booth of David: I will repair its gaps, restore its ruins, and rebuild it as in the days of old,"
Amos,9,12,so that they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations that are called by My name— this is the LORD’s declaration— He will do this.
Amos,9,13,"Hear this! The days are coming— this is the LORD’s declaration— when the plowman will overtake the reaper and the one who treads grapes, the sower of seed. The mountains will drip with sweet wine, and all the hills will flow with it."
Amos,9,14,"I will restore the fortunes of My people Israel. They will rebuild and occupy ruined cities, plant vineyards and drink their wine, make gardens and eat their produce."
Amos,9,15,"I will plant them on their land, and they will never again be uprooted from the land I have given them. Yahweh your God has spoken."
Obadiah,1,1,"This is what the Lord GOD has said about Edom: We have heard a message from the LORD; a messenger has been sent among the nations: “Rise up, and let us go to war against her.”"
Obadiah,1,2,"Look, I will make you insignificant among the nations; you will be deeply despised."
Obadiah,1,3,"Your presumptuous heart has deceived you, you who live in clefts of the rock in your home on the heights, who say to yourself, “Who can bring me down to the ground?”"
Obadiah,1,4,"Though you seem to soar like an eagle and make your nest among the stars, even from there I will bring you down. This is the LORD’s declaration."
Obadiah,1,5,"If thieves came to you, if marauders by night— how ravaged you would be!— wouldn’t they steal only what they wanted? If grape pickers came to you, wouldn’t they leave some grapes?"
Obadiah,1,6,"How Esau will be pillaged, his hidden treasures searched out!"
Obadiah,1,7,Everyone who has a treaty with you will drive you to the border; everyone at peace with you will deceive and conquer you. Those who eat your bread will set a trap for you. He will be unaware of it.
Obadiah,1,8,In that day— this is the LORD’s declaration— will I not eliminate the wise ones of Edom and those who understand from the hill country of Esau?
Obadiah,1,9,"Teman, your warriors will be terrified so that everyone from the hill country of Esau will be destroyed by slaughter."
Obadiah,1,10,You will be covered with shame and destroyed forever because of violence done to your brother Jacob.
Obadiah,1,11,"On the day you stood aloof, on the day strangers captured his wealth, while foreigners entered his gate and cast lots for Jerusalem, you were just like one of them."
Obadiah,1,12,Do not gloat over your brother in the day of his calamity; do not rejoice over the people of Judah in the day of their destruction; do not boastfully mock in the day of distress.
Obadiah,1,13,"Do not enter the gate of My people in the day of their disaster. Yes, you—do not gloat over their misery in the day of their disaster and do not appropriate their possessions in the day of their disaster."
Obadiah,1,14,"Do not stand at the crossroads to cut off their fugitives, and do not hand over their survivors in the day of distress."
Obadiah,1,15,"For the Day of the LORD is near, against all the nations. As you have done, so it will be done to you; what you deserve will return on your own head."
Obadiah,1,16,"As you have drunk on My holy mountain, so all the nations will drink continually. They will drink and gulp down and be as though they had never been."
Obadiah,1,17,"But there will be a deliverance on Mount Zion, and it will be holy; the house of Jacob will dispossess those who dispossessed them."
Obadiah,1,18,"Then the house of Jacob will be a blazing fire, and the house of Joseph, a burning flame, but the house of Esau will be stubble; Jacob will set them on fire and consume Edom. Therefore no survivor will remain of the house of Esau, for the LORD has spoken."
Obadiah,1,19,"People from the Negev will possess the hill country of Esau; those from the Judean foothills will possess the land of the Philistines. They will possess the territories of Ephraim and Samaria, while Benjamin will possess Gilead."
Obadiah,1,20,The exiles of the Israelites who are in Halah and who are among the Canaanites as far as Zarephath as well as the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad will possess the cities of the Negev.
Obadiah,1,21,"Saviors will ascend Mount Zion to rule over the hill country of Esau, but the kingdom will be the LORD’s."
Jonah,1,1,The word of the LORD came to Jonah son of Amittai:
Jonah,1,2,"“Get up! Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it, because their wickedness has confronted Me.”"
Jonah,1,3,"However, Jonah got up to flee to Tarshish from the LORD’s presence. He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. He paid the fare and went down into it to go with them to Tarshish, from the LORD’s presence."
Jonah,1,4,"Then the LORD hurled a violent wind on the sea, and such a violent storm arose on the sea that the ship threatened to break apart."
Jonah,1,5,"The sailors were afraid, and each cried out to his god. They threw the ship’s cargo into the sea to lighten the load. Meanwhile, Jonah had gone down to the lowest part of the vessel and had stretched out and fallen into a deep sleep."
Jonah,1,6,"The captain approached him and said, “What are you doing sound asleep? Get up! Call to your god. Maybe this god will consider us, and we won’t perish.”"
Jonah,1,7,"“Come on!” the sailors said to each other. “Let’s cast lots. Then we’ll know who is to blame for this trouble we’re in.” So they cast lots, and the lot singled out Jonah."
Jonah,1,8,"Then they said to him, “Tell us who is to blame for this trouble we’re in. What is your business and where are you from? What is your country and what people are you from?”"
Jonah,1,9,"He answered them, “I’m a Hebrew. I worship Yahweh, the God of the heavens, who made the sea and the dry land.”"
Jonah,1,10,"Then the men were even more afraid and said to him, “What is this you’ve done?” The men knew he was fleeing from the LORD’s presence, because he had told them."
Jonah,1,11,"So they said to him, “What should we do to you to calm this sea that’s against us?” For the sea was getting worse and worse."
Jonah,1,12,"He answered them, “Pick me up and throw me into the sea so it may quiet down for you, for I know that I’m to blame for this violent storm that is against you.”"
Jonah,1,13,"Nevertheless, the men rowed hard to get back to dry land, but they couldn’t because the sea was raging against them more and more."
Jonah,1,14,"So they called out to the LORD: “Please, Yahweh, don’t let us perish because of this man’s life, and don’t charge us with innocent blood! For You, Yahweh, have done just as You pleased.”"
Jonah,1,15,"Then they picked up Jonah and threw him into the sea, and the sea stopped its raging."
Jonah,1,16,"The men feared the LORD even more, and they offered a sacrifice to the LORD and made vows."
Jonah,1,17,"Now the LORD had appointed a huge fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was in the fish three days and three nights."
Jonah,2,1,Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from inside the fish:
Jonah,2,2,"I called to the LORD in my distress, and He answered me. I cried out for help in the belly of Sheol; You heard my voice."
Jonah,2,3,"You threw me into the depths, into the heart of the seas, and the current overcame me. All Your breakers and Your billows swept over me."
Jonah,2,4,"But I said: I have been banished from Your sight, yet I will look once more toward Your holy temple."
Jonah,2,5,The waters engulfed me up to the neck; the watery depths overcame me; seaweed was wrapped around my head.
Jonah,2,6,"I sank to the foundations of the mountains; the earth with its prison bars closed behind me forever! But You raised my life from the Pit, LORD my God!"
Jonah,2,7,"As my life was fading away, I remembered Yahweh. My prayer came to You, to Your holy temple."
Jonah,2,8,"Those who cling to worthless idols forsake faithful love,"
Jonah,2,9,"but as for me, I will sacrifice to You with a voice of thanksgiving. I will fulfill what I have vowed. Salvation is from the LORD!"
Jonah,2,10,"Then the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land."
Jonah,3,1,Then the word of the LORD came to Jonah a second time:
Jonah,3,2,“Get up! Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach the message that I tell you.”
Jonah,3,3,"So Jonah got up and went to Nineveh according to the LORD’s command. Now Nineveh was an extremely large city, a three-day walk."
Jonah,3,4,"Jonah set out on the first day of his walk in the city and proclaimed, “In 40 days Nineveh will be demolished!”"
Jonah,3,5,The men of Nineveh believed in God. They proclaimed a fast and dressed in sackcloth—from the greatest of them to the least.
Jonah,3,6,"When word reached the king of Nineveh, he got up from his throne, took off his royal robe, put on sackcloth, and sat in ashes."
Jonah,3,7,"Then he issued a decree in Nineveh: By order of the king and his nobles: No man or beast, herd or flock, is to taste anything at all. They must not eat or drink water."
Jonah,3,8,"Furthermore, both man and beast must be covered with sackcloth, and everyone must call out earnestly to God. Each must turn from his evil ways and from the violence he is doing."
Jonah,3,9,Who knows? God may turn and relent; He may turn from His burning anger so that we will not perish.
Jonah,3,10,Then God saw their actions—that they had turned from their evil ways—so God relented from the disaster He had threatened to do to them. And He did not do it.
Jonah,4,1,But Jonah was greatly displeased and became furious.
Jonah,4,2,"He prayed to the LORD: “Please, LORD, isn’t this what I said while I was still in my own country? That’s why I fled toward Tarshish in the first place. I knew that You are a merciful and compassionate God, slow to become angry, rich in faithful love, and One who relents from sending disaster."
Jonah,4,3,"And now, LORD, please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live.”"
Jonah,4,4,"The LORD asked, “Is it right for you to be angry?”"
Jonah,4,5,Jonah left the city and sat down east of it. He made himself a shelter there and sat in its shade to see what would happen to the city.
Jonah,4,6,"Then the LORD God appointed a plant, and it grew up to provide shade over Jonah’s head to ease his discomfort. Jonah was greatly pleased with the plant."
Jonah,4,7,"When dawn came the next day, God appointed a worm that attacked the plant, and it withered."
Jonah,4,8,"As the sun was rising, God appointed a scorching east wind. The sun beat down so much on Jonah’s head that he almost fainted, and he wanted to die. He said, “It’s better for me to die than to live.”"
Jonah,4,9,"Then God asked Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry about the plant?” “Yes,” he replied. “It is right. I’m angry enough to die!”"
Jonah,4,10,"So the LORD said, “You cared about the plant, which you did not labor over and did not grow. It appeared in a night and perished in a night."
Jonah,4,11,"Should I not care about the great city of Nineveh, which has more than 120,000 people who cannot distinguish between their right and their left, as well as many animals?”"
Micah,1,1,"The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Moreshite—what he saw regarding Samaria and Jerusalem in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah."
Micah,1,2,"Listen, all you peoples; pay attention, earth and everyone in it! The Lord GOD will be a witness against you, the Lord, from His holy temple."
Micah,1,3,"Look, the LORD is leaving His place and coming down to trample the heights of the earth."
Micah,1,4,"The mountains will melt beneath Him, and the valleys will split apart, like wax near a fire, like water cascading down a mountainside."
Micah,1,5,All this will happen because of Jacob’s rebellion and the sins of the house of Israel. What is the rebellion of Jacob? Isn’t it Samaria? And what is the high place of Judah? Isn’t it Jerusalem?
Micah,1,6,"Therefore, I will make Samaria a heap of ruins in the countryside, a planting area for a vineyard. I will roll her stones into the valley and expose her foundations."
Micah,1,7,"All her carved images will be smashed to pieces; all her wages will be burned in the fire, and I will destroy all her idols. Since she collected the wages of a prostitute, they will be used again for a prostitute."
Micah,1,8,Because of this I will lament and wail; I will walk barefoot and naked. I will howl like the jackals and mourn like ostriches.
Micah,1,9,"For her wound is incurable and has reached even Judah; it has approached the gate of my people, as far as Jerusalem."
Micah,1,10,"Don’t announce it in Gath, don’t weep at all. Roll in the dust in Beth-leaphrah."
Micah,1,11,"Depart in shameful nakedness, you residents of Shaphir; the residents of Zaanan will not come out. Beth-ezel is lamenting; its support is taken from you."
Micah,1,12,"Though the residents of Maroth anxiously wait for something good, disaster has come from the LORD to the gate of Jerusalem."
Micah,1,13,"Harness the horses to the chariot, you residents of Lachish. This was the beginning of sin for Daughter Zion, because Israel’s acts of rebellion can be traced to you."
Micah,1,14,"Therefore, send farewell gifts to Moresheth-gath; the houses of Achzib are a deception to the kings of Israel."
Micah,1,15,I will again bring a conqueror against you who live in Mareshah. The nobility of Israel will come to Adullam.
Micah,1,16,"Shave yourselves bald and cut off your hair in sorrow for your precious children; make yourselves as bald as an eagle, for they have been taken from you into exile."
Micah,2,1,Woe to those who dream up wickedness and prepare evil plans on their beds! At morning light they accomplish it because the power is in their hands.
Micah,2,2,"They covet fields and seize them; they also take houses. They deprive a man of his home, a person of his inheritance."
Micah,2,3,"Therefore, the LORD says: I am now planning a disaster against this nation; you cannot free your necks from it. Then you will not walk so proudly because it will be an evil time."
Micah,2,4,"In that day one will take up a taunt against you, and lament mournfully, saying, “We are totally ruined! He measures out the allotted land of my people. How He removes it from me! He allots our fields to traitors.”"
Micah,2,5,"Therefore, there will be no one in the assembly of the LORD to divide the land by casting lots."
Micah,2,6,"“Quit your preaching,” they preach. “They should not preach these things; shame will not overtake us.”"
Micah,2,7,"House of Jacob, should it be asked, “Is the Spirit of the LORD impatient? Are these the things He does?” Don’t My words bring good to the one who walks uprightly?"
Micah,2,8,"But recently My people have risen up like an enemy: You strip off the splendid robe from those who are passing through confidently, like those returning from war."
Micah,2,9,"You force the women of My people out of their comfortable homes, and you take My blessing from their children forever."
Micah,2,10,"Get up and leave, for this is not your place of rest, because defilement brings destruction— a grievous destruction!"
Micah,2,11,"If a man of wind comes and invents lies: “I will preach to you about wine and beer,” he would be just the preacher for this people!"
Micah,2,12,"I will indeed gather all of you, Jacob; I will collect the remnant of Israel. I will bring them together like sheep in a pen, like a flock in the middle of its fold. It will be noisy with people."
Micah,2,13,"One who breaks open the way will advance before them; they will break out, pass through the gate, and leave by it. Their King will pass through before them, the LORD as their leader."
Micah,3,1,"Then I said, “Now listen, leaders of Jacob, you rulers of the house of Israel. Aren’t you supposed to know what is just?"
Micah,3,2,You hate good and love evil. You tear off people’s skin and strip their flesh from their bones.
Micah,3,3,"You eat the flesh of my people after you strip their skin from them and break their bones. You chop them up like flesh for the cooking pot, like meat in a cauldron.”"
Micah,3,4,"Then they will cry out to the LORD, but He will not answer them. He will hide His face from them at that time because of the crimes they have committed."
Micah,3,5,"This is what the LORD says concerning the prophets who lead my people astray, who proclaim peace when they have food to sink their teeth into but declare war against the one who puts nothing in their mouths."
Micah,3,6,"Therefore, it will be night for you— without visions; it will grow dark for you— without divination. The sun will set on these prophets, and the daylight will turn black over them."
Micah,3,7,Then the seers will be ashamed and the diviners disappointed. They will all cover their mouths because there will be no answer from God.
Micah,3,8,"As for me, however, I am filled with power by the Spirit of the LORD, with justice and courage, to proclaim to Jacob his rebellion and to Israel his sin."
Micah,3,9,"Listen to this, leaders of the house of Jacob, you rulers of the house of Israel, who abhor justice and pervert everything that is right,"
Micah,3,10,who build Zion with bloodshed and Jerusalem with injustice.
Micah,3,11,"Her leaders issue rulings for a bribe, her priests teach for payment, and her prophets practice divination for money. Yet they lean on the LORD, saying, “Isn’t the LORD among us? No disaster will overtake us.”"
Micah,3,12,"Therefore, because of you, Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become ruins, and the hill of the temple mount will be a thicket."
Micah,4,1,"In the last days the mountain of the LORD’s house will be established at the top of the mountains and will be raised above the hills. Peoples will stream to it,"
Micah,4,2,"and many nations will come and say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us about His ways so we may walk in His paths.” For instruction will go out of Zion and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem."
Micah,4,3,"He will settle disputes among many peoples and provide arbitration for strong nations that are far away. They will beat their swords into plows, and their spears into pruning knives. Nation will not take up the sword against nation, and they will never again train for war."
Micah,4,4,But each man will sit under his grapevine and under his fig tree with no one to frighten him. For the mouth of the LORD of Hosts has promised this.
Micah,4,5,"Though all the peoples each walk in the name of their gods, we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God forever and ever."
Micah,4,6,"On that day— this is the LORD’s declaration— I will assemble the lame and gather the scattered, those I have injured."
Micah,4,7,"I will make the lame into a remnant, those far removed into a strong nation. Then the LORD will rule over them in Mount Zion from this time on and forever."
Micah,4,8,"And you, watchtower for the flock, fortified hill of Daughter Zion, the former rule will come to you, sovereignty will come to Daughter Jerusalem."
Micah,4,9,"Now, why are you shouting loudly? Is there no king with you? Has your counselor perished so that anguish grips you like a woman in labor?"
Micah,4,10,"Writhe and cry out, Daughter Zion, like a woman in labor, for now you will leave the city and camp in the open fields. You will go to Babylon; there you will be rescued; there the LORD will redeem you from the power of your enemies!"
Micah,4,11,"Many nations have now assembled against you; they say, “Let her be defiled, and let us feast our eyes on Zion.”"
Micah,4,12,"But they do not know the LORD’s intentions or understand His plan, that He has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor."
Micah,4,13,"Rise and thresh, Daughter Zion, for I will make your horns iron and your hooves bronze, so you can crush many peoples. Then you will set apart their plunder to the LORD for destruction, their wealth to the Lord of all the earth."
Micah,5,1,"Now, daughter who is under attack, you slash yourself in grief; a siege is set against us! They are striking the judge of Israel on the cheek with a rod."
Micah,5,2,"Bethlehem Ephrathah, you are small among the clans of Judah; One will come from you to be ruler over Israel for Me. His origin is from antiquity, from eternity."
Micah,5,3,"Therefore, He will abandon them until the time when she who is in labor has given birth; then the rest of His brothers will return to the people of Israel."
Micah,5,4,"He will stand and shepherd them in the strength of Yahweh, in the majestic name of Yahweh His God. They will live securely, for then His greatness will extend to the ends of the earth."
Micah,5,5,"He will be their peace. When Assyria invades our land, when it marches against our fortresses, we will raise against it seven shepherds, even eight leaders of men."
Micah,5,6,"They will shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword, the land of Nimrod with a drawn blade. So He will rescue us from Assyria when it invades our land, when it marches against our territory."
Micah,5,7,"Then the remnant of Jacob will be among many peoples like dew from the LORD, like showers on the grass, which do not wait for anyone or linger for mankind."
Micah,5,8,"Then the remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, among many peoples, like a lion among animals of the forest, like a young lion among flocks of sheep, which tramples and tears as it passes through, and there is no one to rescue them."
Micah,5,9,"Your hand will be lifted up against your adversaries, and all your enemies will be destroyed."
Micah,5,10,In that day— this is the LORD’s declaration— I will remove your horses from you and wreck your chariots.
Micah,5,11,I will remove the cities of your land and tear down all your fortresses.
Micah,5,12,"I will remove sorceries from your hands, and you will not have any more fortune-tellers."
Micah,5,13,I will remove your carved images and sacred pillars from you so that you will not bow down again to the work of your hands.
Micah,5,14,I will pull up the Asherah poles from among you and demolish your cities.
Micah,5,15,I will take vengeance in anger and wrath against the nations that have not obeyed Me.
Micah,6,1,"Now listen to what the LORD is saying: Rise, plead your case before the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice."
Micah,6,2,"Listen to the LORD’s lawsuit, you mountains and enduring foundations of the earth, because the LORD has a case against His people, and He will argue it against Israel."
Micah,6,3,"My people, what have I done to you, or how have I wearied you? Testify against Me!"
Micah,6,4,"Indeed, I brought you up from the land of Egypt and redeemed you from that place of slavery. I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam ahead of you."
Micah,6,5,"My people, remember what Balak king of Moab proposed, what Balaam son of Beor answered him, and what happened from the Acacia Grove to Gilgal so that you may acknowledge the LORD’s righteous acts."
Micah,6,6,"What should I bring before the LORD when I come to bow before God on high? Should I come before Him with burnt offerings, with year-old calves?"
Micah,6,7,"Would the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams or with ten thousand streams of oil? Should I give my firstborn for my transgression, the child of my body for my own sin?"
Micah,6,8,"Mankind, He has told you what is good and what it is the LORD requires of you: to act justly, to love faithfulness, and to walk humbly with your God."
Micah,6,9,The voice of Yahweh calls out to the city (and it is wise to fear Your name): “Pay attention to the rod and the One who ordained it.
Micah,6,10,Are there still the treasures of wickedness and the accursed short measure in the house of the wicked?
Micah,6,11,Can I excuse wicked scales or bags of deceptive weights?
Micah,6,12,"For the wealthy of the city are full of violence, and its residents speak lies; the tongues in their mouths are deceitful."
Micah,6,13,"“As a result, I have begun to strike you severely, bringing desolation because of your sins."
Micah,6,14,"You will eat but not be satisfied, for there will be hunger within you. What you acquire, you cannot save, and what you do save, I will give to the sword."
Micah,6,15,You will sow but not reap; you will press olives but not anoint yourself with oil; and you will tread grapes but not drink the wine.
Micah,6,16,"The statutes of Omri and all the practices of Ahab’s house have been observed; you have followed their policies. Therefore, I will make you a desolate place and the city’s residents an object of contempt; you will bear the scorn of My people.”"
Micah,7,1,"How sad for me! For I am like one who— when the summer fruit has been gathered after the gleaning of the grape harvest— finds no grape cluster to eat, no early fig, which I crave."
Micah,7,2,Godly people have vanished from the land; there is no one upright among the people. All of them wait in ambush to shed blood; they hunt each other with a net.
Micah,7,3,"Both hands are good at accomplishing evil: the official and the judge demand a bribe; when the powerful man communicates his evil desire, they plot it together."
Micah,7,4,"The best of them is like a brier; the most upright is worse than a hedge of thorns. The day of your watchmen, the day of your punishment, is coming; at this time their panic is here."
Micah,7,5,Do not rely on a friend; don’t trust in a close companion. Seal your mouth from the woman who lies in your arms.
Micah,7,6,"Surely a son considers his father a fool, a daughter opposes her mother, and a daughter-in-law is against her mother-in-law; a man’s enemies are the men of his own household."
Micah,7,7,But I will look to the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me.
Micah,7,8,"Do not rejoice over me, my enemy! Though I have fallen, I will stand up; though I sit in darkness, the LORD will be my light."
Micah,7,9,"Because I have sinned against Him, I must endure the LORD’s rage until He argues my case and establishes justice for me. He will bring me into the light; I will see His salvation."
Micah,7,10,"Then my enemy will see, and she will be covered with shame, the one who said to me, “Where is the LORD your God?” My eyes will look at her in triumph; at that time she will be trampled like mud in the streets."
Micah,7,11,A day will come for rebuilding your walls; on that day your boundary will be extended.
Micah,7,12,"On that day people will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, even from Egypt to the Euphrates River and from sea to sea and mountain to mountain."
Micah,7,13,Then the earth will become a wasteland because of its inhabitants and as a result of their actions.
Micah,7,14,"Shepherd Your people with Your staff, the flock that is Your possession. They live alone in a woodland surrounded by pastures. Let them graze in Bashan and Gilead as in ancient times."
Micah,7,15,I will perform miracles for them as in the days of your exodus from the land of Egypt.
Micah,7,16,"Nations will see and be ashamed of all their power. They will put their hands over their mouths, and their ears will become deaf."
Micah,7,17,They will lick the dust like a snake; they will come trembling out of their hiding places like reptiles slithering on the ground. They will tremble in the presence of Yahweh our God; they will stand in awe of You.
Micah,7,18,"Who is a God like You, removing iniquity and passing over rebellion for the remnant of His inheritance? He does not hold on to His anger forever, because He delights in faithful love."
Micah,7,19,He will again have compassion on us; He will vanquish our iniquities. You will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea.
Micah,7,20,"You will show loyalty to Jacob and faithful love to Abraham, as You swore to our fathers from days long ago."
Nahum,1,1,The oracle concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
Nahum,1,2,The LORD is a jealous and avenging God; the LORD takes vengeance and is fierce in wrath. The LORD takes vengeance against His foes; He is furious with His enemies.
Nahum,1,3,"The LORD is slow to anger but great in power; the LORD will never leave the guilty unpunished. His path is in the whirlwind and storm, and clouds are the dust beneath His feet."
Nahum,1,4,"He rebukes the sea so that it dries up, and He makes all the rivers run dry. Bashan and Carmel wither; even the flower of Lebanon withers."
Nahum,1,5,"The mountains quake before Him, and the hills melt; the earth trembles at His presence— the world and all who live in it."
Nahum,1,6,"Who can withstand His indignation? Who can endure His burning anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, even rocks are shattered before Him."
Nahum,1,7,"The LORD is good, a stronghold in a day of distress; He cares for those who take refuge in Him."
Nahum,1,8,"But He will completely destroy Nineveh with an overwhelming flood, and He will chase His enemies into darkness."
Nahum,1,9,"Whatever you plot against the LORD, He will bring it to complete destruction; oppression will not rise up a second time."
Nahum,1,10,"For they will be consumed like entangled thorns, like the drink of a drunkard and like straw that is fully dry."
Nahum,1,11,"One has gone out from you, who plots evil against Yahweh, and is a wicked counselor."
Nahum,1,12,"This is what the LORD says: Though they are strong and numerous, they will still be mowed down, and he will pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no longer."
Nahum,1,13,For I will now break off his yoke from you and tear off your shackles.
Nahum,1,14,"The LORD has issued an order concerning you: There will be no offspring to carry on your name. I will eliminate the carved idol and cast image from the house of your gods; I will prepare your grave, for you are contemptible."
Nahum,1,15,"Look to the mountains— the feet of one bringing good news and proclaiming peace! Celebrate your festivals, Judah; fulfill your vows. For the wicked one will never again march through you; he will be entirely wiped out."
Nahum,2,1,One who scatters is coming up against you. Man the fortifications! Watch the road! Brace yourself! Summon all your strength!
Nahum,2,2,"For the LORD will restore the majesty of Jacob, yes, the majesty of Israel, though ravagers have ravaged them and ruined their vine branches."
Nahum,2,3,"The shields of his warriors are dyed red; the valiant men are dressed in scarlet. The fittings of the chariot flash like fire on the day of its battle preparations, and the spears are brandished."
Nahum,2,4,The chariots dash madly through the streets; they rush around in the plazas. They look like torches; they dart back and forth like lightning.
Nahum,2,5,He gives orders to his officers; they stumble as they advance. They race to its wall; the protective shield is set in place.
Nahum,2,6,"The river gates are opened, and the palace erodes away."
Nahum,2,7,"Beauty is stripped, she is carried away; her ladies-in-waiting moan like the sound of doves, and beat their breasts."
Nahum,2,8,"Nineveh has been like a pool of water from her first days, but they are fleeing. “Stop! Stop!” they cry, but no one turns back."
Nahum,2,9,"“Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold!” There is no end to the treasure, an abundance of every precious thing."
Nahum,2,10,"Desolation, decimation, devastation! Hearts melt, knees tremble, loins shake, every face grows pale!"
Nahum,2,11,"Where is the lions’ lair, or the feeding ground of the young lions, where the lion and lioness prowled, and the lion’s cub, with nothing to frighten them away?"
Nahum,2,12,"The lion mauled whatever its cubs needed and strangled prey for its lionesses. It filled up its dens with the kill, and its lairs with mauled prey."
Nahum,2,13,"Beware, I am against you. This is the declaration of the LORD of Hosts. I will make your chariots go up in smoke and the sword will devour your young lions. I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the sound of your messengers will never be heard again."
Nahum,3,1,"Woe to the city of blood, totally deceitful, full of plunder, never without prey."
Nahum,3,2,"The crack of the whip and rumble of the wheel, galloping horse and jolting chariot!"
Nahum,3,3,"Charging horseman, flashing sword, shining spear; heaps of slain, mounds of corpses, dead bodies without end— they stumble over their dead."
Nahum,3,4,"Because of the continual prostitution of the prostitute, the attractive mistress of sorcery, who betrays nations by her prostitution and clans by her witchcraft,"
Nahum,3,5,"I am against you. This is the declaration of the LORD of Hosts. I will lift your skirts over your face and display your nakedness to nations, your shame to kingdoms."
Nahum,3,6,I will throw filth on you and treat you with contempt; I will make a spectacle of you.
Nahum,3,7,"Then all who see you will recoil from you, saying, “Nineveh is devastated; who will show sympathy to her?” Where can I find anyone to comfort you?"
Nahum,3,8,"Are you better than Thebes that sat along the Nile with water surrounding her, whose rampart was the sea, the river her wall?"
Nahum,3,9,Cush and Egypt were her endless source of strength; Put and Libya were among her allies.
Nahum,3,10,"Yet she became an exile; she went into captivity. Her children were also dashed to pieces at the head of every street. They cast lots for her dignitaries, and all her nobles were bound in chains."
Nahum,3,11,You also will become drunk; you will hide yourself. You also will seek refuge from the enemy.
Nahum,3,12,"All your fortresses are fig trees with figs that ripened first; when shaken, they fall— right into the mouth of the eater!"
Nahum,3,13,"Look, your troops are like women among you; the gates of your land are wide open to your enemies. Fire will devour the bars of your gates."
Nahum,3,14,Draw water for the siege; strengthen your fortresses. Step into the clay and tread the mortar; take hold of the brick-mold!
Nahum,3,15,"The fire will devour you there; the sword will cut you down. It will devour you like the young locust. Multiply yourselves like the young locust, multiply like the swarming locust!"
Nahum,3,16,You have made your merchants more numerous than the stars of the sky. The young locust strips the land and flies away.
Nahum,3,17,"Your court officials are like the swarming locust, and your scribes like clouds of locusts, which settle on the walls on a cold day; when the sun rises, they take off, and no one knows where they are."
Nahum,3,18,"King of Assyria, your shepherds slumber; your officers sleep. Your people are scattered across the mountains with no one to gather them together."
Nahum,3,19,"There is no remedy for your injury; your wound is severe. All who hear the news about you will clap their hands because of you, for who has not experienced your constant cruelty?"
Habakkuk,1,1,The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet saw.
Habakkuk,1,2,"How long, LORD, must I call for help and You do not listen or cry out to You about violence and You do not save?"
Habakkuk,1,3,"Why do You force me to look at injustice? Why do You tolerate wrongdoing? Oppression and violence are right in front of me. Strife is ongoing, and conflict escalates."
Habakkuk,1,4,"This is why the law is ineffective and justice never emerges. For the wicked restrict the righteous; therefore, justice comes out perverted."
Habakkuk,1,5,Look at the nations and observe— be utterly astounded! For something is taking place in your days that you will not believe when you hear about it.
Habakkuk,1,6,"Look! I am raising up the Chaldeans, that bitter, impetuous nation that marches across the earth’s open spaces to seize territories not its own."
Habakkuk,1,7,They are fierce and terrifying; their views of justice and sovereignty stem from themselves.
Habakkuk,1,8,"Their horses are swifter than leopards and more fierce than wolves of the night. Their horsemen charge ahead; their horsemen come from distant lands. They fly like an eagle, swooping to devour."
Habakkuk,1,9,All of them come to do violence; their faces are set in determination. They gather prisoners like sand.
Habakkuk,1,10,"They mock kings, and rulers are a joke to them. They laugh at every fortress and build siege ramps to capture it."
Habakkuk,1,11,Then they sweep by like the wind and pass through. They are guilty; their strength is their god.
Habakkuk,1,12,"Are You not from eternity, Yahweh my God? My Holy One, You will not die. LORD, You appointed them to execute judgment; my Rock, You destined them to punish us."
Habakkuk,1,13,"Your eyes are too pure to look on evil, and You cannot tolerate wrongdoing. So why do You tolerate those who are treacherous? Why are You silent while one who is wicked swallows up one who is more righteous than himself?"
Habakkuk,1,14,"You have made mankind like the fish of the sea, like marine creatures that have no ruler."
Habakkuk,1,15,"The Chaldeans pull them all up with a hook, catch them in their dragnet, and gather them in their fishing net; that is why they are glad and rejoice."
Habakkuk,1,16,"That is why they sacrifice to their dragnet and burn incense to their fishing net, for by these things their portion is rich and their food plentiful."
Habakkuk,1,17,Will they therefore empty their net and continually slaughter nations without mercy?
Habakkuk,2,1,I will stand at my guard post and station myself on the lookout tower. I will watch to see what He will say to me and what I should reply about my complaint.
Habakkuk,2,2,The LORD answered me: Write down this vision; clearly inscribe it on tablets so one may easily read it.
Habakkuk,2,3,"For the vision is yet for the appointed time; it testifies about the end and will not lie. Though it delays, wait for it, since it will certainly come and not be late."
Habakkuk,2,4,"Look, his ego is inflated; he is without integrity. But the righteous one will live by his faith."
Habakkuk,2,5,"Moreover, wine betrays; an arrogant man is never at rest. He enlarges his appetite like Sheol, and like Death he is never satisfied. He gathers all the nations to himself; he collects all the peoples for himself."
Habakkuk,2,6,"Won’t all of these take up a taunt against him, with mockery and riddles about him? They will say: Woe to him who amasses what is not his— how much longer?— and loads himself with goods taken in pledge."
Habakkuk,2,7,"Won’t your creditors suddenly arise, and those who disturb you wake up? Then you will become spoil for them."
Habakkuk,2,8,"Since you have plundered many nations, all the peoples who remain will plunder you— because of human bloodshed and violence against lands, cities, and all who live in them."
Habakkuk,2,9,"Woe to him who dishonestly makes wealth for his house to place his nest on high, to escape from the reach of disaster!"
Habakkuk,2,10,You have planned shame for your house by wiping out many peoples and sinning against your own self.
Habakkuk,2,11,"For the stones will cry out from the wall, and the rafters will answer them from the woodwork."
Habakkuk,2,12,Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed and founds a town with injustice!
Habakkuk,2,13,Is it not from the LORD of Hosts that the peoples labor only to fuel the fire and countries exhaust themselves for nothing?
Habakkuk,2,14,"For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the LORD’s glory, as the waters cover the sea."
Habakkuk,2,15,"Woe to him who gives his neighbors drink, pouring out your wrath and even making them drunk, in order to look at their nakedness!"
Habakkuk,2,16,"You will be filled with disgrace instead of glory. You also—drink, and expose your uncircumcision! The cup in the LORD’s right hand will come around to you, and utter disgrace will cover your glory."
Habakkuk,2,17,"For your violence against Lebanon will overwhelm you; the destruction of animals will terrify you because of your human bloodshed and violence against lands, cities, and all who live in them."
Habakkuk,2,18,"What use is a carved idol after its craftsman carves it? It is only a cast image, a teacher of lies. For the one who crafts its shape trusts in it and makes idols that cannot speak."
Habakkuk,2,19,"Woe to him who says to wood: Wake up! or to mute stone: Come alive! Can it teach? Look! It may be plated with gold and silver, yet there is no breath in it at all."
Habakkuk,2,20,But the LORD is in His holy temple; let everyone on earth be silent in His presence.
Habakkuk,3,1,A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet. According to Shigionoth.
Habakkuk,3,2,"LORD, I have heard the report about You; LORD, I stand in awe of Your deeds. Revive Your work in these years; make it known in these years. In Your wrath remember mercy!"
Habakkuk,3,3,"God comes from Teman, the Holy One from Mount Paran.Selah His splendor covers the heavens, and the earth is full of His praise."
Habakkuk,3,4,His brilliance is like light; rays are flashing from His hand. This is where His power is hidden.
Habakkuk,3,5,"Plague goes before Him, and pestilence follows in His steps."
Habakkuk,3,6,He stands and shakes the earth; He looks and startles the nations. The age-old mountains break apart; the ancient hills sink down. His pathways are ancient.
Habakkuk,3,7,I see the tents of Cushan in distress; the tent curtains of the land of Midian tremble.
Habakkuk,3,8,"Are You angry at the rivers, LORD? Is Your wrath against the rivers? Or is Your rage against the sea when You ride on Your horses, Your victorious chariot?"
Habakkuk,3,9,You took the sheath from Your bow; the arrows are ready to be used with an oath.Selah You split the earth with rivers.
Habakkuk,3,10,The mountains see You and shudder; a downpour of water sweeps by. The deep roars with its voice and lifts its waves high.
Habakkuk,3,11,"Sun and moon stand still in their lofty residence, at the flash of Your flying arrows, at the brightness of Your shining spear."
Habakkuk,3,12,You march across the earth with indignation; You trample down the nations in wrath.
Habakkuk,3,13,"You come out to save Your people, to save Your anointed. You crush the leader of the house of the wicked and strip him from foot to neck.Selah"
Habakkuk,3,14,"You pierce his head with his own spears; his warriors storm out to scatter us, gloating as if ready to secretly devour the weak."
Habakkuk,3,15,"You tread the sea with Your horses, stirring up the great waters."
Habakkuk,3,16,"I heard, and I trembled within; my lips quivered at the sound. Rottenness entered my bones; I trembled where I stood. Now I must quietly wait for the day of distress to come against the people invading us."
Habakkuk,3,17,"Though the fig tree does not bud and there is no fruit on the vines, though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food, though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls,"
Habakkuk,3,18,yet I will triumph in Yahweh; I will rejoice in the God of my salvation!
Habakkuk,3,19,Yahweh my Lord is my strength; He makes my feet like those of a deer and enables me to walk on mountain heights! For the choir director: on stringed instruments.
Zephaniah,1,1,"The word of the LORD that came to Zephaniah son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah."
Zephaniah,1,2,I will completely sweep away everything from the face of the earth— this is the LORD’s declaration.
Zephaniah,1,3,"I will sweep away man and animal; I will sweep away the birds of the sky and the fish of the sea, and the ruins along with the wicked. I will cut off mankind from the face of the earth. This is the LORD’s declaration."
Zephaniah,1,4,"I will stretch out My hand against Judah and against all the residents of Jerusalem. I will cut off every vestige of Baal from this place, the names of the pagan priests along with the priests;"
Zephaniah,1,5,those who bow in worship on the rooftops to the heavenly host; those who bow and pledge loyalty to the LORD but also pledge loyalty to Milcom;
Zephaniah,1,6,"and those who turn back from following the LORD, who do not seek the LORD or inquire of Him."
Zephaniah,1,7,"Be silent in the presence of the Lord GOD, for the Day of the LORD is near. Indeed, the LORD has prepared a sacrifice; He has consecrated His guests."
Zephaniah,1,8,"On the day of the LORD’s sacrifice I will punish the officials, the king’s sons, and all who are dressed in foreign clothing."
Zephaniah,1,9,"On that day I will punish all who skip over the threshold, who fill their master’s house with violence and deceit."
Zephaniah,1,10,"On that day— this is the LORD’s declaration— there will be an outcry from the Fish Gate, a wailing from the Second District, and a loud crashing from the hills."
Zephaniah,1,11,"Wail, you residents of the Hollow, for all the merchants will be silenced; all those loaded with silver will be cut off."
Zephaniah,1,12,"And at that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps and punish the men who settle down comfortably, who say to themselves: The LORD will not do good or evil."
Zephaniah,1,13,"Their wealth will become plunder and their houses a ruin. They will build houses but never live in them, plant vineyards but never drink their wine."
Zephaniah,1,14,"The great Day of the LORD is near, near and rapidly approaching. Listen, the Day of the LORD— then the warrior’s cry is bitter."
Zephaniah,1,15,"That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of destruction and desolation, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness,"
Zephaniah,1,16,"a day of trumpet blast and battle cry against the fortified cities, and against the high corner towers."
Zephaniah,1,17,"I will bring distress on mankind, and they will walk like the blind because they have sinned against the LORD. Their blood will be poured out like dust and their flesh like dung."
Zephaniah,1,18,"Their silver and their gold will not be able to rescue them on the day of the LORD’s wrath. The whole earth will be consumed by the fire of His jealousy. For He will make a complete, yes, a horrifying end of all the inhabitants of the earth."
Zephaniah,2,1,"Gather yourselves together; gather together, undesirable nation,"
Zephaniah,2,2,"before the decree takes effect and the day passes like chaff, before the burning of the LORD’s anger overtakes you, before the day of the LORD’s anger overtakes you."
Zephaniah,2,3,"Seek the LORD, all you humble of the earth, who carry out what He commands. Seek righteousness, seek humility; perhaps you will be concealed on the day of the LORD’s anger."
Zephaniah,2,4,"For Gaza will be abandoned, and Ashkelon will become a ruin. Ashdod will be driven out at noon, and Ekron will be uprooted."
Zephaniah,2,5,"Woe, inhabitants of the seacoast, nation of the Cherethites! The word of the LORD is against you, Canaan, land of the Philistines: I will destroy you until there is no one left."
Zephaniah,2,6,The seacoast will become pasturelands with caves for shepherds and folds for sheep.
Zephaniah,2,7,"The coastland will belong to the remnant of the house of Judah; they will find pasture there. They will lie down in the evening among the houses of Ashkelon, for the LORD their God will return to them and restore their fortunes."
Zephaniah,2,8,"I have heard the taunting of Moab and the insults of the Ammonites, who have taunted My people and threatened their territory."
Zephaniah,2,9,"Therefore, as I live— this is the declaration of the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel— Moab will be like Sodom and the Ammonites like Gomorrah— a place overgrown with weeds, a salt pit, and a perpetual wasteland. The remnant of My people will plunder them; the remainder of My nation will dispossess them."
Zephaniah,2,10,"This is what they get for their pride, because they have taunted and acted arrogantly against the people of the LORD of Hosts."
Zephaniah,2,11,"The LORD will be terrifying to them when He starves all the gods of the earth. Then all the distant coastlands of the nations will bow in worship to Him, each in its own place."
Zephaniah,2,12,You Cushites will also be slain by My sword.
Zephaniah,2,13,"He will also stretch out His hand against the north and destroy Assyria; He will make Nineveh a desolate ruin, dry as the desert."
Zephaniah,2,14,"Herds will lie down in the middle of it, every kind of wild animal. Both the desert owl and the screech owl will roost in the capitals of its pillars. Their calls will sound from the window, but devastation will be on the threshold, for He will expose the cedar work."
Zephaniah,2,15,"This is the self-assured city that lives in security, that thinks to herself: I exist, and there is no one else. What a desolation she has become, a place for wild animals to lie down! Everyone who passes by her jeers and shakes his fist."
Zephaniah,3,1,"Woe to the city that is rebellious and defiled, the oppressive city!"
Zephaniah,3,2,She has not obeyed; she has not accepted discipline. She has not trusted in Yahweh; she has not drawn near to her God.
Zephaniah,3,3,"The princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are wolves of the night, which leave nothing for the morning."
Zephaniah,3,4,Her prophets are reckless— treacherous men. Her priests profane the sanctuary; they do violence to instruction.
Zephaniah,3,5,"The righteous LORD is in her; He does no wrong. He applies His justice morning by morning; He does not fail at dawn, yet the one who does wrong knows no shame."
Zephaniah,3,6,"I have cut off nations; their corner towers are destroyed. I have laid waste their streets, with no one to pass through. Their cities lie devastated, without a person, without an inhabitant."
Zephaniah,3,7,"I thought: You will certainly fear Me and accept correction. Then her dwelling place would not be cut off based on all that I had allocated to her. However, they became more corrupt in all their actions."
Zephaniah,3,8,"Therefore, wait for Me— this is the LORD’s declaration— until the day I rise up for plunder. For My decision is to gather nations, to assemble kingdoms, in order to pour out My indignation on them, all My burning anger; for the whole earth will be consumed by the fire of My jealousy."
Zephaniah,3,9,For I will then restore pure speech to the peoples so that all of them may call on the name of Yahweh and serve Him with a single purpose.
Zephaniah,3,10,"From beyond the rivers of Cush My supplicants, My dispersed people, will bring an offering to Me."
Zephaniah,3,11,"On that day you will not be put to shame because of everything you have done in rebelling against Me. For then I will remove your proud, arrogant people from among you, and you will never again be haughty on My holy mountain."
Zephaniah,3,12,"I will leave a meek and humble people among you, and they will take refuge in the name of Yahweh."
Zephaniah,3,13,"The remnant of Israel will no longer do wrong or tell lies; a deceitful tongue will not be found in their mouths. But they will pasture and lie down, with nothing to make them afraid."
Zephaniah,3,14,"Sing for joy, Daughter Zion; shout loudly, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, Daughter Jerusalem!"
Zephaniah,3,15,"The LORD has removed your punishment; He has turned back your enemy. The King of Israel, Yahweh, is among you; you need no longer fear harm."
Zephaniah,3,16,"On that day it will be said to Jerusalem: “Do not fear; Zion, do not let your hands grow weak."
Zephaniah,3,17,"Yahweh your God is among you, a warrior who saves. He will rejoice over you with gladness. He will bring you quietness with His love. He will delight in you with shouts of joy.”"
Zephaniah,3,18,I will gather those who have been driven from the appointed festivals; they will be a tribute from you and a reproach on her.
Zephaniah,3,19,"Yes, at that time I will deal with all who afflict you. I will save the lame and gather the scattered; I will make those who were disgraced throughout the earth receive praise and fame."
Zephaniah,3,20,"At that time I will bring you back, yes, at the time I will gather you. I will give you fame and praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes. Yahweh has spoken."
Haggai,1,1,"In the second year of King Darius, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of the LORD came through Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, the governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest:"
Haggai,1,2,“The LORD of Hosts says this: These people say: The time has not come for the house of the LORD to be rebuilt.”
Haggai,1,3,The word of the LORD came through Haggai the prophet:
Haggai,1,4,"“Is it a time for you yourselves to live in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins?”"
Haggai,1,5,"Now, the LORD of Hosts says this: “Think carefully about your ways:"
Haggai,1,6,You have planted much but harvested little. You eat but never have enough to be satisfied. You drink but never have enough to become drunk. You put on clothes but never have enough to get warm. The wage earner puts his wages into a bag with a hole in it.”
Haggai,1,7,The LORD of Hosts says this: “Think carefully about your ways.
Haggai,1,8,"Go up into the hills, bring down lumber, and build the house. Then I will be pleased with it and be glorified,” says the LORD."
Haggai,1,9,"“You expected much, but then it amounted to little. When you brought the harvest to your house, I ruined it. Why?” This is the declaration of the LORD of Hosts. “Because My house still lies in ruins, while each of you is busy with his own house."
Haggai,1,10,"So on your account, the skies have withheld the dew and the land its crops."
Haggai,1,11,"I have summoned a drought on the fields and the hills, on the grain, new wine, olive oil, and whatever the ground yields, on man and beast, and on all that your hands produce.”"
Haggai,1,12,"Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak, and the entire remnant of the people obeyed the voice of the LORD their God and the words of the prophet Haggai, because the LORD their God had sent him. So the people feared the LORD."
Haggai,1,13,"Haggai, the LORD’s messenger, delivered the LORD’s message to the people, “I am with you”—this is the LORD’s declaration."
Haggai,1,14,"The LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, the spirit of the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people. They began work on the house of Yahweh of Hosts, their God,"
Haggai,1,15,"on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of King Darius."
Haggai,2,1,"On the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of the LORD came through Haggai the prophet:"
Haggai,2,2,"“Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, to the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak, and to the remnant of the people:"
Haggai,2,3,Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Doesn’t it seem like nothing to you?
Haggai,2,4,"Even so, be strong, Zerubbabel”—this is the LORD’s declaration. “Be strong, Joshua son of Jehozadak, high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land”—this is the LORD’s declaration. “Work! For I am with you”—the declaration of the LORD of Hosts."
Haggai,2,5,"“This is the promise I made to you when you came out of Egypt, and My Spirit is present among you; don’t be afraid.”"
Haggai,2,6,"For the LORD of Hosts says this: “Once more, in a little while, I am going to shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land."
Haggai,2,7,"I will shake all the nations so that the treasures of all the nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory,” says the LORD of Hosts."
Haggai,2,8,“The silver and gold belong to Me”—this is the declaration of the LORD of Hosts.
Haggai,2,9,"“The final glory of this house will be greater than the first,” says the LORD of Hosts. “I will provide peace in this place”—this is the declaration of the LORD of Hosts."
Haggai,2,10,"On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Haggai the prophet:"
Haggai,2,11,“This is what the LORD of Hosts says: Ask the priests for a ruling.
Haggai,2,12,"If a man is carrying consecrated meat in the fold of his garment, and it touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any other food, does it become holy?” The priests answered, “No.”"
Haggai,2,13,"Then Haggai asked, “If someone defiled by contact with a corpse touches any of these, does it become defiled?” The priests answered, “It becomes defiled.”"
Haggai,2,14,"Then Haggai replied, “So is this people, and so is this nation before Me”—this is the LORD’s declaration. “And so is every work of their hands; even what they offer there is defiled."
Haggai,2,15,"“Now, reflect back from this day: Before one stone was placed on another in the LORD’s temple,"
Haggai,2,16,"what state were you in? When someone came to a grain heap of 20 measures, it only amounted to 10; when one came to the winepress to dip 50 measures from the vat, it only amounted to 20."
Haggai,2,17,"I struck you—all the work of your hands—with blight, mildew, and hail, but you didn’t turn to Me”—this is the LORD’s declaration."
Haggai,2,18,"“Consider carefully from this day forward; from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, from the day the foundation of the LORD’s temple was laid; consider it carefully."
Haggai,2,19,"Is there still seed left in the granary? The vine, the fig, the pomegranate, and the olive tree have not yet produced. But from this day on I will bless you.”"
Haggai,2,20,The word of the LORD came to Haggai a second time on the twenty-fourth day of the month:
Haggai,2,21,"“Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah: I am going to shake the heavens and the earth."
Haggai,2,22,"I will overturn royal thrones and destroy the power of the Gentile kingdoms. I will overturn chariots and their riders. Horses and their riders will fall, each by his brother’s sword."
Haggai,2,23,"On that day”—this is the declaration of the LORD of Hosts—“I will take you, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, My servant”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“and make you like My signet ring, for I have chosen you.” This is the declaration of the LORD of Hosts."
Zechariah,1,1,"In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berechiah, son of Iddo:"
Zechariah,1,2,“The LORD was extremely angry with your ancestors.
Zechariah,1,3,"So tell the people: This is what the LORD of Hosts says: Return to Me”—this is the declaration of the LORD of Hosts—“and I will return to you, says the LORD of Hosts."
Zechariah,1,4,Do not be like your ancestors; the earlier prophets proclaimed to them: This is what the LORD of Hosts says: Turn from your evil ways and your evil deeds. But they did not listen or pay attention to Me”—this is the LORD’s declaration.
Zechariah,1,5,“Where are your ancestors now? And do the prophets live forever?
Zechariah,1,6,"But didn’t My words and My statutes that I commanded My servants the prophets overtake your ancestors? They repented and said: As the LORD of Hosts purposed to deal with us for our ways and deeds, so He has dealt with us.”"
Zechariah,1,7,"On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berechiah, son of Iddo:"
Zechariah,1,8,"I looked out in the night and saw a man riding on a red horse. He was standing among the myrtle trees in the valley. Behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses."
Zechariah,1,9,"I asked, “What are these, my lord?” The angel who was talking to me replied, “I will show you what they are.”"
Zechariah,1,10,"Then the man standing among the myrtle trees explained, “They are the ones the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.”"
Zechariah,1,11,"They reported to the Angel of the LORD standing among the myrtle trees, “We have patrolled the earth, and right now the whole earth is calm and quiet.”"
Zechariah,1,12,"Then the Angel of the LORD responded, “How long, LORD of Hosts, will You withhold mercy from Jerusalem and the cities of Judah that You have been angry with these 70 years?”"
Zechariah,1,13,The LORD replied with kind and comforting words to the angel who was speaking with me.
Zechariah,1,14,"So the angel who was speaking with me said, “Proclaim: The LORD of Hosts says: I am extremely jealous for Jerusalem and Zion."
Zechariah,1,15,"I am fiercely angry with the nations that are at ease, for I was a little angry, but they made it worse."
Zechariah,1,16,"Therefore, this is what the LORD says: In mercy, I have returned to Jerusalem; My house will be rebuilt within it”—this is the declaration of the LORD of Hosts—“and a measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem."
Zechariah,1,17,“Proclaim further: This is what the LORD of Hosts says: My cities will again overflow with prosperity; the LORD will once more comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.”
Zechariah,1,18,Then I looked up and saw four horns.
Zechariah,1,19,"So I asked the angel who was speaking with me, “What are these?” And he said to me, “These are the horns that scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”"
Zechariah,1,20,Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen.
Zechariah,1,21,"I asked, “What are they coming to do?” He replied, “These are the horns that scattered Judah so no one could raise his head. These craftsmen have come to terrify them, to cut off the horns of the nations that raised their horns against the land of Judah to scatter it.”"
Zechariah,2,1,I looked up and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand.
Zechariah,2,2,"I asked, “Where are you going?” He answered me, “To measure Jerusalem to determine its width and length.”"
Zechariah,2,3,"Then the angel who was speaking with me went out, and another angel went out to meet him."
Zechariah,2,4,"He said to him, “Run and tell this young man: Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the number of people and livestock in it.”"
Zechariah,2,5,"The declaration of the LORD: “I will be a wall of fire around it, and I will be the glory within it.”"
Zechariah,2,6,“Get up! Leave the land of the north”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“for I have scattered you like the four winds of heaven”—this is the LORD’s declaration.
Zechariah,2,7,"“Go, Zion! Escape, you who are living with Daughter Babylon.”"
Zechariah,2,8,"For the LORD of Hosts says this: “He has sent Me for His glory against the nations who are plundering you, for anyone who touches you touches the pupil of His eye."
Zechariah,2,9,"I will move against them with My power, and they will become plunder for their own servants. Then you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent Me."
Zechariah,2,10,"“Daughter Zion, shout for joy and be glad, for I am coming to dwell among you”—this is the LORD’s declaration."
Zechariah,2,11,"“Many nations will join themselves to the LORD on that day and become My people. I will dwell among you, and you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent Me to you."
Zechariah,2,12,"The LORD will take possession of Judah as His portion in the Holy Land, and He will once again choose Jerusalem."
Zechariah,2,13,"Let all people be silent before the LORD, for He is coming from His holy dwelling.”"
Zechariah,3,1,"Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of the LORD, with Satan standing at his right side to accuse him."
Zechariah,3,2,"The LORD said to Satan: “The LORD rebuke you, Satan! May the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Isn’t this man a burning stick snatched from the fire?”"
Zechariah,3,3,Now Joshua was dressed with filthy clothes as he stood before the Angel.
Zechariah,3,4,"So the Angel of the LORD spoke to those standing before Him, “Take off his filthy clothes!” Then He said to him, “See, I have removed your guilt from you, and I will clothe you with splendid robes.”"
Zechariah,3,5,"Then I said, “Let them put a clean turban on his head.” So a clean turban was placed on his head, and they clothed him in garments while the Angel of the LORD was standing nearby."
Zechariah,3,6,Then the Angel of the LORD charged Joshua:
Zechariah,3,7,"“This is what the LORD of Hosts says: If you walk in My ways and keep My instructions, you will both rule My house and take care of My courts; I will also grant you access among these who are standing here."
Zechariah,3,8,"“Listen, Joshua the high priest, you and your colleagues sitting before you; indeed, these men are a sign that I am about to bring My servant, the Branch."
Zechariah,3,9,Notice the stone I have set before Joshua; on that one stone are seven eyes. I will engrave an inscription on it”—this is the declaration of the LORD of Hosts—“and I will take away the guilt of this land in a single day.
Zechariah,3,10,"On that day, each of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and fig tree.” This is the declaration of the LORD of Hosts."
Zechariah,4,1,The angel who was speaking with me then returned and roused me as one awakened out of sleep.
Zechariah,4,2,"He asked me, “What do you see?” I replied, “I see a solid gold lampstand there with a bowl on its top. It has seven lamps on it and seven channels for each of the lamps on its top."
Zechariah,4,3,"There are also two olive trees beside it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.”"
Zechariah,4,4,"Then I asked the angel who was speaking with me, “What are these, my lord?”"
Zechariah,4,5,"“Don’t you know what they are?” replied the angel who was speaking with me. I said, “No, my lord.”"
Zechariah,4,6,"So he answered me, “This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel: ‘Not by strength or by might, but by My Spirit,’ says the LORD of Hosts."
Zechariah,4,7,"‘What are you, great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain. And he will bring out the capstone accompanied by shouts of: Grace, grace to it!’”"
Zechariah,4,8,Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Zechariah,4,9,"“Zerubbabel’s hands have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will complete it. Then you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent me to you."
Zechariah,4,10,"For who scorns the day of small things? These seven eyes of the LORD, which scan throughout the whole earth, will rejoice when they see the plumb line in Zerubbabel’s hand.”"
Zechariah,4,11,"I asked him, “What are the two olive trees on the right and left of the lampstand?”"
Zechariah,4,12,"And I questioned him further, “What are the two olive branches beside the two gold conduits, from which golden oil pours out?”"
Zechariah,4,13,"Then he inquired of me, “Don’t you know what these are?” “No, my lord,” I replied."
Zechariah,4,14,"“These are the two anointed ones,” he said, “who stand by the Lord of the whole earth.”"
Zechariah,5,1,I looked up again and saw a flying scroll.
Zechariah,5,2,"“What do you see?” he asked me. “I see a flying scroll,” I replied, “30 feet long and 15 feet wide.”"
Zechariah,5,3,"Then he said to me, “This is the curse that is going out over the whole land, for every thief will be removed according to what is written on one side, and everyone who swears falsely will be removed according to what is written on the other side."
Zechariah,5,4,"I will send it out,”—this is the declaration of the LORD of Hosts—“and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name. It will stay inside his house and destroy it along with its timbers and stones.”"
Zechariah,5,5,"Then the angel who was speaking with me came forward and told me, “Look up and see what this is that is approaching.”"
Zechariah,5,6,"So I asked, “What is it?” He responded, “It’s a measuring basket that is approaching.” And he continued, “This is their iniquity in all the land.”"
Zechariah,5,7,"Then a lead cover was lifted, and there was a woman sitting inside the basket."
Zechariah,5,8,"“This is Wickedness,” he said. He shoved her down into the basket and pushed the lead weight over its opening."
Zechariah,5,9,"Then I looked up and saw two women approaching with the wind in their wings. Their wings were like those of a stork, and they lifted up the basket between earth and sky."
Zechariah,5,10,"So I asked the angel who was speaking with me, “Where are they taking the basket?”"
Zechariah,5,11,"“To build a shrine for it in the land of Shinar,” he told me. “When that is ready, the basket will be placed there on its pedestal.”"
Zechariah,6,1,Then I looked up again and saw four chariots coming from between two mountains. And the mountains were made of bronze.
Zechariah,6,2,"The first chariot had red horses, the second chariot black horses,"
Zechariah,6,3,"the third chariot white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses—all strong horses."
Zechariah,6,4,"So I inquired of the angel who was speaking with me, “What are these, my lord?”"
Zechariah,6,5,"The angel told me, “These are the four spirits of heaven going out after presenting themselves to the Lord of the whole earth."
Zechariah,6,6,"The one with the black horses is going to the land of the north, the white horses are going after them, but the dappled horses are going to the land of the south.”"
Zechariah,6,7,"As the strong horses went out, they wanted to go patrol the earth, and the LORD said, “Go, patrol the earth.” So they patrolled the earth."
Zechariah,6,8,"Then He summoned me saying, “See, those going to the land of the north have pacified My Spirit in the northern land.”"
Zechariah,6,9,The word of the LORD came to me:
Zechariah,6,10,"“Take an offering from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon, and go that same day to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah."
Zechariah,6,11,"Take silver and gold, make crowns and place them on the head of Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest."
Zechariah,6,12,You are to tell him: This is what the LORD of Hosts says: Here is a man whose name is Branch; He will branch out from His place and build the LORD’s temple.
Zechariah,6,13,"Yes, He will build the LORD’s temple; He will be clothed in splendor and will sit on His throne and rule. There will also be a priest on His throne, and there will be peaceful counsel between the two of them."
Zechariah,6,14,"The crown will reside in the LORD’s temple as a memorial to Heldai, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Hen son of Zephaniah."
Zechariah,6,15,"People who are far off will come and build the LORD’s temple, and you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent Me to you. This will happen when you fully obey the LORD your God.”"
Zechariah,7,1,"In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev."
Zechariah,7,2,"Now the people of Bethel had sent Sharezer, Regem-melech, and their men to plead for the LORD’s favor"
Zechariah,7,3,"by asking the priests who were at the house of the LORD of Hosts as well as the prophets, “Should we mourn and fast in the fifth month as we have done these many years?”"
Zechariah,7,4,Then the word of the LORD of Hosts came to me:
Zechariah,7,5,"“Ask all the people of the land and the priests: When you fasted and lamented in the fifth and in the seventh months for these 70 years, did you really fast for Me?"
Zechariah,7,6,"When you eat and drink, don’t you eat and drink simply for yourselves?"
Zechariah,7,7,"Aren’t these the words that the LORD proclaimed through the earlier prophets when Jerusalem was inhabited and secure, along with its surrounding cities, and when the southern region and the Judean foothills were inhabited?”"
Zechariah,7,8,The word of the LORD came to Zechariah:
Zechariah,7,9,“The LORD of Hosts says this: Make fair decisions. Show faithful love and compassion to one another.
Zechariah,7,10,"Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the foreigner or the poor, and do not plot evil in your hearts against one another."
Zechariah,7,11,But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder; they closed their ears so they could not hear.
Zechariah,7,12,They made their hearts like a rock so as not to obey the law or the words that the LORD of Hosts had sent by His Spirit through the earlier prophets. Therefore great anger came from the LORD of Hosts.
Zechariah,7,13,"Just as He had called, and they would not listen, so when they called, I would not listen,” says the LORD of Hosts."
Zechariah,7,14,"“I scattered them with a windstorm over all the nations that had not known them, and the land was left desolate behind them, with no one coming or going. They turned a pleasant land into a desolation.”"
Zechariah,8,1,The word of the LORD of Hosts came:
Zechariah,8,2,“The LORD of Hosts says this: I am extremely jealous for Zion; I am jealous for her with great wrath.”
Zechariah,8,3,"The LORD says this: “I will return to Zion and live in Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the Faithful City, the mountain of the LORD of Hosts, and the Holy Mountain.”"
Zechariah,8,4,"The LORD of Hosts says this: “Old men and women will again sit along the streets of Jerusalem, each with a staff in hand because of advanced age."
Zechariah,8,5,The streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in them.”
Zechariah,8,6,"The LORD of Hosts says this: “Though it may seem incredible to the remnant of this people in those days, should it also seem incredible to Me?”—this is the declaration of the LORD of Hosts."
Zechariah,8,7,The LORD of Hosts says this: “I will save My people from the land of the east and the land of the west.
Zechariah,8,8,"I will bring them back to live in Jerusalem. They will be My people, and I will be their faithful and righteous God.”"
Zechariah,8,9,"The LORD of Hosts says this: “Let your hands be strong, you who now hear these words that the prophets spoke when the foundations were laid for the rebuilding of the temple, the house of the LORD of Hosts."
Zechariah,8,10,"For prior to those days neither man nor beast had wages. There was no safety from the enemy for anyone who came or went, for I turned everyone against his neighbor."
Zechariah,8,11,"But now, I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days”—this is the declaration of the LORD of Hosts."
Zechariah,8,12,"“For they will sow in peace: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce, and the skies will yield their dew. I will give the remnant of this people all these things as an inheritance."
Zechariah,8,13,"As you have been a curse among the nations, house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you, and you will be a blessing. Don’t be afraid; let your hands be strong.”"
Zechariah,8,14,"For the LORD of Hosts says this: “As I resolved to treat you badly when your fathers provoked Me to anger, and I did not relent,” says the LORD of Hosts,"
Zechariah,8,15,“so I have resolved again in these days to do what is good to Jerusalem and the house of Judah. Don’t be afraid.
Zechariah,8,16,These are the things you must do: Speak truth to one another; make true and sound decisions within your gates.
Zechariah,8,17,"Do not plot evil in your hearts against your neighbor, and do not love perjury, for I hate all this”—this is the LORD’s declaration."
Zechariah,8,18,Then the word of the LORD of Hosts came to me:
Zechariah,8,19,"“The LORD of Hosts says this: The fast of the fourth month, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth will become times of joy, gladness, and cheerful festivals for the house of Judah. Therefore, love truth and peace.”"
Zechariah,8,20,"The LORD of Hosts says this: “Peoples will yet come, the residents of many cities;"
Zechariah,8,21,"the residents of one city will go to another, saying: Let’s go at once to plead for the LORD’s favor and to seek the LORD of Hosts. I am also going."
Zechariah,8,22,Many peoples and strong nations will come to seek the LORD of Hosts in Jerusalem and to plead for the LORD’s favor.”
Zechariah,8,23,"The LORD of Hosts says this: “In those days, 10 men from nations of every language will grab the robe of a Jewish man tightly, urging: Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.”"
Zechariah,9,1,"An Oracle The word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach, and Damascus is its resting place— for the eyes of men and all the tribes of Israel are on the LORD—"
Zechariah,9,2,"and also against Hamath, which borders it, as well as Tyre and Sidon, though they are very shrewd."
Zechariah,9,3,Tyre has built herself a fortress; she has heaped up silver like dust and gold like the dirt of the streets.
Zechariah,9,4,Listen! The Lord will impoverish her and cast her wealth into the sea; she herself will be consumed by fire.
Zechariah,9,5,"Ashkelon will see it and be afraid; Gaza too, and will writhe in great pain, as will Ekron, for her hope will fail. There will cease to be a king in Gaza, and Ashkelon will become uninhabited."
Zechariah,9,6,"A mongrel people will live in Ashdod, and I will destroy the pride of the Philistines."
Zechariah,9,7,I will remove the blood from their mouths and the detestable things from between their teeth. Then they too will become a remnant for our God; they will become like a clan in Judah and Ekron like the Jebusites.
Zechariah,9,8,"I will set up camp at My house against an army, against those who march back and forth, and no oppressor will march against them again, for now I have seen with My own eyes."
Zechariah,9,9,"Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion! Shout in triumph, Daughter Jerusalem! Look, your King is coming to you; He is righteous and victorious, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
Zechariah,9,10,"I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem. The bow of war will be removed, and He will proclaim peace to the nations. His dominion will extend from sea to sea, from the Euphrates River to the ends of the earth."
Zechariah,9,11,"As for you, because of the blood of your covenant, I will release your prisoners from the waterless cistern."
Zechariah,9,12,"Return to a stronghold, you prisoners who have hope; today I declare that I will restore double to you."
Zechariah,9,13,"For I will bend Judah as My bow; I will fill that bow with Ephraim. I will rouse your sons, Zion, against your sons, Greece. I will make you like a warrior’s sword."
Zechariah,9,14,"Then the LORD will appear over them, and His arrow will fly like lightning. The Lord GOD will sound the trumpet and advance with the southern storms."
Zechariah,9,15,"The LORD of Hosts will defend them. They will consume and conquer with slingstones; they will drink and be rowdy as if with wine. They will be as full as the sprinkling basin, like those at the corners of the altar."
Zechariah,9,16,"The LORD their God will save them on that day as the flock of His people; for they are like jewels in a crown, sparkling over His land."
Zechariah,9,17,"How lovely and beautiful they will be! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine, the young women."
Zechariah,10,1,"Ask the LORD for rain in the season of spring rain. The LORD makes the rain clouds, and He will give them showers of rain and crops in the field for everyone."
Zechariah,10,2,"For the idols speak falsehood, and the diviners see illusions; they relate empty dreams and offer empty comfort. Therefore the people wander like sheep; they suffer affliction because there is no shepherd."
Zechariah,10,3,"My anger burns against the shepherds, so I will punish the leaders. For the LORD of Hosts has tended His flock, the house of Judah; He will make them like His majestic steed in battle."
Zechariah,10,4,The cornerstone will come from Judah. The tent peg will come from them and also the battle bow and every ruler. Together
Zechariah,10,5,"they will be like warriors in battle trampling down the mud of the streets. They will fight because the LORD is with them, and they will put horsemen to shame."
Zechariah,10,6,"I will strengthen the house of Judah and deliver the house of Joseph. I will restore them because I have compassion on them, and they will be as though I had never rejected them. For I am Yahweh their God, and I will answer them."
Zechariah,10,7,"Ephraim will be like a warrior, and their hearts will be glad as if with wine. Their children will see it and be glad; their hearts will rejoice in Yahweh."
Zechariah,10,8,I will whistle and gather them because I have redeemed them; they will be as numerous as they once were.
Zechariah,10,9,"Though I sow them among the nations, they will remember Me in the distant lands; they and their children will live and return."
Zechariah,10,10,"I will bring them back from the land of Egypt and gather them from Assyria. I will bring them to the land of Gilead and to Lebanon, but it will not be enough for them."
Zechariah,10,11,"Yahweh will pass through the sea of distress and strike the waves of the sea; all the depths of the Nile will dry up. The pride of Assyria will be brought down, and the scepter of Egypt will come to an end."
Zechariah,10,12,"I will strengthen them in Yahweh, and they will march in His name— this is Yahweh’s declaration."
Zechariah,11,1,"Open your gates, Lebanon, and fire will consume your cedars."
Zechariah,11,2,"Wail, cypress, for the cedar has fallen; the glorious trees are destroyed! Wail, oaks of Bashan, for the stately forest has fallen!"
Zechariah,11,3,"Listen to the wail of the shepherds, for their glory is destroyed. Listen to the roar of young lions, for the thickets of the Jordan are destroyed."
Zechariah,11,4,Yahweh my God says this: “Shepherd the flock intended for slaughter.
Zechariah,11,5,Those who buy them slaughter them but are not punished. Those who sell them say: Praise the LORD because I have become rich! Even their own shepherds have no compassion for them.
Zechariah,11,6,"Indeed, I will no longer have compassion on the inhabitants of the land”—this is the LORD’s declaration. “Instead, I will turn everyone over to his neighbor and his king. They will devastate the land, and I will not deliver it from them.”"
Zechariah,11,7,"So I shepherded the flock intended for slaughter, the afflicted of the flock. I took two staffs, calling one Favor and the other Union, and I shepherded the flock."
Zechariah,11,8,"In one month I got rid of three shepherds. I became impatient with them, and they also detested me."
Zechariah,11,9,"Then I said, “I will no longer shepherd you. Let what is dying die, and let what is going astray go astray; let the rest devour each other’s flesh.”"
Zechariah,11,10,"Next I took my staff called Favor and cut it in two, annulling the covenant I had made with all the peoples."
Zechariah,11,11,"It was annulled on that day, and so the afflicted of the flock who were watching me knew that it was the word of the LORD."
Zechariah,11,12,"Then I said to them, “If it seems right to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them.” So they weighed my wages, 30 pieces of silver."
Zechariah,11,13,"“Throw it to the potter,” the LORD said to me—this magnificent price I was valued by them. So I took the 30 pieces of silver and threw it into the house of the LORD, to the potter."
Zechariah,11,14,"Then I cut in two my second staff, Union, annulling the brotherhood between Judah and Israel."
Zechariah,11,15,The LORD also said to me: “Take the equipment of a foolish shepherd.
Zechariah,11,16,"I am about to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for those who are going astray, and he will not seek the lost or heal the broken. He will not sustain the healthy, but he will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hooves."
Zechariah,11,17,Woe to the worthless shepherd who deserts the flock! May a sword strike his arm and his right eye! May his arm wither away and his right eye go completely blind!”
Zechariah,12,1,"An Oracle The word of the LORD concerning Israel. A declaration of the LORD, who stretched out the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him."
Zechariah,12,2,"“Look, I will make Jerusalem a cup that causes staggering for the peoples who surround the city. The siege against Jerusalem will also involve Judah."
Zechariah,12,3,On that day I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who try to lift it will injure themselves severely when all the nations of the earth gather against her.
Zechariah,12,4,On that day”—this is the LORD’s declaration—“I will strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness. I will keep a watchful eye on the house of Judah but strike all the horses of the nations with blindness.
Zechariah,12,5,"Then each of the leaders of Judah will think to himself: The residents of Jerusalem are my strength through the LORD of Hosts, their God."
Zechariah,12,6,"On that day I will make the leaders of Judah like a firepot in a woodpile, like a flaming torch among sheaves; they will consume all the peoples around them on the right and the left, while Jerusalem continues to be inhabited on its site, in Jerusalem."
Zechariah,12,7,"The LORD will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of David’s house and the glory of Jerusalem’s residents may not be greater than that of Judah."
Zechariah,12,8,"On that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that on that day the one who is weakest among them will be like David on that day, and the house of David will be like God, like the Angel of the LORD, before them."
Zechariah,12,9,On that day I will set out to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
Zechariah,12,10,"“Then I will pour out a spirit of grace and prayer on the house of David and the residents of Jerusalem, and they will look at Me whom they pierced. They will mourn for Him as one mourns for an only child and weep bitterly for Him as one weeps for a firstborn."
Zechariah,12,11,On that day the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning of Hadad-rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
Zechariah,12,12,"The land will mourn, every family by itself: the family of David’s house by itself and their women by themselves; the family of Nathan’s house by itself and their women by themselves;"
Zechariah,12,13,the family of Levi’s house by itself and their women by themselves; the family of Shimei by itself and their women by themselves;
Zechariah,12,14,"all the remaining families, every family by itself, and their women by themselves."
Zechariah,13,1,"“On that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the residents of Jerusalem, to wash away sin and impurity."
Zechariah,13,2,"On that day”—this is the declaration of the LORD of Hosts—“I will erase the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered. I will remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land."
Zechariah,13,3,"If a man still prophesies, his father and his mother who bore him will say to him: You cannot remain alive because you have spoken falsely in the name of Yahweh. When he prophesies, his father and his mother who bore him will pierce him through."
Zechariah,13,4,On that day every prophet will be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies; they will not put on a hairy cloak in order to deceive.
Zechariah,13,5,"He will say: I am not a prophet; I work the land, for a man purchased me as a servant since my youth."
Zechariah,13,6,If someone asks him: What are these wounds on your chest?—then he will answer: I received the wounds in the house of my friends.
Zechariah,13,7,"Sword, awake against My shepherd, against the man who is My associate— this is the declaration of the LORD of Hosts. Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered; I will also turn My hand against the little ones."
Zechariah,13,8,"In the whole land— this is the LORD’s declaration— two-thirds will be cut off and die, but a third will be left in it."
Zechariah,13,9,"I will put this third through the fire; I will refine them as silver is refined and test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name, and I will answer them. I will say: They are My people, and they will say: Yahweh is our God.”"
Zechariah,14,1,A day of the LORD is coming when your plunder will be divided in your presence.
