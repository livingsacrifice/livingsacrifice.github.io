Genesis,1,1,"In the very start, God made the sky and the earth."
Genesis,1,2,"So basically, at first, the earth was a hot mess. It didn't have any structure or anything, just emptiness and darkness all around. But then, the Spirit of God started doing its thing, cruising over the oceans."
Genesis,1,3,"Then God was like, 'Yo, let there be light,' and boom, there was light."
Genesis,1,4,"And God was like, 'Yo, this light is lit!' So, God separated the light from the darkness. Like, He made sure they don't mix, you know?"
Genesis,1,5,"So, like, God named the light as Day and the darkness as Night. And, you know, that whole cycle of evening and morning, it marked the first day. It's like, just to clarify, the evening came, and then the morning came, and that's how the first day went down."
Genesis,1,6,"And God was like, yo, there should be, like, this cool layer between the water, separating it from more water. And like, this layer is actually called the 'expansion'."
Genesis,1,7,"And then God created, like, this super cool, massive sky thing, and He split up the water below it from the water above it. And guess what? It totally happened, just like that!"
Genesis,1,8,"So God named the sky Heaven. And it became the second day after the evening and morning passed. {And the evening...: Hebrew text clarifies that the evening came and the morning came, marking a new day.}"
Genesis,1,9,"And God was like, yo, let's bring all the water together in one place and make some solid ground, and just like that, it happened."
Genesis,1,10,"And God was like, 'Yo, let's name that solid ground Earth,' and the whole watery party He called Seas. And you know what? God thought it was all pretty lit."
Genesis,1,11,"And God was all like, yo, let the earth do its thing and grow some sick grass, and some dope herbs that bring forth seeds, and also some lit fruit trees that produce fruit after their kind, with seeds in themselves, all up in the earth. And guess what? Boom! It happened, just like that. (By the way, 'grass' in Hebrew means some really fresh and tender grass, just FYI.)"
Genesis,1,12,"And then, like, the earth totally grew some awesome grass and plants that had seeds of their own. Oh, and there were these cool trees that grew yummy fruits with seeds too! And God was like, 'Yo, that's super good!'"
Genesis,1,13,"So, like, the third day came to an end and a new day began. It's like, you know, the evening turned into morning. Just to clarify, when I say 'evening' I mean the start of the day and when I say 'morning' I mean the end of the day, you feel me?"
Genesis,1,14,"And God was like, 'Yo, we need some lights up in the sky to separate the day from the night. They'll be there as signs and to mark the seasons, days, and years, ya know? It's like the perfect balance between day and night!"
Genesis,1,15,"And, like, God made these things called stars and stuff in the sky to, like, give light to the earth. And, bro, it totally happened. No lie."
Genesis,1,16,"And God created two awesome sources of light: one super bright light to be in charge of the day, and another not-so-bright light to be in charge of the night. Oh, and He also made all those cool stars! #dayandnightvibes"
Genesis,1,17,"Yo, God placed those celestial bodies up in the sky to illuminate the earth."
Genesis,1,18,"And like, to have power over the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God was like, 'Yo, that's lit!'"
Genesis,1,19,"And then there was the fourth day, with its evening and morning. You know, like when the sun sets and then rises again. Pretty cool, right? (By the way, the Hebrew version says basically the same thing but in a different way, just so you know)"
Genesis,1,20,"And God was like, yo, it's time for the waters to be filled with all sorts of dope creatures that have life, and birds that can soar high up in the sky, in that wide-open space above the earth. By the way, when I say 'moving creatures,' I mean the ones that crawl or whatever. And when I say lifee,' I mean those creatures with souls. And when I say 'birds,' I mean the ones that are good at flying. And when I say 'wide-open space,' I mean the face of that cool firmament in the sky."
Genesis,1,21,"And yo, God made these dope whales and every livin' creature that be movin', which be poppin' outta the waters in mad numbers, each one accord'n to its kind, and all them flyin' birds accord'n to their kind too: and God peeped that it was all good, ya heard?"
Genesis,1,22,"And God was like, yo fam, I got you! Blessing all of y'all, He was like, go forth and prosper, make yourselves fruitful and multiply like crazy, dominate the oceans with all kinds of fish, and let the birds go wild and multiply all over the land."
Genesis,1,23,"And like, the evening and the morning vibes were totally on point, it was the lit fifth day. {And the evening...: Heb. And the evening was, and the morning was etc.}"
Genesis,1,24,"And God was like, 'Yo, earth! Time to bring out the living creatures, like, each one according to their own kind: cattle, creepy crawlies, and all the beasts of the land.' And guess what? It totally happened, just like that."
Genesis,1,25,"And God created all the animals on the earth, like, totally each according to its own kind, you know? The wild beasts, the farm animals, and even all the creeping things, all unique and special in their own way. And when God looked at everything He made, He was like, 'That's good, man!'"
Genesis,1,26,"Yo, God was like, 'Check it, let's make humans look and act like us, and let them be in charge of the fish in the ocean, the birds in the sky, all the animals on land, and everything that crawls on the ground.'"
Genesis,1,27,"God was like, 'Yo, I'm gonna make humans just like me, you know? So he made them in his image. And get this, he made them both male and female. Double the awesomeness!"
Genesis,1,28,"And God straight up blessed them, and He was all like, 'Yo, be productive and reproduce like crazy, and fill up the earth with your peeps. Oh, and you got the power to control the fish in the sea, birds in the sky, and basically any living thing that's roaming around. You got this!'"
Genesis,1,29,"Yo, peep this: God's like, 'Check it, I hooked you up with all the plants that have seeds on the planet, and every tree with fruit that has seeds too. You can eat 'em all, they're your grub. For real!"
Genesis,1,30,"And I made sure that all the animals on the earth, birds in the sky, and every living creature that crawls on the ground had plenty of green plants to eat. They all depended on it for survival, and that's exactly what happened. (By the way, when I say 'living creatures' I mean beings with a soul – pretty cool, huh?)"
Genesis,1,31,"And God looked at everything he created, and wow, it was totally awesome! And then the day turned into night and then back to morning, completing the sixth day.""}"
Genesis,2,1,"So, like, the sky and the earth were totally done being created, and everything that lives in them, you know?"
Genesis,2,2,"And like after finishing his epic creation, God was just like, 'Yo, I'm done.' So on the seventh day, he decided it was time to chill and take a break from all the hard work he put in."
Genesis,2,3,"And God was like, 'Yo, the seventh day is lit af!' He blessed it and made it holy because He finally took a break from all the work He did in creating and making everything."
Genesis,2,4,"So, like, this is, like, the story of how the sky and the earth were made, ya know? It all happened way back in the day when the LORD God made everything, like the earth and the heavens."
Genesis,2,5,"And before all the plants and herbs of the field could grow, before they even existed, God had not made it rain on the earth and there weren't any humans to take care of the land."
Genesis,2,6,Then a mist rose from the earth and watered the entire surface of the ground.
Genesis,2,7,God created the first person by shaping them from the dirt and breathing life into their nose. That's how they became a living being.
Genesis,2,8,"So, like, God created this super rad garden in Eden and placed the dude He had made right there, to the east."
Genesis,2,9,"Then God, like, totally grew all these awesome trees from the ground that are, like, super pleasing to look at and great for munching on. There was even this one tree called the tree of life right in the middle of the garden, and another one called the tree of knowledge of good and evil."
Genesis,2,10,"So, like, there was this totally rad river flowing out of Eden to water the garden. And then, it, like, split into four different streams, covering the whole place."
Genesis,2,11,"The first spot is called Pison, and it's the area all around Havilah. You know, that place where they find lots of gold."
Genesis,2,12,The gold over there is legit amazing: they've got bdellium and onyx stones too.
Genesis,2,13,"The second river is called Gihon—it's the one that flows all around the land of Ethiopia. (Ethiopia is also known as Cush, by the way.)"
Genesis,2,14,"The third river is called Hiddekel, and it flows towards the east of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates."
Genesis,2,15,"Then God, yo, took the homie and dropped him in the Garden of Eden to work on that greenery and keep it in check. The homie being Adam, you know what I'm saying?"
Genesis,2,16,"So, like, God was straight up telling the dude, 'Yo, you can totally munch on any tree in the garden, like for real, go ahead and feast on all of it!'"
Genesis,2,17,"Yo, don't mess with that tree that's all about knowing good and evil. If you go ahead and eat from it, trust me, you're gonna be in major trouble. Like, you'll literally be doomed to die on the day you take a bite."
Genesis,2,18,"Yo, the LORD God was like, it's not cool for this dude to be all by himself. I got his back though, I'm gonna create a perfect partner for him."
Genesis,2,19,"So, like, God created all the animals on the earth and in the sky, yo. And then He took them to Adam to see what he would name them, you know? And whatever names Adam gave them, that was their official name, man. (Adam could also mean the man, just saying.)"
Genesis,2,20,"So, Adam was like, naming all the animals, the birds, and every wild creature out there. But, he couldn't find a suitable companion for himself."
Genesis,2,21,"So, God made Adam super tired and he fell into a really deep sleep. While he was snoozing, God took out one of his ribs and patched up the spot with flesh."
Genesis,2,22,"Then God took one of Adam's ribs and used it to create a woman, whom He brought to Adam."
Genesis,2,23,"Adam was like, 'Yo, this girl is straight-up a part of me. She's made from my own bones and flesh, so let's call her Woman, 'cause she came from Man.' (In Hebrew, Woman is Isha, and Man is Ish.)"
Genesis,2,24,"So basically, when a dude grows up, he's gonna bounce from his parents and hang tight with his wifey. And let me tell you, they gonna be super connected, like they a single unit."
Genesis,2,25,"So like, the man and his wife were totally without clothes, and they were cool with it, no shame or anything.""}"
Genesis,3,1,"So, this snake, right, it was like super sneaky compared to all the other animals that God created in the field. And it goes up to the woman and says, 'Hey, did God really say you can't eat from any tree in the garden? Like, seriously?'"
Genesis,3,2,"The woman was like, 'Yo, Mr. Snake, we can totally chow down on any of the fruit from these wicked cool trees in the garden! 🍎🌳'"
Genesis,3,3,"But like, there's this tree in the garden, and God's like, 'Don't eat from it or even touch it, or you're toast.'"" }"
Genesis,3,4,"And the serpent was like, 'Nah, girl, you ain't gonna die for real:'"
Genesis,3,5,"God knows that once you eat it, your eyes will be opened and you'll be able to understand good and evil, feeling a lot more enlightened, like gods."
Genesis,3,6,"So, the woman looked at the tree and saw that it had delicious food on it and looked really nice. Plus, she thought it would make her wise. She couldn't resist, so she took a bite from its fruit and shared it with her husband. And guess what? He took a bite too."
Genesis,3,7,"Then both of them suddenly became aware that they were naked. So, they quickly stitched together some fig leaves and fashioned them into cover-ups."
Genesis,3,8,"And they totally heard God's voice strolling through the garden, like chillaxing in the afternoon breeze. And Adam and his wifey were like, 'OMG, we gotta hide from the Almighty!' So they went all ninja mode, camouflaging themselves amongst the trees. BTW, 'cool' in Hebrew means 'wind'. No biggie."
Genesis,3,9,"God hollers at Adam like, 'Yo, where you at, bro?"
Genesis,3,10,"And he was like, yo, I heard you calling out in the garden and I got hella scared because I realized I was naked, so I straight up hid myself."
Genesis,3,11,"And God was like, 'Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat from the tree even though I told you not to?'""}"
Genesis,3,12,"So the guy was like, 'Yo, God, it's not my fault! That chick you gave me, she made me eat from the tree!'"
Genesis,3,13,"So, like, the Lord God was all like, yo woman, what's up with what you just did? And the woman was like, the snake tricked me, and I couldn't resist, and I ended up eating the thing."
Genesis,3,14,"And like, God was all like, 'Yo, serpent! Since you pulled that shady move, you're straight-up cursed more than any other animal out there. You'll be crawling on your belly and munching on dirt for the rest of your days, no joke.'"
Genesis,3,15,"And I will make things real tough between you and the woman, and between your crew and her crew; someone's gonna knock you down hard, but you'll manage to hurt them a bit too."
Genesis,3,16,"To the woman, He said, 'I know things are going to get tough for you when it comes to giving birth and raising kids. It's gonna be a struggle, but your love and dedication will be towards your husband, and he will take the lead in your relationship. {'Subject to your husband' is another way to put it.}"" }"
Genesis,3,17,"And God was like, 'Adam, bro, 'cause you listened to your wife and ate from that tree after I specifically told you not to, the ground is totally cursed now. You're gonna have to work super hard and deal with a lot of pain and struggle just to get food for the rest of your life, man."
Genesis,3,18,"It's gonna be rough when it comes to growing stuff, you'll have to deal with thorns and thistles. And hey, forget about gourmet meals – you'll be feasting on plain ol' grass from the field. 🌱"
Genesis,3,19,"You're gonna have to work hard to put food on the table, until the day you die and become one with the earth again. 'Cause hey, we all came from dust, and back to dust we go."
Genesis,3,20,"And Adam gave his wife the name Eve, because she was the mother of all living. {Eve: in Hebrew, her name is Chavah, which means Living}"
Genesis,3,21,Then God hooked Adam and his wife up with some fresh animal skin drip.
Genesis,3,22,"Yo, God was like, check it, man has leveled up and is now vibing on our wavelength, knowing what's good and what's not. But hold up, if he goes ahead and snags some of that tree of life and chows down, he gonna live forever. Can't have that, tho."
Genesis,3,23,"So, like, God was like 'bye' and kicked him out of the garden of Eden to go farming, which is where he came from in the first place."
Genesis,3,24,"Then he kicked the guy out and put these angelic beings with flaming swords on the east side of the garden, guarding the path to the tree that gives everlasting life.""}"
Genesis,4,1,"Adam and Eve did the deed, and she got pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said, 'I've acquired a man with God's help.' (Cain means 'gotten' or 'acquired')"
Genesis,4,2,"Then she gave birth to another boy named Abel. Abel took care of sheep, while Cain worked as a farmer. (Abel means 'breath' in Hebrew. 'A keeper' means 'a feeder' in Hebrew.)"
Genesis,4,3,"After a while, Cain decided to bring an offering to the LORD. He brought some fruits from the ground as his offering."
Genesis,4,4,"Abel rolled up with some top-notch sheep and some prime fat from his flock. And man, the big man upstairs was totally feeling it. He showed mad love to Abel and his offering."
Genesis,4,5,But God did not approve of Cain and his offering. This made Cain really angry and upset.
Genesis,4,6,"And God was like, 'Dude, why you so pissed? What's up with that gloomy face of yours?'"
Genesis,4,7,"Yo, if you're doing things right, won't you be accepted? But if you're not, sin is hanging out, ready to trip you up. And you, my friend, have the power to rule over it. #Respect"
Genesis,4,8,"So, Cain and Abel were having a convo, you know, just chillin' in the field. And then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, Cain straight up attacked Abel and, unfortunately, killed him."
Genesis,4,9,"And God was like, 'Hey Cain, where's your brother Abel?' And Cain was like, 'IDK man, am I supposed to be responsible for him?'"
Genesis,4,10,"And God was like, 'Dude, what did you do? Your brother's blood is literally calling out to me from the ground. It's like a super intense cry for justice, you know? #bloods"
Genesis,4,11,"And now, it's like a major bummer, but the earth is totally not vibing with you anymore. It opened up and took in your bro's blood after you messed up big time."
Genesis,4,12,"When you work the land, it won't produce its harvest for you anymore. You'll wander the earth as a lost soul, forever on the run."
Genesis,4,13,"Cain was like, Godd, this punishment you're giving me is just too much for me to handle. My mistakes are so heavy, it feels like they can't be forgiven.'"" }"
Genesis,4,14,"Yo, check it. Today, you've totally kicked me outta this place and now I won't be able to see you anymore. I'm gonna be like a wanderer without a home, just roaming around. And guess what? Anyone who crosses paths with me is gonna wanna take me out."
Genesis,4,15,"Then God said to him, look, if anyone kills Cain, they will face seven times the punishment. So God marked Cain to protect him from anyone who might harm him."
Genesis,4,16,"So Cain bounced out of God's sight and settled down in this cool place called Nod, over yonder east of Eden."
Genesis,4,17,"So Cain and his wife got together and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son named Enoch. Then Cain went on to build a city and named it after his son, Enoch."
Genesis,4,18,"And then Enoch became a father to Irad, who later had a son named Mehujael. Mehujael in turn had a son named Methusael, and Methusael was the father of Lamech. (Note: Lamech is the same as Lemech in Hebrew.)"
Genesis,4,19,Lamech was totally down with having two wives - one called Adah and the other called Zillah.
Genesis,4,20,And Adah gave birth to Jabal: he was like the OG dad of those who live in tents and have cattle.
Genesis,4,21,"Jubal, the dude's brother, was all about those sick tunes. He was like, the OG who started the whole harp and organ trend."
Genesis,4,22,"And Zillah also had Tubalcain, who was known for his skills in working with brass and iron. Tubalcain's sister was named Naamah. (Whetter means someone who sharpens tools)"
Genesis,4,23,"Lamech was like, 'Listen up, Adah and Zillah, my badass wives! Pay attention to what I'm saying: I totally messed up by killing a dude, and it's seriously messing with me. It's like I hurt myself by attacking this young guy. It's messed up, man.'"
Genesis,4,24,"If someone messes with Cain and gets seven times the punishment, then just imagine how intense it'll be for anyone who messes with Lamech, 'cause he's gonna bring it seventy-seven times harder."
Genesis,4,25,"And Adam got to know his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth. She said, Godd has given me another child to replace Abel, whom Cain killed.' (Seth means 'appointed' or 'put' in Hebrew.)"
Genesis,4,26,"And Seth had a son named Enos, which means human. It was around this time that people started connecting with the divine and seeking guidance from the LORD.""}"
Genesis,5,1,"Yo, this is the story of Adam and his fam. When God made humans, He made 'em in His own image, yo."
Genesis,5,2,"God made them male and female, and gave them His blessing. He called them Adam when He created them."
Genesis,5,3,And Adam reached the age of 130 and had a child who was just like him and looked just like him. He named him Seth.
Genesis,5,4,"After Adam had Seth, he went on to live a whopping eight hundred years and had lots of sons and daughters, no cap!"
Genesis,5,5,"So like, Adam was around for a solid 930 years before he passed away. Like, he lived a looong time, but eventually, his time just came to an end."
Genesis,5,6,"And Seth lived to be 105 years old, and became the father of Enos: (Enos means Enosh in Hebrew)"
Genesis,5,7,"Seth lived for a long time, about 807 years after he had a kid named Enos. During those years, he had lots of sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,8,Seth lived for a solid 912 years and then kicked the bucket.
Genesis,5,9,"Enos was around for a solid ninety years and then became the proud parent of Cainan, also known as Kenan."
Genesis,5,10,"And Enos, like, lived for eight hundred and fifteen years after he had Cainan, and he also had sons and daughters, you know?"
Genesis,5,11,"Enos was alive for a really long time, like 905 years, and then he passed away."
Genesis,5,12,"And Cainan was around for like seventy years, and then he had a kid named Mahalaleel. (P.S. Mahalaleel is sometimes referred to as Maleleel in Greek.)"
Genesis,5,13,"And Cainan lived for, like, eight hundred and forty more years after he had Mahalaleel. During that time, he also had a bunch of sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,14,"Cainan lived a solid 910 years, then he passed on."
Genesis,5,15,And Mahalaleel was alive for 65 years and became the father of Jared.
Genesis,5,16,"And Mahalaleel lived for another 830 years after he had Jared, and had many sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,17,"And Mahalaleel lived for 895 years, and then he passed away."
Genesis,5,18,"So Jared was around for 162 years, and then he became the father of Enoch:"
Genesis,5,19,"And Jared lived for a whopping 800 years after becoming a dad to Enoch. During that time, he also had a bunch of sons and daughters."
Genesis,5,20,And Jared lived for a cool 962 years before he passed away.
Genesis,5,21,"So yeah, Enoch was around for 65 years and then he became a dad to Methuselah (btw, he's also known as Mathusala in Greek)."
Genesis,5,22,"And Enoch was all about that quality time with God, for a solid three hundred years after he became a dad to Methuselah. Oh, and he also went ahead and had a bunch of sons and daughters, too!"
Genesis,5,23,And Enoch lived for a total of 365 years.
Genesis,5,24,"And Enoch was tight with God, like they were always homies, and then one day he just disappeared. God straight up scooped him up."
Genesis,5,25,"And Methuselah was alive for 187 years, and then had a child named Lamech:"
Genesis,5,26,"And Methuselah kept on living for a super long time, like 782 years, after he became a dad to Lamech. He also had a bunch of other kids, too!"
Genesis,5,27,And Methuselah lived for a whopping 969 years before he passed on.
Genesis,5,28,"And Lamech, he lived for like 182 years, and then he became a dad and had a son."
Genesis,5,29,"Then he named him Noah, which means 'rest' or 'comfort' in Greek, saying, 'This guy is gonna bring us some relief from all the hard work and sweat we put into our jobs, because of the ground that God cursed.'"
Genesis,5,30,"And Lamech was around for a solid 595 years after he became a dad to Noah. During that time, he also had some other kids, both boys and girls. Such a long and blessed life!"
Genesis,5,31,And Lamech lived for a pretty epic 777 years before he passed away.
Genesis,5,32,"Noah was like 500 years old when he became a dad to Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Can you believe it?!""}"
Genesis,6,1,"So, like, it happened when more and more people started coming around on this planet, and these guys started having daughters, you know?"
Genesis,6,2,"So, like, the heavenly dudes noticed how gorgeous the human gals were, and they decided to marry them, like whoever they wanted."
Genesis,6,3,"And God was like, I can't deal with humans forever, 'cause they're just so human, you know? But I'll give them, like, 120 years to figure it out."
Genesis,6,4,"Back in the day, there were some seriously massive humans on the earth. And even later, when these gods-like dudes hooked up with mortal ladies and had kids with them, those kids turned out to be super powerful and well-known."
Genesis,6,5,"And OMG, God looked down on the Earth and was like, 'Yo, humans are straight up wicked AF. Like, literally everything they think about is evil, without a break. And I mean, not just their thoughts, but also their desires and plans.' And this isn't just a one-time thing, it's like an everyday occurrence."
Genesis,6,6,God was so bummed and regretted creating humans on earth. It really broke His heart.
Genesis,6,7,"And God was like, 'Yo, I'm pretty bummed out about creating humans and animals and stuff. I think I'm gonna wipe them all out from the face of the earth.'"
Genesis,6,8,But Noah was totally favored by the LORD.
Genesis,6,9,"This is the story of Noah's fam: Noah was a righteous dude who kept it real, not just for himself, but for his peeps too. He had a tight connection with God, always keeping it on point. (Just so you know, 'perfect' here means upright, not flawless, ya know?)"
Genesis,6,10,"And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. They were the real OGs of Noah's fam."
Genesis,6,11,"Yo, the earth was totally messed up in God's eyes, like for real. It was all kinds of messed up and violence was everywhere."
Genesis,6,12,"And God checked out the earth, and like, woah, it was messed up; 'cause everyone had messed up their way of living on the earth."
Genesis,6,13,"God told Noah, 'I'm seeing how messed up everything has become, with all the violence happening. It's too much. I'm gonna wipe them all out, along with the whole earth.'"
Genesis,6,14,"Okay, so here's the deal: build yourself a really cool ark out of gopher wood. And get this, you gotta make some rooms inside the ark, comfy ones! Now, here comes the important part - you gotta totally seal that bad boy inside and out with some pitch. You know, that sticky stuff. Oh, and by the way, when it says 'rooms,' it actually means 'nests' in Hebrew. Just a fun fact for ya!"
Genesis,6,15,"And here's the deal for building that ark: It's gonna be 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits tall, just like that."
Genesis,6,16,"Yo, make a window on the ark, and make it like a cubit above; and place the door of the ark on its side. And you gotta build it with three levels: lower, second, and third."
Genesis,6,17,"Yo, listen up! I'm about to bring down a massive flood on the whole earth. It's gonna wipe out all living creatures that have the breath of life in 'em, everything on this planet is gonna die."
Genesis,6,18,"But I'm gonna make a deal with you, and you and your squad will hop on the ark - you, your sons, your wifey, and your sons' baes. We're in this together fam!"
Genesis,6,19,"And you gotta bring two of every different kind of living thing into the ark, so they can stay alive with you. They gotta be a guy and a girl."
Genesis,6,20,"Yo, you're gonna have all kinds of birds, animals, and creepy crawlies pullin' up, representing their own kind. They're comin' in pairs, man, to make sure they stay alive and kickin'."
Genesis,6,21,"Yo, grab some of every kind of food that people eat and stash it, it's gonna be your food and their food too."
Genesis,6,22,"Noah totally came through, doing everything God told him to do, no questions asked. He was totally on point!""}"
Genesis,7,1,"And God was like, 'Yo Noah, it's time to gather up your whole fam and slide into this ark. You've been keeping it real with me and staying righteous while everyone else is losing their way."
Genesis,7,2,"Yo, you gotta gather up seven of each clean animal, the male and its female. And for the unclean animals, just take two, the male and its female. (By the way, when it says 'by sevens' in Hebrew, it means 'seven seven'.)"
Genesis,7,3,"So, like, God was like, 'Yo, birds in the sky, come on, two of each gender, but like, also seven pairs, just to, you know, keep the whole bird population going strong across the entire earth, ya feel? Oh, and by the way, 'seven seven' in Hebrew basically means 'a lot, a lot.'"" }"
Genesis,7,4,"Listen up fam, in just one week, Imma make it rain for 40 straight days and nights. And let me tell you, everything that's alive that I've created? It's all gonna be wiped out, deleted, gone from the face of this earth. No more, gonezo. #blotout"
Genesis,7,5,"So Noah basically did exactly what the LORD told him to do, no questions asked."
Genesis,7,6,"Noah was, like, totally six hundred years old when the big flood happened and covered the whole earth with water. Can you believe that?"
Genesis,7,7,"So Noah and his squad, including his wife and his sons' baez, all went into the ark to escape the massive flood waters."
Genesis,7,8,"All types of animals, whether they're considered clean or not, and birds, and every living creature that crawls on the ground,"
Genesis,7,9,"Then two by two, both the guys and the girls, went into the ark to chill with Noah, just like how God told him to do."
Genesis,7,10,"So, like, after a whole week, it happened - the floodwater came rushing onto the earth."
Genesis,7,11,"When Noah was six hundred years old, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, something amazing happened. The mighty deep burst open all at once, and the gates of heaven were wide open too. Wow, what a sight!"
Genesis,7,12,"So, like, it rained nonstop for a whole forty days and nights."
Genesis,7,13,"On that very day, Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth—the sons of Noah—along with Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons, all entered the ark together."
Genesis,7,14,"So, like, all the animals and stuff, each according to their own kind, and all the cattle, and every kind of creepy crawling thing on the earth, also according to their kind, and all the birds, like, every type of bird, you know, with all their different wings and stuff. #diversity"
Genesis,7,15,"And all the animals entered the ark, two by two, to be with Noah. This included every living creature, with the breath of life within them."
Genesis,7,16,"And all the different kinds of animals, with both males and females, entered the ark just as God had told Noah. Then the LORD closed the door behind them."
Genesis,7,17,"So, like, the flood lasted for a whole 40 days, you know? And the water kept rising and lifted up the ark, above the earth and stuff."
Genesis,7,18,"Then the water kept rising and grew a lot, covering the entire earth. The ark floated on the surface of the water."
Genesis,7,19,"So, like, the water totally took over the earth and, like, even the super tall hills everywhere were completely, like, underwater."
Genesis,7,20,The water went up by fifteen cubits and even the mountains got submerged.
Genesis,7,21,"And, like, every living thing, ya know, like birds, animals, and bugs, and even humans, they all died. No joke."
Genesis,7,22,"Every living creature on land, with the breath of life in their nostrils, perished. They were all gone, from animals to humans, as their life force, the spirit within, left their bodies."
Genesis,7,23,"So like, everything on the earth got wiped out—like, all living things, humans and animals and the little creepy crawlies and birds in the sky—just gone. Poof! Except for Noah and those chillin' with him on the ark, they were the only ones left surviving, man."
Genesis,7,24,"And the water totally took over the whole earth for like a hundred and fifty days straight. It was intense, dude.""}"
Genesis,8,1,"And then God was like, 'Oh yeah, Noah and all the animals in the ark, I got you!' So God caused a cool breeze to blow over the earth, and the flood waters calmed down."
Genesis,8,2,"The huge water sources and the sky's openings got shut down, and the rainfall from above was held back."
Genesis,8,3,"And the waters kept going back and forth from the earth, non-stop. And after a hundred and fifty days, the waters started to calm down."
Genesis,8,4,"And the ark finally stopped in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day, up on the mountains of Ararat."
Genesis,8,5,"And the water kept on going down until the tenth month. Then, on the first day of that month, the tops of the mountains became visible."
Genesis,8,6,"So, after like 40 days, Noah was like, 'Yo, let's open this window on the ark he built.'"
Genesis,8,7,"Then he let a raven out, which flew back and forth until the waters dried up from the earth."
Genesis,8,8,So he let a dove go to see if the water had gone down from the ground.
Genesis,8,9,"But the dove couldn't find a chill spot for her foot, so she went back to the ark. The whole earth was filled with water, you know. Then, dude stretched out his hand, like totally reached out and brought her back into the ark. He made her come, ya know?"
Genesis,8,10,"And after waiting another whole week, he sent the dove out of the ark once more."
Genesis,8,11,"Then, like, this dove flew back to Noah in the evening, and, whoa, in its mouth was a fresh olive leaf that it had picked! That's when Noah realized that the floodwaters had finally gone down."
Genesis,8,12,"Then he waited for another week and let the dove go; but this time, it didn't come back to him at all."
Genesis,8,13,"So, like, after six hundred and one years, in the first month and on the first day of the month, the waters like totally dried up from the earth. Then Noah uncovered the ark and peeped outside and, yo, the ground was all dry and stuff!"
Genesis,8,14,"So, like, in the second month, on the 27th day, the earth finally dried up."
Genesis,8,15,"So basically, God started talking to Noah, like,"
Genesis,8,16,"Alright, time to leave the ark! You, your spouse, your kids, and your kids' partners, come out with you."
Genesis,8,17,"Yo, take all the living creatures that are with you - every type of animal, bird, and crawling thing on the earth. Let them all come out and thrive, multiply and fill up the earth with their offspring."
Genesis,8,18,"So like, Noah and his fam - his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives - they all bounced together:"
Genesis,8,19,"Every animal, every creature that crawls, and every bird, and whatever creeps upon the earth, according to their various species, came out of the ark."
Genesis,8,20,So Noah made an altar for the LORD and brought some clean animals and clean birds to offer as burnt offerings on the altar.
Genesis,8,21,"God thought the smell was nice and said to himself, 'I won't curse the ground anymore because of people, even though they have evil thoughts from a young age. And I won't destroy all living things like I did before.'"
Genesis,8,22,"As long as the earth's still kickin', we'll keep havin' those times to plant and harvest crops, experience both chilly and hot weather, go through summer and winter, and have day and night. It's not gonna stop anytime soon, trust me. {While...: Heb. Yo, this goes for all the days the earth's been here}""}"
Genesis,9,1,"And God was like, 'Yo, Noah and his sons, you're totally blessed! I want you to like, go out there and do your thing, make lots of babies and spread out all over the earth.'"
Genesis,9,2,"Every animal, bird, creature, and fish will look up to you with respect and a little bit of awe. They all know that you have dominion over them. It's like you have this cool superpower that lets you take charge of the whole animal kingdom!"
Genesis,9,3,"You can chow down on any living creature, just like how I've given you the green herb to enjoy."
Genesis,9,4,"Don't munch on any meat that still has its life force, aka its blood."
Genesis,9,5,"Yo, I gotta make this clear: if someone takes a life - human or animal - I'm holding them accountable for it. Like, seriously, everyone's responsible for their own actions. No one can just go around harming others without facing the consequences."
Genesis,9,6,"If anyone takes a human's life, their own life should be taken, because every person is created in God's image."
Genesis,9,7,"Yo, go ahead and be productive, like, really go for it, and increase in numbers; bring forth plenty in the Earth and expand your influence there."
Genesis,9,8,"So, like, God started talking to Noah and his sons, and He was like,"
Genesis,9,9,"And yo, check it, I'm making a solid pact with you and your future fam, no cap."
Genesis,9,10,"And also, don't forget about every living thing that's rollin' with you on this ride - birds, cows, and all the animals on land. From the ones who walked out of the ark to every beast out there, we got 'em covered."
Genesis,9,11,"And yo, I'mma make a solid deal with you, fam. No more total wipeout for all living beings by a flood, nah. Earth won't get destroyed by that again, swear."
Genesis,9,12,"God was like, 'Yo, listen up! This is how you'll know that I made a deal with you and every living thing around you, for like, forever and ever:"
Genesis,9,13,"So, like, check it out, I'm putting my rad bow up in the sky, and it's gonna be this awesome sign that represents the super amazing agreement I made with the whole earth."
Genesis,9,14,"Yo, listen up! So, here's the deal: when I make a cloud cover the whole earth, you're gonna spot this awesome rainbow in that cloud, no cap!"
Genesis,9,15,"And I'll totally remember the promise I made to you and every living creature on this planet. Like, I promise there won't be another massive flood that wipes out all the living beings."
Genesis,9,16,And there will be a rainbow in the sky; and I'll check it out to remember the never-ending promise between God and all the living creatures on earth.
Genesis,9,17,"And God was like, 'Yo Noah, this is the sign of the deal I made with all living creatures on earth.'"" }"
Genesis,9,18,"So, after Noah and his family hopped off the ark, his sons were named Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And you know what? Ham became the dad of Canaan. (Just so you know, Canaan is also called Chenaan in Hebrew)."" }"
Genesis,9,19,"So basically, Noah had three sons, and from them, the whole earth got filled up."
Genesis,9,20,Noah started being into farming and decided to plant some vineyard:
Genesis,9,21,"And he, like, drank some wine and got wasted, and ended up not wearing clothes in his tent."
Genesis,9,22,"So Ham, Canaan's dad, accidentally saw his dad naked and told his two brothers about it."
Genesis,9,23,"So Shem and Japheth grabbed a cool hoodie, put it on together, and walked backward to cover their dad's exposed self. They made sure not to look so that their eyes wouldn't catch a glimpse."
Genesis,9,24,And Noah woke up from his wine and realized what his younger son had done to him.
Genesis,9,25,"And he was like, Canaan is totally cursed, dude. He's gonna be, like, the ultimate servant to his brothers, man."
Genesis,9,26,"And he was like, yo, the LORD God of Shem is straight up blessed, and Canaan is gonna be his servant and everything. Canaan's gonna serve them real good, you feel me?"
Genesis,9,27,"God's gonna hook Japheth up, and he'll be kickin' it in Shem's crib. Canaan gonna be workin' for him."
Genesis,9,28,And Noah kept on living for another 350 years after the big flood. Can you believe it?
Genesis,9,29,"And yo, Noah lived for a straight 950 years, and then he bounced from this earthly realm.""}"
Genesis,10,1,"So here's the story of Noah's sons - Shem, Ham, and Japheth. They had some kids after the big flood happened."
Genesis,10,2,"The dudes from Japheth's line were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras."
Genesis,10,3,"And Gomer's sons were Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah."
Genesis,10,4,"And Javan had some chill sons, like Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. (Some people call them Rodanim, but don't stress about it.)"
Genesis,10,5,"So like, back in the day, the Gentiles had their own spots and territories. They would speak different languages and have their own family clans, you know, representing their nations."
Genesis,10,6,"And Ham had four sons named Cush, Mizraim, Phut, and Canaan."
Genesis,10,7,"And Cush had these sons: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabtecha. Then Raamah had two sons: Sheba and Dedan."
Genesis,10,8,"And Cush had a son named Nimrod, who quickly gained a reputation as a powerful figure among the people."
Genesis,10,9,"Nimrod was the ultimate hunter, impressing even the LORD Himself. That's why people say, Nimrod was the ultimate hunter in the eyes of the LORD."
Genesis,10,10,"So, like, the start of his kingdom was all about Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh. They were located in the land of Shinar, you know? Oh, and just to clarify, Babel is the same as Babylon in Greek."
Genesis,10,11,"Asshur left that place and founded cities like Nineveh, Rehoboth, and Calah in Assyria. These cities were bustling with streets and life!"
Genesis,10,12,"And there's this awesome city called Resen, located right smack between Nineveh and Calah. It's seriously a happening place!"
Genesis,10,13,"Mizraim had kids named Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, and Naphtuhim."
Genesis,10,14,"And there were Pathrusim, Casluhim (from whom the Philistines came), and Caphtorim."
Genesis,10,15,"And Canaan had a son named Sidon, who was his oldest, and also Heth."
Genesis,10,16,"And like, there were these people called Jebusites, Amorites, and Girgasites,"
Genesis,10,17,"And there were also the Hivite, Arkite, and Sinite people,"
Genesis,10,18,"And then you had the Arvadite crew, the Zemarite squad, and the Hamathite peeps. And after that, the Canaanites just multiplied and spread out all over the place, fam."
Genesis,10,19,"The Canaanites ruled a territory stretching from Sidon, all the way to Gerar and Gaza. As you journeyed, you'd pass through Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboim, and finally Lasha. (Gaza was also called Azzah in Hebrew.)"
Genesis,10,20,"These were the kids of Ham, representing their different backgrounds, languages, regions, and cultures."
Genesis,10,21,"So, like, Shem, who's like the dad of all the kids of Eber, you know? And he's, like, Japheth's older bro. And, yeah, Shem had his own kiddos too, just so you know."
Genesis,10,22,"The fam of Shem included Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram. (Arphaxad is also known as Arpachshad in Hebrew.)"
Genesis,10,23,"And the descendants of Aram were Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash."
Genesis,10,24,"And Arphaxad had a son named Salah, and Salah had a son named Eber. (Salah means Shelah in Hebrew)"
Genesis,10,25,"""Yo, Eber had two sons: one called Peleg, because during his time, the earth got split up, and his bro was named Joktan. Peleg means 'division,' by the way."""
Genesis,10,26,"And Joktan had three sons named Almodad, Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, as well as a son named Jerah."
Genesis,10,27,"And, like, Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah were also part of it, you know?"
Genesis,10,28,"And like, Obal, Abimael, and Sheba,"
Genesis,10,29,"And Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab were among the sons of Joktan."
Genesis,10,30,"And they stayed in Mesha, going all the way to Sephar in the eastern mountains."
Genesis,10,31,"So, like, these are the dudes from Shem’s fam, right? They had their own tribes and languages and lived all around the world, each with their own nation."
Genesis,10,32,"So basically, these are the fams of Noah's sons, generations later, in different nations. And yeah, the world got all split up after the flood, thanks to them.""}"
Genesis,11,1,"At one time, everyone on the earth spoke the same language and communicated in the same way. (In Hebrew, they called it 'lip' and 'words'.)"
Genesis,11,2,"So they were traveling from the east, and they stumbled upon a cool spot in the land of Shinar, where they decided to settle down."
Genesis,11,3,"And they were like, yo, check it, let's make some bricks and roast them real good. They swapped out stone for brick, and used slime as mortar, you feel me?"
Genesis,11,4,"So they were like, 'Yo, let's build a sick city with a dope tower! It's gonna be so high, it could touch the heavens! And we'll make a name for ourselves, ya know? So we don't end up scattered everywhere on this planet.'"
Genesis,11,5,"And God, like, decided to check out this city and tower that the people were busy constructing."
Genesis,11,6,"And God was like, check it out, these people are totally united, they all speak the same language and they're working together on this project. And honestly, there's no limit to what they can achieve if they continue like this."
Genesis,11,7,"Yo, let's slide in and mix things up, making their languages all tangled so they can't even understand each other no more."
Genesis,11,8,"And then God spread them out all over the place, like, all over the earth, you know? And they totally stopped working on that city."
Genesis,11,9,"So they named it Babel because God messed with everyone's language there, and then God scattered people all over the earth."
Genesis,11,10,"This is the story of Shem: Shem was already 100 years old when he became a dad and had a son named Arphaxad, just two years after the big flood."
Genesis,11,11,"So, Shem lived for a whopping five hundred years after he became a dad to Arphaxad. And during that time, he kept on adding to his fam with more sons and daughters. Impressive, right?"
Genesis,11,12,And Arphaxad was around 35 years old when he became a dad to Salah:
Genesis,11,13,"And Arphaxad kept on living for four hundred and three years after Salah was born, and he had a bunch of sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,14,And Salah was around thirty years old when he became a dad to Eber:
Genesis,11,15,"After Salah became the father of Eber, he lived for a total of 403 years and had both sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,16,"Then Eber lived for thirty-four years and had a son named Peleg (who is also known as Phalec in Greek)."" }"
Genesis,11,17,"And Eber kept on living for a cool 430 years after he became a dad to Peleg. He also had other kiddos, both boys and girls. Talk about a full family tree!"
Genesis,11,18,Peleg was chillin' for 30 years and then he became a dad to Reu.
Genesis,11,19,"After Peleg became a dad to Reu, he kept living for another 209 years and had a bunch of kids, both boys and girls."
Genesis,11,20,"And Reu lived for 32 years and became the father of Serug, whose Greek name is Saruch."
Genesis,11,21,"And Reu was like, totally around for a cool 207 years after he had Serug, and during that time, he had both sons and daughters. The fam was growing, you know!"
Genesis,11,22,"Then Serug was living his best life for thirty years, and he became the proud parent of Nahor:"
Genesis,11,23,"And Serug, like, lived for another two hundred years after he became a dad to this dude Nahor, and he, like, had a bunch of sons and daughters, man!"
Genesis,11,24,And Nahor was 29 years old when he became the father of Terah. (Terah's Gr. name is Thara)
Genesis,11,25,"And Nahor was alive for 119 years after he became a dad to Terah. During that time, he had both sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,26,"So, Terah was around seventy years old when he became a proud dad to Abram, Nahor, and Haran."
Genesis,11,27,"This is the fam tree of Terah: Terah had three kids: Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran had a son named Lot."
Genesis,11,28,"And Haran passed away before his dad Terah in the place where he was born, in Ur of the Chaldeans."
Genesis,11,29,"So, Abram and Nahor got themselves wives. Abram's wife was named Sarai, and Nahor's wife was named Milcah. Milcah was the daughter of Haran, who was the father of Milcah and Iscah."
Genesis,11,30,But Sarai couldn't have kids. She didn't have any children.
Genesis,11,31,"So Terah was like, 'Let's go, fam!' He took his son Abram, his grandson Lot (Haran's son), and his daughter-in-law Sarai (who was married to Abram). They all left Ur of the Chaldees and were heading to Canaan. Along the way, they stopped and settled in Haran."
Genesis,11,32,"So Terah lived for 205 years, and then he passed away in Haran.""}"
Genesis,12,1,"So, God was like, 'Abram, you gotta leave your hometown, your fam, and your dad's place and go to a new land that I'll show you.'"
Genesis,12,2,"And I will turn you into an awesome nation, bless you, and make your name famous; so that you'll be a total blessing."
Genesis,12,3,"And anyone who supports and shows kindness towards you, I will bring blessings into their lives. But those who oppose and speak ill of you, I will bring upon them negativity and hardships. Through you, all the people of the Earth will receive bountiful blessings."
Genesis,12,4,"So, Abram bounced, just like the LORD told him to. And Lot tagged along too. Abram was 75 years old when he dipped out of Haran."
Genesis,12,5,"So, Abram brings along his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, and all their stuff that they had collected, including the people they had acquired in Haran. And off they go to the land of Canaan, and sure enough, they arrive in Canaan."
Genesis,12,6,"So Abram traveled through the land until he reached Sichem, which was a chill spot in the plain of Moreh. It's worth mentioning that the Canaanite peeps were living there at that time, just so you know."
Genesis,12,7,"So, God showed up to Abram and was like, 'Yo, this land is gonna be all yours, and to your descendants too.' And then Abram was like, Wordd!' And he built an altar to honor God, who had just shown Himself to Abram."
Genesis,12,8,"Then he moved to a mountain east of Bethel and set up camp, with Bethel on the west and Hai on the east. There, he built an altar to honor the LORD and called upon His name."
Genesis,12,9,"So Abram kept on moving, continuing his journey towards the south. #travelgoals"
Genesis,12,10,"So, like, there was a huge food shortage in the land, and Abram was like, 'Well, gotta find a new spot to chill.' So he went down to Egypt to stay there for a while, because the famine was pretty awful, ya know?"
Genesis,12,11,"And when they were about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, 'Look, babe, I can't help but notice you're a total hottie.'"
Genesis,12,12,"So, like, when the Egyptians see you, they'll be all like, 'That's his wife!', but, uh, they're totally gonna try to kill me, but don't worry, they'll spare you."
Genesis,12,13,"Yo, can you just go along with the whole 'you're my sister' thing? It'll be better for both of us. And trust me, my life will be so much better thanks to you."
Genesis,12,14,"So, like, Abram went to Egypt, and the Egyptians saw that the woman was, like, super attractive."
Genesis,12,15,"The peeps who were in charge under Pharaoh noticed her, and they were like, 'Wow, she's pretty cool!' So they brought her to Pharaoh's crib."
Genesis,12,16,"And he treated Abram really well because of her, and he had tons of cool stuff like sheep, oxen, donkeys, guys who worked for him, girls who worked for him, and even more donkeys and camels."
Genesis,12,17,"And God really messed up Pharaoh and his fam with some serious troubles all because of Sarai, who was Abram's wifey."
Genesis,12,18,"So Pharaoh hit up Abram and was like, 'Bro, what's the deal with this move you pulled on me? Why didn't you let me know she was your wife?'"" }"
Genesis,12,19,"Why'd you lie and say she's my sis? If you'd just told the truth, I could've married her. But hey, here's your wifey, you can have her back now. Peace out."
Genesis,12,20,"And Pharaoh was like, yo, tell all his crew to bounce. So they sent him, his wifey, and all his stuff on their way.""}"
Genesis,13,1,"So Abram, his wife, and everything they had, along with Lot, went up to the south after leaving Egypt."
Genesis,13,2,"Abram had, like, a ton of cows, plus he had stacks of silver and gold."
Genesis,13,3,"So he traveled from the south to Bethel, to the same spot where his tent had been at the start, between Bethel and Hai."
Genesis,13,4,And Abram went back to where he had set up the altar before and called on the name of the LORD.
Genesis,13,5,"And Lot was with Abram, and he had a bunch of animals, like flocks and herds, and he lived in tents too."
Genesis,13,6,The land couldn't handle both of them living together because they had so much stuff and there just wasn't enough space.
Genesis,13,7,"So, like, there was some drama going on between the ranch guys who took care of Abram's cows and the ones who took care of Lot's cows. And just to add to the mix, the Canaanite and Perizzite homies were also living in that same area at the time."
Genesis,13,8,"Abram was like, yo Lot, let's not get into any unnecessary drama between us or our crew. We're fam, bro."
Genesis,13,9,"Hey, you see this whole place around us? Can you do me a solid favor and go your own way? If you wanna go left, cool, I'll take the right. And if you wanna head right, that's fine too, I'll just go left. No hard feelings!"
Genesis,13,10,"So, like, Lot looked out and saw this totally well-watered place called the plain of Jordan. It was all lush and green, kind of like a beautiful garden or even the land of Egypt. This was before God wiped out Sodom and Gomorrah, by the way. And it stretched all the way to this place called Zoar."
Genesis,13,11,"So Lot picked the whole cool area near the Jordan River, and he went on a journey towards the east. That's when they decided to go their separate ways."
Genesis,13,12,"Abram was living in Canaan, and Lot was living in the cities of the plain, and set up his tent facing Sodom."
Genesis,13,13,"But yo, the dudes in Sodom were straight up evil and sinners, no cap, like mega bad in the eyes of the LORD."
Genesis,13,14,"And God was like, 'Yo Abram, now that Lot dipped and it's just you, peep this: Look around you, bro! Look all the way to the north, south, east, and west.'"
Genesis,13,15,"Check it out, everything you lay your eyes on, it's all yours! And not just for you, but for all your future generations too, forever!"
Genesis,13,16,And I'll make your descendants so numerous like the dust on the ground that no one can even count! They'll be as uncountable as the grains of sand on a beach.
Genesis,13,17,"Yo, get up and start exploring this place, from one end to the other. I'm gonna hook you up with all of it."
Genesis,13,18,"After that, Abram packed up his tent and moved to the chill spot in Mamre, which is in Hebron. He decided to set up a dope altar there to show love and respect to the LORD.""}"
Genesis,14,1,"Back in the day when Amraphel was ruling over Shinar, Arioch was the king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer was the big shot king of Elam, and Tidal was the king who ruled over everyone else."
Genesis,14,2,"So, like, these dudes totally went to war against Bera, the king of Sodom, and Birsha, the king of Gomorrah, and Shinab, the king of Admah, and Shemeber, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar."
Genesis,14,3,"All these homies were chillin' together in the spot called Siddim, which is the salt sea, you know."
Genesis,14,4,"So, like, for a solid twelve years, they totally did whatever Chedorlaomer wanted and stuff. But then, in the thirteenth year, they were like, 'nah, we're not about that anymore,' and started rebelling against him."
Genesis,14,5,"In the fourteenth year, Chedorlaomer and his crew rolled up and totally wrecked the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, took down the Zuzims in Ham, and crushed the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim. (Shaveh means ""plain"" by the way, just so you know)"
Genesis,14,6,"And the Horites lived in their mountain Seir, until they reached Elparan, which is near the wilderness. (Elparan can also be called the plain of Paran.)"
Genesis,14,7,"So they went back and arrived at Enmishpat, which is called Kadesh. They totally crushed all the Amalekites and the Amorites who were living in Hazezontamar."
Genesis,14,8,"Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (also known as Zoar) all decided to have a big fight in the valley of Siddim."
Genesis,14,9,"So there were these four kings, Chedorlaomer from Elam, Tidal from a bunch of nations, Amraphel from Shinar, and Arioch from Ellasar. And they were up against five other kings. It was a real clash of titans!"
Genesis,14,10,"So, like, the whole area of Siddim was, like, filled with these gross slimepits and stuff. And the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah, they ran away and ended up falling into them, and the others who were left behind, they tried to escape to the mountains."
Genesis,14,11,"So they grabbed all the swag from Sodom and Gomorrah, including their snacks, and dipped out."
Genesis,14,12,"So, like, they grabbed Lot, who's Abram's nephew, you know? And he was living in Sodom at the time. They also took all his stuff and then left."
Genesis,14,13,"So there was this person who managed to get away and they went and told Abram the Hebrew. Abram was living in the plain of Mamre, along with his friends Eshcol and Aner, who were Amorites. They were all really tight with Abram, like a crew."
Genesis,14,14,"When Abram found out that his brother got kidnapped, he gathered his skilled squad, all homies born in his crib, a total of 318 peeps, and chased after the kidnappers until they reached Dan. (armed: or, took charge of) (trained: or, schooled)"
Genesis,14,15,"So, like, he split up with his crew and went all sneak mode on them in the middle of the night. He straight up attacked them, then kept chasing after them all the way to Hobah, which is, like, on the left side of Damascus."
Genesis,14,16,"So, he ended up recovering all the stuff, and he also managed to bring back his bro Lot, along with his possessions, the women, and all the people too."
Genesis,14,17,"So, like, the king of Sodom came out to meet him after he came back from defeating Chedorlaomer and the other kings who were with him, at this place called the valley of Shaveh, which is, like, the king's valley."
Genesis,14,18,"Then Melchizedek, the king of Salem, came out with some bread and wine. He was actually serving as a priest of God Almighty."
Genesis,14,19,"And he's like, yo, blessed AF is Abram, like seriously blessed by the most high God, the boss of heaven and earth, bro:"
Genesis,14,20,"Shout out to the Most High God, who totally handed your enemies to you. And guess what? You hooked Him up with a sick 10% of all the spoils!"
Genesis,14,21,"The king of Sodom was like, 'Yo Abram, hook me up with the people, and you can keep all the stuff.' (By peoplee' he means souls, ya know.)"
Genesis,14,22,"And Abram was like, yo king of Sodom, listen up. I swear on the name of the LORD, who's like, the super OG God, ruler of the whole dang universe, heaven and earth and all that."
Genesis,14,23,"I promise not to take even a single thread or shoelace from you, and I won't accept anything that belongs to you. I don't want you to think that you made me rich."
Genesis,14,24,"Just make sure the stuff that the squad and I, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, had already chowed down on, don't touch that. Let them have their share.""}"
Genesis,15,1,"So, like, after all that stuff went down, the word of the LORD came to Abram in, like, a vision, saying, 'Don't stress, Abram! I've got your back, dude. I'm gonna hook you up with, like, the biggest reward ever!'"
Genesis,15,2,"And Abram was like, 'Yo Lord GOD, I'm keepin' it real here. What's the dealio? I ain't got no kids of my own, and this dude Eliezer from Damascus is basically runnin' the show at my crib. What's up with that?'"
Genesis,15,3,"And Abram was like, yo, I gotta be real with you, God. Like, I don't have any kids of my own, and this dude Eliezer, who was born in my house, is gonna inherit all my stuff. Help a bro out, God."
Genesis,15,4,"Yo, guess what? The big man upstairs dropped a message, saying that your heir won't be the one you think, but someone who's actually blood-related to you."
Genesis,15,5,"Then he took him outside and said, 'Yo, check out the sky. Try counting all them stars if you can. And he told him, 'That's how many descendants you're gonna have, yo.'"" }"
Genesis,15,6,"And he totally trusted in the LORD; and the LORD was like, 'That's some real righteousness right there.'"" }"
Genesis,15,7,"And he's like, 'Dude, I'm totally the LORD who saved you from Ur of the Chaldees just so you could get this land and own it, you know?'"
Genesis,15,8,"And, like, he's asking, Lord GOD, how can I be sure that I'll totally inherit it?"
Genesis,15,9,"Yo, he told him, grab a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old she goat, a three-year-old ram, and also a turtledove and a young pigeon."
Genesis,15,10,"Then he collected all of them and split them in half, placing each piece next to each other. However, he didn't split the birds."
Genesis,15,11,"And when the birds showed up and started feasting on the dead bodies, Abram scared them away."
Genesis,15,12,"As the sun was setting, Abram suddenly felt really tired and dozed off. Then, out of nowhere, a super intense feeling of darkness and fear overcame him."
Genesis,15,13,"And he said to Abram, like, listen up, dude. Just so you know, your descendants are gonna be living as outsiders in a land that ain't even theirs. They'll be serving those peeps and going through some tough times, like, for a solid four hundred years."
Genesis,15,14,"And that nation they'll serve, I'll totally judge them. But after that, they'll come out with amazing wealth and all."
Genesis,15,15,And you will peacefully join your ancestors; you'll be laid to rest at a ripe old age with respect.
Genesis,15,16,"But it will take four generations for them to come back here, because the Amorites haven't reached their full wrongdoing yet."
Genesis,15,17,"And as the sun went down and it got dark, something amazing happened – there appeared a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that moved between those pieces. The lamp was like a fire!"
Genesis,15,18,"On that day, God made a deal with Abram, like a solid agreement, you know? He was all like, 'I'm handing over this land to your descendants, from one side of Egypt's river to the mighty Euphrates river!' No Cap."
Genesis,15,19,"There were these cool groups called the Kenites, Kenizzites, and Kadmonites,"
Genesis,15,20,"And there were also the Hitties, the Perizzies, and the Rephaim people,"
Genesis,15,21,"And then there were the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.""}"
Genesis,16,1,"So, like, Sarai, who was Abram's wife, couldn't have any kids of her own. But she had this handmaid, who was Egyptian, and her name was Hagar. Just FYI."
Genesis,16,2,"So Sarai was like, yo Abram, God has stopped me from getting pregnant. So, like, can you be with my maid? Maybe I can have kids through her. And Abram was like, okay, I'll do what you say, Sarai."
Genesis,16,3,"So, like, Sarai, who's Abram's wife, she, like, took Hagar, who's her maid and also, like, from Egypt? This happened after Abram had been living in Canaan for ten years, you know? And Sarai gave Hagar to Abram, like, as his wife and stuff."
Genesis,16,4,"So, he got with Hagar, and she ended up getting pregnant. And when she realized she was pregnant, she started disrespecting her mistress."
Genesis,16,5,"And Sarai was like, 'Abram, this whole situation is on you, man. I gave you my servant to have a child with and now she's acting all high and mighty because she's pregnant. God better step in and be the judge between us.'"" }"
Genesis,16,6,"But Abram told Sarai, 'Look, Hagar is under your authority, so treat her as you see fit.' Unfortunately, when Sarai mistreated Hagar, she decided to run away from her."
Genesis,16,7,"So, like, the angel of the LORD spotted her chilling by a totally cool water fountain in the middle of nowhere, on the way to Shur."
Genesis,16,8,"And he was like, hey Hagar, Sarai's assistant, where did you come from? And where are you headed? And she was like, dude, I'm running away from Sarai because she's driving me crazy."
Genesis,16,9,"Then the angel of the LORD said to her, 'Go back to your boss lady and humble yourself under her authority.'"
Genesis,16,10,"And the angel of the LORD was like, 'Yo, I gotta tell you something amazing. Your descendants are gonna be so many, like, impossible to count!"
Genesis,16,11,"Then the LORD's angel was like, hey, listen up! You're gonna have a baby boy and his name's gonna be Ishmael. Why? 'Cause God totally heard your sufferings, girl. (Ishmael means God shall hear, just so you know.)"
Genesis,16,12,"And he's gonna be like, a total rebel, always clashing with people and everyone clashing with him too. It's like he's destined to live in constant conflict with his fam."
Genesis,16,13,"Then she called the LORD who talked to her, and said, 'Dude, you totally see me, right? I mean, I've been looking out for this guy who can see me, too. It's crazy, right?'"
Genesis,16,14,"So they named the well Beerlahairoi, because, like, it's located between Kadesh and Bered. Beerlahairoi means, like, 'The well of the one who is alive and sees me,' you know?"
Genesis,16,15,"So, Hagar gave birth to a son for Abram, and Abram named his son Ishmael, just as Hagar had given birth to him."
Genesis,16,16,"Abram was 86 years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael, fam.""}"
Genesis,17,1,"So when Abram was 99 years old, God showed up and said to him, 'I'm the Almighty God, yo! Live your life just right in front of me and be real, like, sincere and all.'"
Genesis,17,2,"And I'll totally establish a super solid agreement between us, like, you and me, and I'll make your descendants grow like crazy, seriously!"
Genesis,17,3,"And Abram was like, woah, and he totally fell on his face, and then God was like, 'Sup, bro?' and started chatting with him, saying,"
Genesis,17,4,"As for me, listen up, I've got a deal with you. You'll become a dad to a whole bunch of nations. Like, seriously, a whole multitude of nations!"
Genesis,17,5,"Dude, from now on you won't be called Abram anymore. Your new name is Abraham, because I've made you the father of many nations. Abraham means Fatherr of a great multitude', just so you know."
Genesis,17,6,I'll make you super successful and you'll give birth to whole nations. Future rulers will actually come from you!
Genesis,17,7,"And, like, I'm gonna make this super legit deal with you and your future peeps that will last forever. You'll have me as your ultimate homie, and your descendants will too."
Genesis,17,8,"And I'll hook you up, and your descendants too, with the land where you're currently just chillin', all of Canaan, as an ownership that lasts forever. Oh, and BTW, I'll be their God, no cap. {wherein...: Hebrew for the place where you're temporarily staying}"" }"
Genesis,17,9,"And God was like, Abrahamm, dude, you gotta stick with my covenant. Like, you and your future fam gotta keep it going for generations to come.'"" }"
Genesis,17,10,"Yo, listen up fam. This is the deal: I'm makin' a covenant with you and your descendants. Every male in your crew gotta get circumcised, no exceptions."
Genesis,17,11,"So like, you gotta, um, cut off the excess skin from your... you know, private area. And that's gonna symbolize the special agreement between me and you, got it?"
Genesis,17,12,"On the eighth day, all male children among you, whether they are born in your house or bought from a non-relative, must be circumcised. This applies to every generation. The term sonn of eight days' is used in Hebrew to refer to an infant who is eight days old."
Genesis,17,13,"If someone is born into your fam or if you bought them, they gotta get circumcised. And my covenant will always be in your bodies as an everlasting covenant."
Genesis,17,14,"If a guy is not circumcised, he's not part of the crew. He's straight up breaking our agreement, so he's gotta peace out from the clique."
Genesis,17,15,"God told Abraham, yo, listen up, Sarai ain't gonna be her name no more. From now on, she's gonna be called Sarah, ya feel me? And just so you know, Sarah means Princess, that's what's up."
Genesis,17,16,"And I'm gonna hook Sarah up real good. She's gonna have a son, you feel me? Not only that, but I'm gonna bless her and she's gonna birth nations. Like, legit, kings are gonna come from her, man. It's gonna be epic."
Genesis,17,17,"Abraham straight up face-planted and cracked up. He was like, for real though, can a super old dude like me even have a kid? And Sarah, at ninety years old, gonna give birth? That's wild!"
Genesis,17,18,"And Abraham was like, yo God, I'm hoping that Ishmael gets to live in your presence!"
Genesis,17,19,"And God was like, yo, Abraham, your wifey Sarah is gonna have a legit son, for real. And you gotta name him Isaac. Oh, and I'm gonna make a super tight covenant with him, like forever and ever, and with all his future fam, it's gonna be lit."
Genesis,17,20,"Yo, about Ishmael, I got you covered. Check it out, I have blessed him big time and he's gonna have mad descendants, like a ton of 'em. He'll even be the father of twelve rulers and I'm gonna make his nation hella strong."
Genesis,17,21,"But here's the deal: I'm gonna make my special promise with Isaac, the son that Sarah's gonna have for you around this time next year."
Genesis,17,22,"And then they finished their convo, and God bounced from Abraham's crib."
Genesis,17,23,"So Abraham gathered up Ishmael, his son, along with all his household members and those he had acquired with his money. They were all males who belonged to Abraham's household. And on that very day, they all underwent circumcision, just as God had instructed him to do."
Genesis,17,24,"Abraham was like, super old, man, like ninety-nine years old, when he got circumcised. Yeah, his foreskin was beast-mode removed and all that."
Genesis,17,25,Ishmael was just a cool 13-year-old when he got circumcised and went through that snip procedure.
Genesis,17,26,"On that very day, Abraham got circumcised along with his son Ishmael."
Genesis,17,27,"And all the dudes in his crib, born there or bought from overseas, got circumcised together.""}"
Genesis,18,1,"So, like, the LORD showed up to him in this chill place called Mamre. And this dude was just chilling in his tent entrance, feeling that scorching heat of the day, you know? (BTW, Mamre means 'plains' in Hebrew, just so you're in the know.)"
Genesis,18,2,"And he looked up and saw three dudes hanging out, so he hurried over to meet them from the entrance of his tent and respectfully bowed down."
Genesis,18,3,"And I was like, 'Yo, Lord, if you vibe with me, please don't bounce, I'm beggin' ya, stay with me, hear my plea:'"
Genesis,18,4,"Yo, could ya please grab some water real quick and wash your feet? Then feel free to chill and take a break under the tree."
Genesis,18,5,"I'll get you some bread to cheer you up and give you strength, then you can continue on your journey. That's why you came to me, right? And they agreed, saying, ""Yeah, sure, do what you said."""
Genesis,18,6,"So Abraham quickly went into the tent where Sarah was and said, 'Hey Sarah, can you get ready fast and prepare three measures of fine meal? Knead it and make some cakes on the hearth.'"
Genesis,18,7,So Abraham quickly went to his herd and got a young and fresh calf. He gave it to one of his young dudes and they hurried to prepare it for a meal.
Genesis,18,8,"Then he brought some butter, milk, and the deliciously prepared calf and placed it in front of them. He stood beside them under the tree while they enjoyed their meal."
Genesis,18,9,"And they were like, 'Yo, where's Sarah, your wifey?' And he was like, 'Check it, she's chillin' in the tent.'"" }"
Genesis,18,10,"And he was like, 'Bro, I'm definitely coming back to you when the time is right. And guess what? Sarah, your wifey, is gonna have a baby boy!' And Sarah was eavesdropping from inside the tent, all sneaky like."
Genesis,18,11,"So like, Abraham and Sarah were really old, like ancient, you know? And Sarah couldn't have babies anymore, like she couldn't have periods. It was, like, not possible for her to get pregnant."
Genesis,18,12,"So Sarah couldn't help but laugh to herself and said, 'Seriously, am I supposed to find pleasure in my old age when my husband is just as old?'"" }"
Genesis,18,13,"And God was like, Abrahamm, seriously, why did Sarah laugh and doubt that she could have a baby when she's old?'"
Genesis,18,14,"Like, seriously, is anything too difficult for the LORD? I mean, at the right time, I'll totally come back to you, just like when everything's blooming and awesome, and Sarah will totally give birth to a son, no doubt about it."
Genesis,18,15,"Sarah was like, 'Nah, I didn't laugh!' She was scared, you know? But then he goes, 'Nuh-uh, you totally laughed!'"
Genesis,18,16,"So, the guys got up and checked out what was happening in Sodom. And Abraham tagged along to guide them."
Genesis,18,17,"So God was like, should I keep this thing I'm about to do a secret from Abraham or what?"
Genesis,18,18,"Yo, check it out. The big man upstairs promised Abraham that his crew was gonna blow up and become a legit powerhouse, you know, a sick nation. And get this, not only that, but everyone from all around the globe would be blessed because of him. Pretty dope, right?"
Genesis,18,19,"I totally know that Abraham is gonna be all about making sure his kids and household follow the Lord's teachings, doing what's right and fair. And because of that, the Lord will totally make sure Abraham gets all the awesome blessings He promised him."
Genesis,18,20,"And God was like, yo, the noise comin' from Sodom and Gomorrah is off the charts, and their actions are seriously messed up."
Genesis,18,21,"I'm gonna check it out for myself, see if they're really doing what I've heard. And if not, I'll find out the truth."
Genesis,18,22,"And the dudes were like, Peacee out!' and headed towards Sodom, but Abraham stayed chill, still chilling with the LORD."
Genesis,18,23,"Abraham came forward and asked, like yo, are you gonna wipe out the good peeps along with the wicked ones?"
Genesis,18,24,"Yo, suppose there's like fifty righteous peeps in that city. Would you even wreck the whole place, not sparing it for the sake of those fifty righteous homies living there?"
Genesis,18,25,"God, it's not cool at all for you to treat the righteous and the wicked the same. You definitely wouldn't want to go around smiting righteous people along with the wicked ones, right? The Judge of everyone surely knows how to do what's fair, don't they?"
Genesis,18,26,"God was like, 'Yo, if I come across fifty chill and righteous people in Sodom, I'll save the whole city just for them.'"" }"
Genesis,18,27,"And Abraham was like, yo, listen up, I'm about to talk to the Big Guy up there, even though I'm just a tiny speck of dirt and dust."
Genesis,18,28,"Yo, what if there's only five righteous peeps missing from the 50? You gonna wipe out the whole city just cuz of five? And then he's like, nah if I find 45 righteous peeps, I won't destroy it."
Genesis,18,29,"Then he talked to him again and said, 'Maybe if there are like forty people there, will you save the place?' And he replied, 'Nah fam, even if there were forty, I'm not doing it for their sake.'"" }"
Genesis,18,30,"And he's like, 'Yo, chill, don't get mad, but hear me out. Maybe there's like, 30 good people there.' And the other dude's like, 'Nah man, even if there are 30, I ain't gonna do it.'"" }"
Genesis,18,31,"And he was like, yo, I'm gonna talk to the big boss, the Lord. Maybe, just maybe, if there's like, twenty good people in there, the whole place won't get wrecked."
Genesis,18,32,"And the guy was like, please don't get mad, Lord. I just wanna say one more thing. Maybe if there's like ten good people there, you won't destroy the place, right?"
Genesis,18,33,"And God went on his way, soon after having finished talking with Abraham. And Abraham went back to where he was.""}"
Genesis,19,1,"So, like, two angels showed up in Sodom one evening, and Lot was chilling at the gate. When he saw them, he got up and went to greet them, showing mad respect by bowing down with his face to the ground."
Genesis,19,2,"And he was like, yo dudes, why don't you come chill at my crib for the night? You can crash, freshen up, and bounce early in the morning. But they were like, nah man, we're down to stay out in the streets for the night."
Genesis,19,3,"He really insisted, so they finally agreed and went to his place. He threw them an awesome party, cooking up some delicious unleavened bread that they all enjoyed."
Genesis,19,4,"But before they went to bed, all the guys from the city, like literally everyone from Sodom, gathered around the house. It was a mix of old and young, and they came from all over the place."
Genesis,19,5,"So, like, these people were calling out to Lot and asking him, 'Yo, where are those dudes who came to hang with you tonight? Bring 'em out so we can get to know them.'"" }"
Genesis,19,6,So Lot came out of the crib and closed the door behind him.
Genesis,19,7,"Yo, fam, I'm just sayin', please, don't be doing that wicked stuff."
Genesis,19,8,"Listen up, fam! I've got two daughters who haven't been with anyone, so how 'bout I bring them out to y'all, and you can do whatever you think is right. Just don't lay a finger on these guys, 'cause they're under my protection, yo."
Genesis,19,9,"And they were like, 'Yo, step aside!' And they were like, 'This dude just showed up in town and now he wants to be all judgy. We're gonna treat you even worse than those other peeps!' And they started hella pressuring Lot, getting all up in his face, almost breaking down the door."
Genesis,19,10,"The guys grabbed Lot and brought him inside, then quickly closed the door."
Genesis,19,11,"And they totally blinded the guys at the entrance of the house, like everyone, young and old. It was so crazy that they were like super tired from trying to find the door."
Genesis,19,12,"The guys were like, 'Hey Lot, do you have anyone else here? Like, your son-in-law, sons, daughters, or whatever else you have in the city? Get them out of here, man.'"
Genesis,19,13,"We're gonna wreck this place, 'cause their cries have gotten way too loud in front of the LORD, and He's sent us to demolish it."
Genesis,19,14,"Then Lot went to talk to his sons-in-law, who were married to his daughters, and he said, 'Hey, you guys need to leave this city ASAP! The Lord is gonna wreck this place.' But his sons-in-law thought he was just playing around and didn't take him seriously."
Genesis,19,15,"And when morning came, the angels quickly told Lot, 'Wake up, dude! Grab your wife and your two daughters who are here, before you get caught up in the city's messed up ways and face the consequences. {are here: Found them, seriously} {iniquity: or, punishment}"
Genesis,19,16,"And as he hesitated, the guys grabbed his hand, along with the hands of his wife and two daughters, because the Lord was being merciful to him. They led him out and placed him outside the city."
Genesis,19,17,"Suddenly, when they finally got outside, he said, 'Dude, you need to bounce and save your own skin. Don't even glance backwards, and don't waste any time in this whole area. Head for the mountains ASAP, otherwise you'll be totally wrecked.'"
Genesis,19,18,"And Lot was like, um, hold up, fam, nah, my Lord:"
Genesis,19,19,"Yo, listen up! Your servant here, I gotta say, you've been super kind to me. Your mercy has been off the charts, especially when you saved my life. But here's the thing, running to the mountains ain't gonna cut it. I'm afraid some bad stuff might go down and I won't make it out alive."
Genesis,19,20,"Yo, check it out, this town is hella close to bounce to, and it's not even big: Yo, lemme dip there, it's lowkey small, right? And if I do, I'll be livin' my best life."
Genesis,19,21,"And he was like, yo, I'm totally down with what you're saying. I won't wreck this city you're talkin' about. Your vibes are accepted, my dude."
Genesis,19,22,"Quick, get out of here ASAP! I can't do anything until you reach that place. That's why the city was named Zoar, which means 'Little'."
Genesis,19,23,"When Lot entered Zoar, the sun had already come up. {gone forth: Hebrew for risen}"
Genesis,19,24,"Then God straight up dropped fire and brimstone from the sky onto Sodom and Gomorrah; like, it was intense."
Genesis,19,25,"And like, he totally wiped out those cities, along with all the surrounding area and everyone living there, including all the crops and stuff."
Genesis,19,26,"But his wife, like, totally turned around and peeked back, and she, like, instantly turned into a giant salt statue."
Genesis,19,27,And Abraham got up early in the morning and went to the same spot where he had stood before the LORD:
Genesis,19,28,"He checked out Sodom and Gomorrah, along with all the other cities in the area, and saw that they were in ruins. Smoke rose from the land, billowing like smoke from a giant furnace."
Genesis,19,29,"So, like, when God was wrecking those cities in the plain, He remembered Abraham and made sure Lot got out of there before the whole place went down. Lot was living in one of those cities, you know."
Genesis,19,30,"So Lot bounced outta Zoar and moved to the mountains with his two daughters. He was too freaked out to stay in Zoar, so they bunked in a cave together."
Genesis,19,31,"The older sibling said to the younger one, 'Listen, our dad is getting up there in age, and there's literally no one else in the entire world for us to find a future partner like everyone else does.'"
Genesis,19,32,"Yo, let's get dad drunk and sleep with him so that we can keep his bloodline going."
Genesis,19,33,"And, like, they totally got their dad to drink wine that night. And then, the oldest sibling went in and slept with their dad. And, like, he didn't even realize when she lay down or when she got up."
Genesis,19,34,"The next day, the eldest sibling said to the younger one, 'Listen up, bro. Last night, I slept with our dad. Let's get him drunk again tonight and you can do the same thing. That way, we can keep our family bloodline going.'"
Genesis,19,35,"That night, they got their dad to have some wine too. The youngest one got up and slept with him, and he didn't even realize when she got in or got out of bed."
Genesis,19,36,"{ ""translation"": ""Both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their own father."" }"
Genesis,19,37,"The oldest child had a son and named him Moab, who ended up being the ancestor of the Moabites, even till now."
Genesis,19,38,"And the younger sister also had a baby boy and named him Benammi. He later became the ancestor of the Ammonite people to this very day.""}"
Genesis,20,1,"So Abraham peaced out from there and headed to the southern region, chillin' between Kadesh and Shur, and crashed in Gerar for a bit."
Genesis,20,2,"So Abraham was like, 'Sarah is my sister, bro!' And then Abimelech, the king of Gerar, was like, 'No way, dude!' So he sent for Sarah and took her into his crib."
Genesis,20,3,"One night, God appeared to Abimelech in a dream and gave him a serious warning. He said, 'Hey, just so you know, you're in big trouble because the woman you took is actually married to someone else. You're as good as dead.'"
Genesis,20,4,"Abimelech didn't do anything with her, and he was like, yo Lord, you gonna destroy an innocent crew too?"
Genesis,20,5,"Didn't he tell me that she's my sis? And even she herself said that he's my bro. I swear, deep down in my heart, I didn't mean any harm. I did it with pure intentions and clean hands."
Genesis,20,6,"So like, God comes to him in a dream and is all, 'Yeah, I totally know that you did this with pure intentions in your heart. And like, I made sure you didn't sin against me by stopping you from getting close to her.'"
Genesis,20,7,"So like, give the guy back his wife, bro. He's, like, a prophet and he'll pray for you and you'll live. But if you don't give her back, just know that you'll totally die, and everyone you know too, man."
Genesis,20,8,"So Abimelech got up really early, gathered all his homies, and spilled the tea to them: and the squad was shook to their core."
Genesis,20,9,"So, Abimelech hit up Abraham and was like, 'Yo, what did you do to us? Did I do something to offend you or what? You brought a major vibe of sin upon me and my kingdom. The stuff you did, man, it was not cool at all.'"
Genesis,20,10,"Abimelech straight up asked Abraham, like, what did you see that made you do this?"
Genesis,20,11,"Abraham was like, yo, I had this thought, you know? I was thinking, for real though, I don't think these people here even know what it means to respect God, so I was legit scared they might straight up kill me just to take my wifey."
Genesis,20,12,"TBH, she's technically my sister. Like, same dad but different mom, ya know? And then we ended up getting hitched."
Genesis,20,13,"So, like, when God made me leave my dad's place and stuff, I told her, 'This is how you gotta have my back. Whenever we're in a new place, just say that I'm your bro, alright?'"
Genesis,20,14,"So, like, Abimelech was all generous and gave Abraham a bunch of sheep, oxen, male servants, and female servants. And, get this, he even returned Abraham's wife Sarah to him!"
Genesis,20,15,"And Abimelech was like, hey bro, check it out, my turf is all yours. Settle wherever you vibe the most, you know. (No pressure, do what feels right, man)."
Genesis,20,16,"So Sarah, listen up, I hooked your brother up with a thousand silver coins. He's like your backup and protection, shielding you and everyone else around you. This was a lesson for her to learn from."
Genesis,20,17,"So Abraham hit up God with a prayer, and God came through in a major way, healing Abimelech, his wife, and even his crew. And guess what? They all started poppin' out kids like no tomorrow."
Genesis,20,18,"So like, God made it so none of the ladies in Abimelech's fam could get pregnant, all because my boy Abraham's wife Sarah was part of the picture.""}"
Genesis,21,1,"And then God took care of Sarah, just like he promised, and did exactly what he said he would do."
Genesis,21,2,"So, like, Sarah got pregnant and gave birth to a son for Abraham when he was super old, just as God had said it would happen."
Genesis,21,3,"Abraham gave his son, who was born to him by Sarah, the name Isaac."
Genesis,21,4,"So, like, Abraham did what God told him to do and circumcised his son Isaac when he was just 8 days old."
Genesis,21,5,"Abraham was, like, a whole hundred years old when his son Isaac finally made an appearance in his life."
Genesis,21,6,"And Sarah was like, OMG, God made me laugh so hard that anyone who hears about it will laugh with me."
Genesis,21,7,"And she was like, who would've ever thought that Sarah, at her old age, would be breastfeeding a baby? But she did, she gave birth to a son for Abraham."
Genesis,21,8,"And the baby grew up and was no longer nursing. So, Abraham threw a massive party on the very day Isaac stopped nursing."
Genesis,21,9,"And Sarah peeped the son of Hagar the Egyptian, who she birthed for Abraham, throwing shade."
Genesis,21,10,"So she was like, Abraham, you gotta kick out this bondwoman and her son. Like, they can't be heirs with my son Isaac."
Genesis,21,11,"And Abraham was really upset about it because of his son, like it was a big deal."
Genesis,21,12,"And yo, God was like, Abraham, don't stress over this situation with your son and his mama. Listen up to everything Sarah's telling you, 'cause Isaac is the one who's gonna carry on your legacy."
Genesis,21,13,"And I'll also make a whole nation out of the son of the servant woman, because he's part of your fam."
Genesis,21,14,"Abraham woke up hella early in the morning and grabbed some bread and a bottle of water. He gave it to Hagar, and she put it on her shoulder along with the child. Then, he sent her away and she dipped, wandering in the wilderness of Beersheba."
Genesis,21,15,"And the water ran out in the bottle, so she put the baby under one of the bushes."
Genesis,21,16,"So she went and sat down nearby, keeping a distance like the length of an arrow shot, because she didn't want to witness the child's passing. She positioned herself across from him, raised her voice, and began to cry."
Genesis,21,17,"And God totally heard the boy's voice; and the angel of God hit up Hagar from the skies, and was like, 'What's going on, Hagar? Don't trip; God heard the boy's voice wherever he's at.'"
Genesis,21,18,"Yo, get up, grab the kid, and keep him close; 'cause I'm gonna make him the leader of a dope nation."
Genesis,21,19,"God like totally helped her see, and she spotted a dope well with water. She went over, filled up the bottle with water, and hooked the kid up with a refreshing drink."
Genesis,21,20,"And God was chillin' with the dude; and he grew up, and lived in the wild, and became a total beast at archery."
Genesis,21,21,"So, like, he lived in this place called the wilderness of Paran, right? And then, his mom, she got him a wife from Egypt. Totally cool, right?"
Genesis,21,22,"So, like, at that time, Abimelech and Phichol, the head honcho of his peeps, they came up to Abraham and were all like, 'Yo dude, God is totally chillin' with you in everything you do.'"" }"
Genesis,21,23,"So, like, promise me right now, with God as the witness, that you won't be shady with me or my fam. Keep it real and show me the same love and kindness I've shown you in return. And, you know, be cool with the place you've been crashing at too, alright? Don't front on me, fam!"
Genesis,21,24,"And Abraham was like, yo, I'm gonna make a solemn promise, no cap."
Genesis,21,25,Abraham called out Abimelech for snatching a precious water source that his crew forcefully confiscated.
Genesis,21,26,"Abimelech was like, 'I have no idea who did this. You never told me, and I didn't even hear about it until today.'"
Genesis,21,27,"So Abraham, like, rounded up some sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and then they both, like, made a pact and stuff."
Genesis,21,28,And Abraham put these seven cute baby sheep in a separate group from the rest of the flock.
Genesis,21,29,"Abimelech was like, 'Yo, Abraham, what's up with those seven lambs over there? What's the deal with them?"
Genesis,21,30,"So he was like, yo, take these seven cute little lamb babes from me as proof that I'm the one who dug this well."
Genesis,21,31,"So he named that place Beersheba, because that's where they made a serious promise to each other. (Beersheba means 'The well of the oath')"
Genesis,21,32,"So they formed a pact at Beersheba: then Abimelech and Phichol, the top boss of his army, went back to the land of the Philistines."
Genesis,21,33,"So, Abraham decided to plant a grove in Beersheba, and he named it after the LORD, the everlasting God. (By grove, I mean a tree, just so you know.)"
Genesis,21,34,"And Abraham, like, stayed in the land of the Philistines for a pretty long time, you know?""}"
Genesis,22,1,"So, after all that happened, God decided to test Abraham. He called out to him and said, Abrahamm!' And Abraham replied, 'Yo, what's up? I'm here.'"
Genesis,22,2,"And God said, yo, listen up. Take your son Isaac, the one you're tight with, and head to Moriah. I want you to offer him as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I'll reveal to you later on."
Genesis,22,3,"So, like, Abraham woke up super early, got his ride ready, took two of his homies, his son Isaac, and chopped up some wood for the offering. Then they all headed to the spot that God had told him about."
Genesis,22,4,"And then, on the third day, Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance."
Genesis,22,5,"Abraham told his squad, 'Yo, hold up with the ride; me and the homie are gonna head over there and do our worship thing, but we'll be back with y'all.'"" }"
Genesis,22,6,"So Abraham grabbed the wood for the burnt offering and put it on Isaac, his son. He also took the fire and a knife in his hand, and they both headed out together."
Genesis,22,7,"Isaac talked to his dad Abraham and said, 'Hey, dad!' And Abraham replied, 'Yes, my son?' Isaac then asked, 'I see the fire and the wood, but where's the lamb for the burnt offering?'}"
Genesis,22,8,"Abraham was like, 'Hey, son! God's got this covered, He's gonna hook us up with a lamb for our sacrifice.' And just like that, they headed out together on their mission."
Genesis,22,9,"So they arrived at the spot that God had directed them to. Abraham set up a sacred space, built an altar, neatly arranged the wood, and carefully tied up his son Isaac. He then placed Isaac on the altar, on top of the wood."
Genesis,22,10,"So, Abraham reached out his hand and grabbed the knife, ready to end his son's life."
Genesis,22,11,"Then this angel from the LORD hit up Abraham and was like, 'Yo, Abraham, Abraham!' And Abraham was like, 'Yeah, what's good? Here I am!'"
Genesis,22,12,"And God was like, 'Yo, don't touch the kid, like, seriously, don't do anything to him. It's all good, fam, I can see that you're all about respecting me because you didn't hold back from giving up your one and only son.'"
Genesis,22,13,"So, Abraham looked up and saw a ram with its horns caught in a thicket behind him. He went over, took the ram, and offered it as a burnt offering instead of his son."
Genesis,22,14,"And Abraham named that place Jehovahjireh, which basically means 'The Lord will see or provide', as people still say nowadays, He'll show up when we need Him, on His mountain."
Genesis,22,15,"Then the angel of the LORD hit up Abraham again, straight from the heavens."
Genesis,22,16,"And God said, I swear on my own name, for you have done this incredible thing without holding back your son, your one and only."
Genesis,22,17,"I'm gonna hook you up with some major blessings, like, for real. Your descendants are gonna blow up big time, like the stars in the sky or the sand on the beach, you know what I'm sayin'? Oh, and they're gonna totally crush their enemies and take over everything, no doubt."
Genesis,22,18,"And through your descendants, all the nations on earth will receive blessings, because you listened and followed what I said."
Genesis,22,19,"So Abraham went back to his squad, and they got up and rolled together to Beersheba; and Abraham settled down in Beersheba."
Genesis,22,20,"After all those events went down, Abraham got word that Milcah, you know, she ended up having some kids for his bro Nahor."
Genesis,22,21,"Huz, the eldest bro, and Buz, his fam, and Kemuel, Aram's founder,"
Genesis,22,22,"And Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel were all part of the crew."
Genesis,22,23,"And Bethuel had a daughter named Rebekah, who Nahor (Abraham's bro) had eight kids with Milcah. (Rebekah is also called Rebecca in Greek.)"
Genesis,22,24,"And this dude had a side chick named Reumah, and she gave birth to Tebah, Gaham, Thahash, and Maachah.""}"
Genesis,23,1,Sarah was 127 years old when she passed away. That's how long she lived.
Genesis,23,2,"So, like, Sarah passed away in this place called Kirjatharba, which is the same as Hebron in Canaan. And Abraham, like, went there to grieve and cry for Sarah, ya know?"
Genesis,23,3,"So, like, Abraham got up from where his peeps were chillin' with the deceased, and he started talkin' to the sons of Heth, like, yo,"
Genesis,23,4,"Yo, I'm like a total outsider chilling with you here. Can you hook me up with a spot to bury my dead homie, so I don't have to see them anymore?"
Genesis,23,5,"Yo, Abraham, the kids of Heth responded to him like,"
Genesis,23,6,"Listen up, dude: you're, like, a powerful leader in our crew. You can totally pick any of our graves to bury your dead peeps. We've got your back and we won't stop you from using any of 'em. Just do what you gotta do. (By the way, 'a prince of God' is another way to say you're a total boss!)"
Genesis,23,7,"So Abraham got up and respectfully greeted the people of the land, even the children of Heth."
Genesis,23,8,"So, like, this guy was talking with his peeps, saying, 'If you're cool with it, I wanna bury my dead away from my view. Can you lend a hand and ask Ephron, Zohar's son, for me?'"
Genesis,23,9,I'm hoping Abraham will let me have the cave of Machpelah at the edge of his field. I'll pay him whatever it's worth so I can use it as a burial place here. You guys cool with that?
Genesis,23,10,"So, Ephron was living among the children of Heth and he spoke up in front of everyone at the gate of his city, answering Abraham. It was like a public spectacle, you know?"
Genesis,23,11,"Actually, listen up, sir! I want to give you the whole field and the cave that's in it. I'm giving it to you right in front of everyone. You can bury your dead there."
Genesis,23,12,And Abraham showed respect to the people of the land by humbling himself.
Genesis,23,13,"So, he talked to Ephron in front of everyone, like, 'Hey, man, if you're down for it, listen up. I really need to buy that field from you, you know? I'll pay you a fair price for it, no worries. Just take the money from me, and I can finally give my deceased a proper burial there.'"
Genesis,23,14,"Ephron was like, 'Yo Abraham, listen up,'"
Genesis,23,15,"Yo, listen up, my dude: the land is valued at a cool four hundred shekels of silver. But honestly, what's that small amount gonna matter between you and me? So, let's just bury your dead fam and move on."
Genesis,23,16,"So Abraham listened to Ephron and paid him the silver he had promised, which he mentioned in front of the sons of Heth, a total of four hundred shekels of silver, the currency used by the merchants."
Genesis,23,17,"And the land that belonged to Ephron, which was in Machpelah, in front of Mamre, along with the field, the cave, and all the trees that were in the area, were legally confirmed."
Genesis,23,18,"Abraham was given this prime spot as his own in front of everyone who came through the city gate, while the children of Heth were there."
Genesis,23,19,"And then, Abraham laid Sarah, his wife, to rest in the cave of the field of Machpelah, right by Mamre. That place is known as Hebron in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,23,20,"So basically, the field and the cave in it, they were like totally secured for Abraham to use as a burial place by the sons of Heth.""}"
Genesis,24,1,"Abraham was, like, really old and had lived a long, fulfilling life. The Lord had hooked him up with blessings galore, like seriously, everything was going great for him."
Genesis,24,2,"So Abraham was like, 'Hey, servant dude in charge of everything I own, come here and do me a solid. Put your hand under my thigh, please.'"
Genesis,24,3,"Yo, I'm gonna need you to swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and earth, that you won't let my son marry any of the Canaanite girls here where we live. Like, it's important to me, bro."
Genesis,24,4,But you should go to my homeland and my relatives and find a wife for my son Isaac.
Genesis,24,5,"The servant was like, maybe the woman won't wanna come with me to this place. Should I bring your son back to where you're from?"
Genesis,24,6,"And Abraham was like, yo, make sure you never take my son there again, alright?"
Genesis,24,7,"The big man upstairs, who totally rescued me from my fam's crib and homeland, and straight up talked to me, and made a promise like 'Yo, I'll totally give this land to your peeps'; he's gonna send an angel to help you out, so you can find a wifey for my son over there."
Genesis,24,8,"And if the woman doesn't want to go with you, then you won't be bound by the promise I made. Just promise me you won't take my son there again."
Genesis,24,9,"And the servant placed his hand beneath Abraham's thigh, and made a solemn promise to him regarding that matter."
Genesis,24,10,"So the servant grabbed ten of his master's camels and set off. He had all of his master's stuff with him, and he headed to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor."
Genesis,24,11,"And he had his camels chillin' outside the city by a water well when it was getting late in the evening, you know, around the time when girls usually go out to fetch water."
Genesis,24,12,"Then he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I'm totally praying that you make things go smoothly for me today, and be super nice to my master Abraham."
Genesis,24,13,"Yo, check it out, I'm just chillin' at the water well, and these girls from the city roll up to get some water."
Genesis,24,14,"So, like, here's the plan: If I walk up to this girl and ask her for a drink from her pitcher, and then she's all like, 'Sure, and I'll give water to your camels too,' then we'll know that she's the one you chose for Isaac and that you've been showing kindness to my master."
Genesis,24,15,"So, like, while he was still talking, Rebekah suddenly shows up, and she's, like, Bethuel's daughter and Milcah's granddaughter. Oh, and BTW, Milcah is Nahor's wife, who is actually Abraham's bro. And she's got this pitcher chillin' on her shoulder, ready to go."
Genesis,24,16,"And the girl was really attractive, like, her looks were on point, and she was a total virgin, like, no one had ever been with her, you know? So she went down to the well, filled her pitcher, and came back up. She was rocking that good vibe, you feel me?"
Genesis,24,17,"So the servant like, quickly went up to her and was like, 'Hey, could you totally hook me up with a sip of water from your pitcher?'"
Genesis,24,18,"And she was like, 'Yo, have a sip, dude.' So she quickly took her water jug and lowered it down, then handed him a drink."
Genesis,24,19,"After she finished giving him a drink, she was like, 'Yo, I'll hook up your camels too, and keep filling up their tanks until they're fully hydrated.'"" }"
Genesis,24,20,"She quickly poured the water from her pitcher into the trough, then hurried back to the well for more, drawing water for all of his camels."
Genesis,24,21,"The guy was like shook and didn't say anything, trying to figure out if God made his trip go well or not."
Genesis,24,22,"And so, after the camels were done quenching their thirst, the man grabbed a super cool golden earring that weighed half a shekel, and two awesome bracelets weighing ten shekels each for her hands. (By the way, the alternative translation for 'earring' is 'jewel for the forehead'.)"
Genesis,24,23,"And the dude was like, 'Yo, whose daughter are you? Can you let us know? We need a place to crash in your pops' crib.'"" }"
Genesis,24,24,"And she was like, yo, I'm the daughter of Bethuel, who is Milcah's son. My mom gave birth to me and Nahor is my dad."
Genesis,24,25,"She told him, 'We've got plenty of straw and food for the animals, and a cozy place to crash."
Genesis,24,26,The guy lowered his head and showed respect to the LORD.
Genesis,24,27,"And he was like, OMG, how unbelievably blessed is the LORD God of my master Abraham! Like, seriously, my master has never been abandoned by God's mercy and faithfulness. And, BTW, while I was on my way, the LORD totally guided me to the house of my master's relatives."
Genesis,24,28,"So, like, the girl sprinted off and spilled the tea to her fam 'bout what went down."
Genesis,24,29,"Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and Laban straight up bolted towards the dude at the well."
Genesis,24,30,"So, like, when he noticed the cool earrings and bracelets on his sister's hands, and heard his sister Rebekah telling him all about what the man said to her, he went straight up to the man. And guess what? He found the dude chilling by the camels at the well."
Genesis,24,31,"He was like, 'Yo, come on in, you cool person blessed by the LORD. Why you waiting outside? I got the crib ready and even a spot for your camels.'"" }"
Genesis,24,32,"So the guy went inside and took the belts off his camels, and then he provided them with straw and food. He also gave them water to clean their own feet and the feet of the men who were with him."
Genesis,24,33,"So, this food was brought to him to eat, but he was like, nah, I'm not gonna eat until I've finished my important task. And he was all like, go ahead and spill the tea."
Genesis,24,34,"And he was like, 'Yo, I'm Abraham's servant, you know.'"" }"
Genesis,24,35,"And God has blessed my master so much, and he has become really successful. He has been given tons of animals like sheep and cows, as well as a lot of money, including silver and gold. He even has a bunch of people working for him, both guys and girls, and he has plenty of camels and donkeys too."
Genesis,24,36,"And Sarah, my master's wife, gave birth to a son for my master even though she was old. And my master has given him everything he owns."
Genesis,24,37,"So, my boss was like, 'Swear to me that you won't let my son marry any Canaanite girls, since I live among them.'"" }"
Genesis,24,38,"But you gotta head to my dad's crib and link up with my fam, and find a wifey for my son, ya feel me?"
Genesis,24,39,"So I told my boss, like, maybe this girl won't come with me, you know?"
Genesis,24,40,"And he was like, yo, the LORD, the one I'm tight with, will totally send his angel to roll with you and make your journey successful. And when you find bae, make sure she's from my fam, like my extended fam and my dad's crib, ya feel?"
Genesis,24,41,"So, like, once you reach my fam, you're totally off the hook from this promise I made. And, like, if they don't hook you up with what you need, then you're not responsible for my promise anymore."
Genesis,24,42,"So, like, I went to the well today, and I was all like, 'Yo, God of my master Abraham, if you could hook me up and make my journey successful, that would be totally awesome, you know?"
Genesis,24,43,"Yo, check it out, I'm chilling near this dope water well. So here's the deal: when this cool virgin comes to get some water, I'm gonna ask her politely, 'Could you hook me up with a sip from your pitcher, please?'"
Genesis,24,44,"And she says to me, 'Yo, drink up too, and I'll hook up your camels with some water. If that happens, then she's the one that the LORD has picked for my master's son.'"" }"
Genesis,24,45,"And like, before I even finished like, talking to myself, bro, Rebekah straight up came out with her water pitcher on her shoulder, and went down to the well, ya know? She totally drew some water, and I was like, 'Yo, can I like, sip that?'"
Genesis,24,46,"And then, like, she quickly took her pitcher off her shoulder and was all like, 'Here, bro, drink some water!' And she even offered to give water to all your camels too! So I had a drink, and she made sure the camels got hydrated as well, no cap."
Genesis,24,47,"So, like, I was all like, 'Yo, whose girl are you?' And she was like, 'I'm Bethuel's daughter, you know, Nahor's son's girl, that Milcah gave birth to.' And then I hooked her up with this sick earring for her face and some dope bracelets for her hands."
Genesis,24,48,"So, I humbly showed my respect by bowing my head and giving praise to the LORD. I blessed the LORD God of Abraham, the one who guided me in finding a suitable wife for my master's son from among our relatives."
Genesis,24,49,"Hey, listen up! If you're down to be real and show some love and respect to my boss, let me know. But if you're not about that, just be straight with me. I gotta know which way to go, whether to keep rolling with you or find another path."
Genesis,24,50,"Laban and Bethuel were like, 'Dude, this is all coming from the Lord. We can't say anything negative or positive to you.'"" }"
Genesis,24,51,"Yo, check it out, Rebekah's right here, so grab her and bounce. Make her your boss's son's wifey, just like the LORD said."
Genesis,24,52,"And, like, when Abraham's servant heard what they said, he like totally worshipped the LORD by like bowing down to the earth, you know?"
Genesis,24,53,"So, the servant pulled out some sick silver bling, some lit gold bling, and some fresh clothes, and he hooked Rebekah up with all of it. And he didn't forget about her brother and mother either – he gave them some dope gifts too. (BTW, in Hebrew, they call the bling 'vessels')."" }"
Genesis,24,54,"And they were grubbin' and sippin', him and his homies, and chillaxed all night; then when they woke up in the morning, he said, 'Yo, let me bounce back to my master, y'know.'"" }"
Genesis,24,55,"So her bro and her mom were like, yo, let the girl chill with us for a hot min, like at least ten days. But after that, she can bounce. Oh, and by the way, 'a few days' could also mean, like, a whole year or ten months, just FYI."
Genesis,24,56,"And he was like, listen up fam, don't be stopping me, 'cause the LORD has totally blessed my journey. Let me bounce and head back to my master, okay?"
Genesis,24,57,"And they were like, let's go ask the girl herself and see what she says."
Genesis,24,58,"So they hit up Rebekah and asked her, 'You down to roll with this dude?' And she replied, 'Yeah, I'm down.'""} Note: Please remember to respect religious texts and the beliefs of others while translating."
Genesis,24,59,"So they said, 'Okay, Rebekah, go on your way with your nurse, Abraham's servant, and his crew."
Genesis,24,60,"And they were like, 'Rebekah, you're one of us, sis! May you be a powerful leader, raising generations upon generations, and may your descendants overcome any opposition.'"
Genesis,24,61,"And Rebekah was like, 'Let's go, girls!' So they hopped on those camels and started trailing behind the guy. And the servant was like, 'Rebekah, come with me!' and they both hit the road."
Genesis,24,62,So Isaac pulled up to the well Lahairoi because that's where he was living down in the southern part of town.
Genesis,24,63,"So Isaac decided to take a chill moment out in the field during sunset. As he looked up, he spotted a group of camels heading his way."
Genesis,24,64,"{ ""translation"": ""Rebekah looked up and spotted Isaac, so she hopped off the camel."" }"
Genesis,24,65,"So she asked the servant, 'Who's that dude walking towards us in the field?' And the servant replied, 'That's my boss.' So she grabbed a veil and covered herself."
Genesis,24,66,And the servant spilled all the tea to Isaac about everything he did.
Genesis,24,67,"So Isaac brought Rebekah into his mom Sarah's tent, and they got married. He really loved her, and it helped him feel better after his mom passed away.""}"
Genesis,25,1,Abraham decided to start a new chapter in his love life and got together with a woman named Keturah.
Genesis,25,2,"And she gave birth to Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah."
Genesis,25,3,"Jokshan became the proud dad of Sheba and Dedan. Dedan had some cool offspring too - Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim."
Genesis,25,4,"And here are the names of the kids of Midian: Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. Yup, they're all the children of Keturah."
Genesis,25,5,And Abraham passed down everything he owned to Isaac.
Genesis,25,6,"But Abraham also gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac while he was still alive, towards the eastern part of the country."
Genesis,25,7,"And these are the days that Abraham was on this planet, living a solid 175 years."
Genesis,25,8,"And then Abraham passed away, peacefully departing in his golden years as a wise elder, having lived a fulfilling life, and was reunited with his loved ones."
Genesis,25,9,"So Isaac and Ishmael, Abraham's sons, laid him to rest in the cave of Machpelah, which was in a field owned by Ephron the Hittite and located near Mamre."
Genesis,25,10,"Abraham bought a field from the sons of Heth, and that's where both he and his wife Sarah were laid to rest."
Genesis,25,11,"After Abraham died, God blessed his son Isaac, and Isaac lived by the well Lahairoi."
Genesis,25,12,"Here's the scoop on Ishmael, Abraham's son. Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's helper, gave birth to him."
Genesis,25,13,"So, like, here's a list of the names of Ishmael's sons, you know? They were named according to their generations and stuff. The eldest one was Nebajoth, cool name, right? Then there's Kedar, Adbeel, and Mibsam. That's the whole crew!"
Genesis,25,14,"And like, there were also Mishma, Dumah, and Massa, you know?"
Genesis,25,15,"Hadar, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: (Hadar, also known as Hadad)"
Genesis,25,16,"These are the homies of Ishmael and these are their names, based on where they chill and the spots they run; twelve bosses repping their different nations."
Genesis,25,17,And this is how long Ishmael lived: 137 years. Then he died and reunited with his ancestors.
Genesis,25,18,"So they lived from Havilah to Shur, which is in front of Egypt as you head towards Assyria. And he passed away while his siblings were there."
Genesis,25,19,"So, like, this is the fam tree of Isaac, Abraham's kid: Abraham was the dad who had Isaac, you know?"
Genesis,25,20,"Isaac was, like, 40 years old when he decided to marry Rebekah, who was the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian from Padanaram. Oh, and she was also Laban the Syrian's sister."
Genesis,25,21,"So Isaac had a convo with the LORD about his wife, cuz she couldn't have kids. And the LORD listened to him and made it happen, and his wife Rebekah got pregnant."
Genesis,25,22,"So, like, the babies were, like, fighting inside her and she was all like, why is this happening to me? And then she decided to go ask the LORD about it."
Genesis,25,23,"And God was like, 'Yo, listen up, sis. You got two nations chillin' in your belly, and they're gonna be two totally different groups of peeps. One of 'em is gonna be more powerful than the other, and the older one's gonna end up serving the younger one.'"
Genesis,25,24,"And when the time was up for her to give birth, surprise! She had not just one, but two babies growing inside her."
Genesis,25,25,"The first baby came out all red and covered in hair, so they named him Esau."
Genesis,25,26,"Then his brother came out, grabbing onto Esau's heel; his name was Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when Rebecca gave birth to them."
Genesis,25,27,"And the dudes were all grown up: Esau was like, this super skilled hunter, always out in nature and stuff; and Jacob, on the other hand, was more of a chill dude who preferred the laid-back tent life."
Genesis,25,28,"Isaac was totally vibing with Esau because the dude knew how to cook some legit venison. But Rebekah, on the other hand, was all about Jacob. (BTW, Esau had just taken a big bite of that juicy deer meat when this whole situation went down.)"
Genesis,25,29,"So Jacob cooked some really awesome food, and Esau came back from the field, super exhausted and hungry:"
Genesis,25,30,"And Esau was like, 'Yo Jacob, hook me up with that fire red stew please! I'm hella starving, no cap.' That's why his name became Edom, which literally means 'Red'."
Genesis,25,31,"Yo, bro! Jacob's like, 'Sell me your birthright today.'"
Genesis,25,32,"Esau was like, yo, I'm so done. Like, dying over here. What's even the point of this birthright, man? Like, what good is it gonna do me?"
Genesis,25,33,"And Jacob was like, 'Yo, promise me right now.' So the other guy was like, 'Yeah, bro, I promise.' And he ended up selling his birthright to Jacob."
Genesis,25,34,"So, like, Jacob gave Esau some bread and lentil stew. And Esau was, like, hungry so he ate and drank, then he got up and left. And that's how Esau totally disrespected his birthright, man.""}"
Genesis,26,1,"So, like, there was a legit famine happening, you know? And it wasn't just any famine, it was the second one after the whole Abraham era. And guess what? Isaac, being the smart dude he is, decided to roll up to Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, in Gerar. Can't blame the guy for trying to find some food, right?"
Genesis,26,2,"And then God showed up to him and said, 'Yo, don't even think about going to Egypt. Just chill in the land that I'm gonna hook you up with.'"" }"
Genesis,26,3,"Hang out in this land, and I'll be right there with you, bringing all the good vibes and blessings your way. I promise that you and your future fam will own all these dope countries, just like I swore to your dad Abraham."
Genesis,26,4,"And I'll totally hook you up with a crazy amount of descendants, like a ton of stars up in the sky! Plus, I'll hand over all these countries to your descendants, and through them, every nation on Earth will score some serious blessings. You're gonna love it, trust me!"
Genesis,26,5,"Because Abraham totally prioritized listening to me and respected my instructions, rules, and guidelines."
Genesis,26,6,So Isaac went and lived in Gerar:
Genesis,26,7,"So, the people of that area asked him about his wife, and he replied, 'She's my sis.' He was afraid to admit that she was his wife because he thought the people might kill him to have her, since she was really good-looking."
Genesis,26,8,"So, like, after Isaac had been living there for a while, Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, was checking out the scene from his window. And guess what? He spotted Isaac and Rebekah, Isaac's wife, having a chill time together."
Genesis,26,9,"So Abimelech hits up Isaac and he's like, 'Dude, you need to explain. It's pretty clear that she's your wife, so why'd you say she's your sister?' Isaac tells him straight up, 'I said that because I was scared I might get killed over her.'"" }"
Genesis,26,10,"Abimelech was like, dude, what did you just do to us? It could've been really bad if some random person hooked up with your wife, and then we'd all be in trouble."
Genesis,26,11,"Abimelech told his squad, 'Look, if anyone even thinks about messing with this dude or his wife, they're straight up gonna face serious consequences - like, death, for real.'"" }"
Genesis,26,12,"So Isaac planted crops in that place, and in the same year he got a crazy good harvest, like a hundred times more than what he planted. And God totally blessed him, man. Like, it was unreal. #blessed #grateful #agriculturegoals"
Genesis,26,13,"And the dude totally thrived, and kept moving forward, and grew until he became seriously awesome: {went...: That's like, he kept going and going}"
Genesis,26,14,"Yo, this dude had mad flocks and herds, and a bunch of servants, like, on deck. And the Philistines were totally jealous of him, bro. (BTW, servants can also mean like, workers or peeps helping out in the fields, just so you know.)"
Genesis,26,15,"Back in the day, when Abraham's crew was making wells, the Philistines decided to be real petty and shut them down and fill 'em up with dirt."
Genesis,26,16,"Abimelech was like, 'Yo Isaac, you gotta bounce! You're way too powerful for us to handle.'"" }"
Genesis,26,17,"So Isaac bounced from there and set up his tent in the chill spot called the valley of Gerar, and lived there."
Genesis,26,18,"So Isaac decided to reopen the water wells that his father Abraham had dug, because those pesky Philistines had plugged them up when Abraham passed away. And you know what? Isaac decided to give them the same names that his dad had given them before."
Genesis,26,19,"So Isaac's servants started digging in the valley and they discovered a well with fresh, flowing water."
Genesis,26,20,"So like, the peeps who took care of the cows in Gerar got all up in Isaac's peeps' faces, saying, 'Yo, the water's ours!' This made Isaac name the well 'Esek,' meaning, like, a big argument and all that."
Genesis,26,21,"So they dug another well, but there was a lot of conflict surrounding it, so they named it Sitnah, which means Hatred."
Genesis,26,22,"So, like, this guy moved to another place and dug a new well without any drama. He named it Rehoboth, which means 'Room', and said that the big man upstairs, the LORD, made space for us and we'll thrive in this land. Cool, right?"
Genesis,26,23,And then he went up from there to Beersheba.
Genesis,26,24,"That night, God showed up and said to him, 'Yo, I'm the one who was with your pops Abraham. Don't trip, I got your back. I'll bring you blessings and make your squad multiply, all because of Abraham, my homie.'"
Genesis,26,25,"So, he built an altar and gave a shout-out to the LORD, and set up his tent there. Isaac's crew went ahead and excavated a well in that spot."
Genesis,26,26,"So Abimelech slid into his DMs from Gerar, with Ahuzzath, one of his homies, and Phichol, the head cap of his squad."
Genesis,26,27,"Isaac was like, yo, what's the deal with you guys coming to me when you clearly have beef with me and straight up kicked me out?"
Genesis,26,28,"And they were like, dude, we totally noticed that God was hanging with you. So we were like, let's make this official and have an oath between us, you know, like a legit agreement. We wanna make a covenant with you, man. Like, it's real!"
Genesis,26,29,"We didn't mean any harm, fam. We never laid a finger on you and we've only shown you love and respect. We let you go peacefully, and now you're totally blessed by the LORD, yo. Just saying, if you realize it."
Genesis,26,30,"And he threw them a lit party, and they totally grubbed on some epic food and drank up!"
Genesis,26,31,They woke up early in the morning and made a serious promise to each other. Then Isaac said goodbye to them and they left without any problems.
Genesis,26,32,"So, like, on that very day, Isaac's homies rolled up and gave him the scoop about the well they had dug. And they were like, 'Yo, dude, we found water!'"
Genesis,26,33,"And he named it Shebah: so that's why the city is called Beersheba even today. Shebah means 'an oath', and Beersheba means 'the well of the oath'."
Genesis,26,34,"Esau was, like, 40 years old when he married Judith, who was the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and also Bashemath, who was the daughter of Elon the Hittite. No biggie."
Genesis,26,35,"And that really upset Isaac and Rebekah, it was like a major downer for them. They were totally bummed out.""}"
Genesis,27,1,"So, check it: Isaac was getting up there in age, and his eyesight wasn't so great anymore, you know? He called his oldest son, Esau, and was like, 'Yo, my son!' And Esau was like, 'Yeah, dad, what's up?'"
Genesis,27,2,"And he was like, yo guys, listen up, I'm getting old and I really have no clue when I'm gonna kick the bucket, you feel me?"
Genesis,27,3,"Hey, could you grab your gear - like your cool weapons, quiver, and bow - and head out to the wild? I'm really craving some fresh venison, so why not snag us some? Oh, and by the way, 'take' in Hebrew means 'hunt,' so go on a hunting spree for me!"
Genesis,27,4,"Hey, whip up some of that delicious food that I really enjoy and bring it over to me, so I can dig in and give you my heartfelt blessing before I kick the bucket."
Genesis,27,5,"And Rebekah totally overheard when Isaac was talking to his son Esau. So Esau was like, 'Yo, I'm heading out to the field to hunt some game and bring it back.'"
Genesis,27,6,"So, like, Rebekah comes up to Jacob, her son, and she's all like, 'Yo, listen up! I totally overheard our dad talking to Esau, your bro, and this is what he said:"
Genesis,27,7,"Yo, go grab me some venison and whip up somethin' tasty so I can devour it and give you my blessings in front of the LORD before I kick the bucket."
Genesis,27,8,"So listen up, my homie, do what I say and follow my instructions, aight?"
Genesis,27,9,"Hey, head over to the flock and grab two awesome baby goats for me. I'm gonna whip up some tasty grub for your dad, just the way he likes it."
Genesis,27,10,"And you're gonna take that thing to your dad, so he can grub and give you a dope blessing before he kicks the bucket."
Genesis,27,11,"So, like, Jacob was talking to his mom, Rebekah, and he's all like, 'Yo, check it out, Esau, my bro, he's, uh, super hairy and I'm, like, totally smooth.'"" }"
Genesis,27,12,"My dad might catch onto me, and he'll see me as a liar; then I'll totally jinx myself and end up with bad luck, not good luck."
Genesis,27,13,"Then his mom was like, 'Hey, if you wanna curse someone, curse me instead, my dude. But just do me a solid and listen to what I say, go grab what I need.'"" }"
Genesis,27,14,"So he went and got what she needed and brought it to his mom. His mom cooked up a delicious meal, just the way his dad liked it."
Genesis,27,15,"And Rebekah took the flyest clothes of her older son Esau, which were chillin' in the crib, and swagged them out on Jacob, her younger son. (Desirable)"
Genesis,27,16,Then she placed the goat's fur on his hands and the sleek part of his neck.
Genesis,27,17,And she handed over the delicious food and the bread that she had made to her son Jacob.
Genesis,27,18,"So he went up to his dad and said, 'Sup, Dad?' And his dad was like, 'Hey, what's up? Who are you, my child?'}"
Genesis,27,19,"Then Jacob was like, 'Yo, Dad. It's me, Esau, your firstborn. I totally did what you asked me to do. So, check it - why don't you get up and come chill with me while I serve you some bomb venison? That way, you can bless my soul, ya know?'"
Genesis,27,20,"Isaac asked his son, 'Yo, how did you manage to find it so fast, bro?' And his son replied, 'Dude, it's all thanks to the LORD your God. He brought it right to me, man.'"
Genesis,27,21,"Yo, Jacob, come here, bro, so I can check if you're really my son Esau or not by touchin' ya."
Genesis,27,22,"So Jacob came close to his father Isaac, and he touched him. Then Isaac said, 'The voice sounds like Jacob's voice, but the hands feel like Esau's hands.'"
Genesis,27,23,"And he couldn't tell it was him because his hands were all hairy like his brother Esau's hands, so he gave him his blessing."
Genesis,27,24,"And he was like, 'Yo, are you my boy Esau?' And he was like, 'Yeah, that's me!'"
Genesis,27,25,"He was like, 'Yo, bring that food over here so I can chow down on my son's delicious meat and then give you a major blessing.' So, the food was brought to him and he totally ate it. And then, he got some wine and had a sip."
Genesis,27,26,"So, like, Isaac's dad, he's all like, 'Yo, come over here and give me a kiss, bro.'"" }"
Genesis,27,27,"Then he walked up to him and gave him a hug: and he noticed the pleasant scent of his clothes, and gave him his blessings, saying, 'Look, my child smells as refreshing as a field that the LORD has blessed.'"
Genesis,27,28,"Yo, may God bless you with the chilled vibes of heaven's dew, and the epic richness of the earth, hooking you up with mad grain and fine wine."
Genesis,27,29,"Yo, have peeps serve you and nations show you respect. Rule over your bros and let your mom's sons show you respect too. Anyone who disses you is cursed, but those who show you love are blessed."
Genesis,27,30,"So basically, right after Isaac finished giving his blessing to Jacob and Jacob was just about to leave his father Isaac's side, Esau, his brother, showed up from his hunting trip."
Genesis,27,31,"He cooked up some delicious food and brought it to his father, saying, 'Dad, get up and enjoy this tasty dish I made! Then you can give me your blessing.'"" }"
Genesis,27,32,"Isaac's dad was like, 'Yo, who are you?' And he answered, 'I'm your son, Esau, your OG firstborn.'"" }"
Genesis,27,33,"Isaac was super shook and was like, 'Yo, who was it that hunted and brought me that meat, and I ate it all before you came, and I blessed him? Yeah, he's gonna be blessed for real.'"
Genesis,27,34,"Esau totally lost it when he heard his dad's words. He just broke down and cried like never before. He desperately pleaded with his dad, saying, 'Dad, please bless me too, just like you blessed my brother.'"" }"
Genesis,27,35,"And he was like, yo, your brother totally pulled a sneaky move and snatched your blessing, yo."
Genesis,27,36,"And he was like, yo, isn't his name Jacob for real? 'Cause he totally snaked me two times: first, he straight up stole my birthright, and now he's gone and swiped my blessing too. And I was like, bruh, you still got a blessing left for me or what? (By the way, Jacob means 'A supplanter', just so you know)"
Genesis,27,37,"Yo, Esau, listen up. I gotta tell you something. I made Jacob your boss, yeah, for real. All his homies are his servants now. And I've been hooking him up with food and drinks. But now, dude, what should I do for you, my son?"
Genesis,27,38,"And Esau was like, woah dad, you only have one blessing to give? Can you bless me too, my father? And Esau couldn't hold it in, he was all emotional and started crying."
Genesis,27,39,"Then Isaac, his dad, replied and said to him, listen up! Your place to chill will be the complete bomb, full of all the good stuff from the earth and the fresh droplets of heaven above."
Genesis,27,40,"You'll be all about the sword, livin' your life and doin' your thing, but you'll also be servin' your bro. But hey, there's gonna come a time when you'll have the upper hand and you'll be free from his control."
Genesis,27,41,"Esau totally despised Jacob 'cause their dad went and blessed him. Esau was thinkin' to himself, 'Once our old man kicks the bucket, I'm gonna knock Jacob off the face of the earth.'"" }"
Genesis,27,42,"Rebekah heard what Esau, her older son, said and got in touch with Jacob, her younger son. She told him, 'Listen up, Esau is actually finding solace in the idea of taking you out.'"" }"
Genesis,27,43,"So, like dude, listen up! Go and do what I'm telling you to do, okay? Get up and run over to Laban, my bro, who lives in Haran."
Genesis,27,44,"Just hang out with him for a bit, until your brother calms down and is no longer mad at you;"
Genesis,27,45,"When your bro is no longer mad at you and forgets what you did to him, I'll hit you up and bring you back. I don't wanna miss out on both of you on the same day, ya know?"
Genesis,27,46,"Rebekah told Isaac that she's seriously tired of dealing with the Hethite girls. She's worried that if Jacob ends up marrying one of them, it won't bring any happiness or fulfillment to her life. Like, she's just over it, you know?""}"
Genesis,28,1,"So Isaac called Jacob over and gave him a blessing, and he told him in no uncertain terms, 'Dude, you better not marry any Canaanite girl, okay? Like, seriously, find someone from a different tribe.'"" }"
Genesis,28,2,"Yo, get up and head to Padanaram, to the crib of Bethuel, your mom's pops. Find yourself a wife from there, one of Laban's daughters, your mom's bro."
Genesis,28,3,"And God, like, totally bless you with all the good vibes, and make you super successful, and help you grow, so that you can, like, gather a bunch of awesome people together."
Genesis,28,4,"And God's gonna hook you up with the same blessings He gave to Abraham, for you and your descendants. You're gonna inherit the land where you're just a visitor right now, the one God gave to Abraham. #nomorestrangerdanger"
Genesis,28,5,"So Isaac told Jacob to leave and go to a place called Padanaram to find his uncle Laban, who was Rebekah's brother and the son of Bethuel the Syrian. Both Jacob and Esau had Rebekah as their mother."
Genesis,28,6,"When Esau peeped that Isaac had given Jacob the blessings and sent him off to find a wife from Padanaram, and on top of that, Isaac specifically told him not to marry any Canaanite girls;"
Genesis,28,7,"And Jacob, like, totally listened to his dad and mom and decided to head over to Padanaram. It was all about that family love and respect, you know?"
Genesis,28,8,Esau noticed that his father Isaac didn't approve of the girls from Canaan; they weren't his vibe.
Genesis,28,9,"So, Esau went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, who was Ishmael's daughter and Abraham's grandson. Mahalath was also Nebajoth's sister. (Mahalath may also be called Bashemath.)"
Genesis,28,10,"So, like, Jacob left Beersheba and headed towards Haran. (Haran is like the ancient Greek version of Charran, ya know?)"
Genesis,28,11,"So, he found himself in this spot and decided to spend the night there because the sun had gone down. And since he didn't have any fancy pillows, he used some stones he found there and laid down to get some sleep."
Genesis,28,12,"So, like, he had this dream and saw a ladder, right? And this ladder was on the ground, but it stretched all the way up to heaven. And get this! There were angels of God going up and down on the ladder. Pretty surreal, huh?"
Genesis,28,13,"And guess what, the LORD was standing right above it and said, 'Yo, I'm the LORD God of Abraham, your pops, and the God of Isaac. The land you're chillin' on right now? Imma give it to you and your fam.'"" }"
Genesis,28,14,"And I promise that your descendants will be like grains of sand on the earth, spreading out in every direction - to the west, east, north, and south. Through you and your descendants, all the families on earth will receive blessings."
Genesis,28,15,"Yo, listen up! I'm gonna be right by your side, no matter where you go. I'll have your back and make sure you're good. And I promise, I won't bounce until I follow through on everything I've promised you. We're in this together, fam!"
Genesis,28,16,"And then Jacob woke up from his nap and was like, 'Woah, God is totally here! And I didn't even realize it!'"
Genesis,28,17,"And he was shook, and was like, This place is insane! This is totally God's hangout spot, the ultimate front door to heaven."
Genesis,28,18,"So Jacob woke up super early in the morning, grabbed the stone he had used as a pillow, and turned it into a cool-looking pillar. He then poured some oil on top of it."
Genesis,28,19,"And he named that place Bethel, but initially it was called Luz. Bethel means 'The house of God'."
Genesis,28,20,"So Jacob made this promise, he was like, 'Yo, if God stays by my side and protects me wherever I go, providing me with food and clothes,"
Genesis,28,21,"So, like, when I get home to my dad's crib all chill and drama-free, that's when I'm gonna be all about the big man upstairs, ya know?"
Genesis,28,22,"And this awesome rock that I've designated as a pillar is gonna be God's crib, you know? And no matter what cool stuff you bless me with, I'm gonna hook you up with a solid ten percent, no questions asked.""}"
Genesis,29,1,"So Jacob flexed and started his journey, and rolled up to the land of the cool peeps from the east. {flexed...: Heb. lifted up his feet} {peeps: Heb. children}"
Genesis,29,2,"So he sees, like, this well in the field and whoa, there are three groups of sheep chilling right next to it. They use that well to give water to the sheep. Oh, and there's a big stone covering the opening of the well."
Genesis,29,3,"Everyone brought their flocks together, and together they moved the big rock covering the opening of the well. They gave water to the sheep and then put the rock back in its spot."
Genesis,29,4,"Jacob asked them, 'Yo, where you guys from, fam?' And they replied, 'We're from Haran, bro.'"" }"
Genesis,29,5,"He was like, 'Do you guys know Laban, Nahor's son?' And they were all like, 'Yeah, we know him!'"" }"
Genesis,29,6,"And he's like, 'Hey, how's it going?' And they're all like, 'Yeah, he's good.' And guess what, Rachel, his daughter, is coming with the sheep."
Genesis,29,7,"And he was like, dude, it's still early in the day and not the right time to gather the cattle. So, take care of the sheep by giving them water and then go and feed them."
Genesis,29,8,"They were like, 'Sorry, we gotta wait until all the flocks are here and they move that big ol' rock from the well. Only then can we give water to the sheep, you know?'"
Genesis,29,9,"And as he was talking to them, Rachel showed up with her dad's flock of sheep because she was the one taking care of them."
Genesis,29,10,"So, like, Jacob peeped Rachel, the daughter of his mom's bro Laban, and also noticed Laban's sheep. And Jacob got all close to the well, moved the big stone that covered it, and gave water to Laban's flock."
Genesis,29,11,"And Jacob kissed Rachel, and he couldn't hold back his emotions so he let out a cry."
Genesis,29,12,"So Jacob said to Rachel, 'Yo, I'm basically your dad's bro and Rebekah's son.' And Rachel was all like, 'OMG, I gotta spill the tea to my dad ASAP!'"
Genesis,29,13,"So, like, Laban heard that his sister's son, Jacob, had arrived, and he was super stoked about it. He ran up to meet him, gave him a big hug and smooch, and invited him to his place. Then Jacob told Laban everything that had happened. #familyreunion"
Genesis,29,14,"And Laban was like, duude, you’re totally my fam! So he stayed with Laban for, like, a whole month. A whole month of awesome days, bro!"
Genesis,29,15,"Laban was like, 'Hey, bro, I mean, since we're fam, do I really expect you to work for free? Just curious, what do you think is a fair wage for you? Let me know.'"
Genesis,29,16,"Laban had two daughters: the older one was named Leah, and the younger one was named Rachel."
Genesis,29,17,Leah was kinda sensitive; but Rachel was stunning and had mad game.
Genesis,29,18,"Jacob was totally smitten with Rachel and was like, 'I'm down to put in a solid seven years of work just to be with your younger daughter, Rachel.'"" }"
Genesis,29,19,"Laban was like, 'It's way cooler if I give her to you instead of someone else. Just hang out with me for a while.'"
Genesis,29,20,"So like, Jacob totally busted his butt working for seven years just to marry Rachel, but tbh it felt like no time at all because he was head over heels for her."
Genesis,29,21,"So Jacob was like, 'Hey Laban, it's time to give me my wife. I've been waitin' for this moment, so I can finally be with her.'"
Genesis,29,22,"So, like, Laban got all the dudes from the area and threw this huge party."
Genesis,29,23,"Later that night, he chose Leah to be his wife, and they became intimate together."
Genesis,29,24,"So, like, Laban gave his daughter Leah his maid Zilpah, right? And, like, Zilpah became Leah's handmaid or whatever."
Genesis,29,25,"The next morning, surprise surprise, it was Leah! And the guy was like, 'Dude, Laban! What did you just do to me? I worked my butt off for Rachel, not Leah! So why did you trick me like that?'"
Genesis,29,26,"Laban was like, hold up, we don't roll like that in our hood. We can't be hookin' up the youngest sibling before the eldest. (BTW, 'country' here means placee' in Hebrew.)"
Genesis,29,27,"Complete her assigned time, and we'll hook you up with something extra for the work you'll put in with me for another seven years."
Genesis,29,28,"So Jacob did that, and completed the whole week. Then he married Rachel, his daughter, too."
Genesis,29,29,"So, like, Laban, you know, he gave Bilhah, his servant, to Rachel, his daughter, to, like, be her maid and stuff."
Genesis,29,30,"And he started hanging out with Rachel too, and he totally had a major crush on her, like way more than Leah. So he ended up serving their dad for another seven whole years just to be with her."
Genesis,29,31,"And like, when the Lord peeped that Leah was not getting the love she deserved, He totally blessed her with a fertile womb, but Rachel couldn't conceive, man."
Genesis,29,32,"So, like, Leah got pregnant and had a baby boy. She named him Reuben, 'cause she was like, 'Yo, the Lord totally noticed how bummed out I was, so now my hubby will finally love me!' (BTW, Reuben means 'See a son')."
Genesis,29,33,"Then she got pregnant again and had a son. She said, 'The Lord has heard that I felt hated, so he gave me this son too.' And she named him Simeon, which means 'Hearing'."
Genesis,29,34,"Then, she got pregnant once more and gave birth to a son. She said, 'Now, finally, my husband will truly become one with me, since I've given him three sons.' That's why they named him Levi, which means 'Joined'."
Genesis,29,35,"And then she got pregnant again and had a son. She was so grateful to the LORD that she named him Judah, which means Praisee'. After that, she stopped having any more kids.""}"
Genesis,30,1,"When Rachel saw that she couldn't have any kids and her sister could, she got really jealous and said to Jacob, 'Give me kids or I literally can't even anymore.'"
Genesis,30,2,"Jacob got pretty mad at Rachel and said, 'Do I look like God? It's not me who's stopping you from having a baby, okay?'"
Genesis,30,3,"Then Rachel was like, check out my girl Bilhah, go get with her and have kids with her so they can be like my own. Like, I want them to be like a family I've built with her."
Genesis,30,4,"Then she introduced him to her handmaid Bilhah as his wife, and Jacob got close to her."
Genesis,30,5,And Bilhah got pregnant and gave birth to a son for Jacob.
Genesis,30,6,"And Rachel was like, OMG, God totally made the final verdict and actually listened to me, and now I have a little boy! So, she decided to name him Dan, which means 'Judging'. Like, it's so incredible!"
Genesis,30,7,"And then Bilhah, who was Rachel's maid, got pregnant again and gave birth to another son for Jacob."
Genesis,30,8,"Rachel was like totally like, 'OMG, I had such intense battles with my sis and I totally came out on top!' So she named her baby boy Naphtali, which means 'My wrestling' (in the Greek it's Nephthalim)."" }"
Genesis,30,9,"When Leah figured out she couldn't have any more kids, she decided to give her maid, Zilpah, to Jacob as his wife."
Genesis,30,10,"And Zilpah, who was Leah's helper, gave birth to a son for Jacob."
Genesis,30,11,"And Leah was like, 'Yo, a whole squad is pulling up!' So she named him Gad, which means 'a troop' or 'company'."
Genesis,30,12,"And then Leah's servant, Zilpah, gave birth to another son for Jacob."
Genesis,30,13,"Leah was like, 'Yo, this is so lit! All the girls gonna be givin' me mad respect and callin' me blessed.' So she named her son Asher, which means 'Happy'."
Genesis,30,14,"So Reuben was out during wheat harvest and stumbled upon some mandrakes in the field. He thought it would be a cool gift for his mom, Leah. Then Rachel comes up to Leah like, 'Hey, can I have some of those mandrakes that your son found? Pretty please?'"
Genesis,30,15,"So, like, she said to her, 'Are you seriously not satisfied with taking my husband? Now you want to take my son's mandrakes too?' And Rachel was like, 'Fine, he can spend the night with you in exchange for the mandrakes.'"" }"
Genesis,30,16,"So, like, Jacob finished his work in the field and it was getting dark outside. And Leah went out to see him, and she was like, 'Hey, come on in, we've got some business to discuss because I totally paid for your time with my son's mandrakes.' And, well, they ended up spending the night together."
Genesis,30,17,"And God listened to Leah, and she got pregnant and gave birth to Jacob's fifth son."
Genesis,30,18,"Leah was like, 'Yasss, God hooked me up with my reward because I blessed my man with my girl.' So, she named him Issachar, which means 'a reward.'"" }"
Genesis,30,19,And then Leah got pregnant again and gave birth to Jacob's sixth son.
Genesis,30,20,"Leah was stoked, like, God hooked me up with a sick dowry. Now my hubby will totally chill with me 'cause I've given him six sons. And she named the kid Zebulun, which means 'Dwelling'. (Zebulun: that's his name in Greek, means Dwelling)"
Genesis,30,21,And then she had a daughter and named her Dinah. {Dinah: which means Judgment}
Genesis,30,22,"And God was like, 'Oh hey, Rachel!' and really listened to her, and made it so she could finally have a baby."
Genesis,30,23,"And she got pregnant and gave birth to a son. She said, God has removed the shame from my life."
Genesis,30,24,"So she named him Joseph and said, Godd will bless me with another son.'"" }"
Genesis,30,25,"So, like, after Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob was all like, 'Yo Laban, I'm ready to bounce. Send me back to my home turf, you know, where I belong.'"
Genesis,30,26,"Yo, just give me my wifey and kids, man. I've been grindin' for you, you feel me? Let me bounce, 'cause you know I been puttin' in that work for you."
Genesis,30,27,"Laban was like, 'Yo, listen up. If I've totally won your favor, please don't jet just yet. I've peeped that thanks to you, the Lord has been hooking me up with blessings. No cap!"
Genesis,30,28,"And he was like, 'Tell me how much you want to get paid, and I'll make sure you get it.'"" }"
Genesis,30,29,"And he was like, yo, you know how I've been grinding for you, and how your animals were all good under my watch."
Genesis,30,30,"You didn't have much before I came, but now you have a ton of stuff. The LORD has blessed you since I arrived. So, when can I start taking care of my own house too?"
Genesis,30,31,"And he was like, 'Yo, what can I offer you?' And Jacob was like, 'Nah, you don't gotta give me anything. But if you could do me a solid and help me out with this, I'll look after and take care of your flock, bro.'"" }"
Genesis,30,32,"Today, I'll go through your whole crew and take out all the cool-looking cows and sheep that have unique patterns and colors. And I'll make sure to keep the ones with cool colors and patterns among the goats too. That's gonna be my payment."
Genesis,30,33,"In the future, my righteousness will speak for me and prove my innocence before you, like when I get paid. Anyone who isn't speckled or spotted among the goats, or brown among the sheep, will be considered stolen along with me."
Genesis,30,34,"And Laban was like, 'Yo, I'm down with what you're saying. I hope things go the way you said they would.'"" }"
Genesis,30,35,"And on that day, he decided to separate the ringstraked and spotted he-goats and the speckled and spotted she-goats, plus any with a touch of white, and all the brown sheep, and gave them to his sons to take care of."
Genesis,30,36,"So he put a three-day distance between himself and Jacob, and Jacob took care of the rest of Laban's flocks."
Genesis,30,37,"So Jacob grabbed some branches from green poplar, hazel, and chestnut trees and peeled off strips to make the white part of the branches show."
Genesis,30,38,"Then he placed the stripped branches in the water troughs where the flocks went to quench their thirst, so that they would get pregnant when they came to drink."
Genesis,30,39,"And the sheep got pregnant before the striped and spotted sticks, and gave birth to cows with stripes, spots, and speckles."
Genesis,30,40,"So, Jacob like, separated the cute little lambs and made sure the flocks looked at the cool spotty ones and the brown ones in Laban's flock. He made sure his own flocks were separate from Laban's. No mingling allowed!"
Genesis,30,41,"So, like, when the big, strong cattle were getting pregnant, Jacob placed these sticks in front of the cattle's eyes in the ditches so that they would get pregnant when they were near the sticks."
Genesis,30,42,"But when the cows were weak, he didn't put them with the rest. So the weaker ones were Laban's and the stronger ones belonged to Jacob."
Genesis,30,43,"And this dude totally thrived and had an insane amount of livestock, plus a whole crew of awesome maids and dudes, not to mention loads of camels and donkeys.""}"
Genesis,31,1,"And, like, he heard what Laban's sons were saying, like, 'Dude, Jacob totally took everything that belonged to our dad, and, like, he gained all this fame and success from what belonged to our dad.'"
Genesis,31,2,"So Jacob saw Laban's face and noticed that it wasn't the same as before. It wasn't all friendly and chill like it used to be. It was kinda awkward, you know? Like things have definitely changed."
Genesis,31,3,"God was like, 'Yo Jacob, it's time to head back to your family turf. I'll roll with you every step of the way.'"" }"
Genesis,31,4,"So Jacob hit up Rachel and Leah and told them to come out to the field where his sheep were at,"
Genesis,31,5,"And I was like, yo, I noticed how your dad's vibes towards me have changed. But the God my dad worships, He's been with me, you know?"
Genesis,31,6,And y'all know that I've dedicated all my energy in serving your dad.
Genesis,31,7,"And my dad totally played me, constantly changing up my pay like ten times, but God didn't let him mess with me."
Genesis,31,8,"He was like, 'If he said, 'Yo, you gonna get speckled animals as your wages,' then all the cattle had spots. But if he was like, 'Nah, you gonna get ringstraked animals as your pay,' then all the cattle had stripes."
Genesis,31,9,"So, like, God totally took your dad's livestock and gave it to me."
Genesis,31,10,"So, like, while the cows were getting ready to have babies, I like, looked up and had this dream. And, yo, check it out, the male sheep that were jumping on the cows, they had these cool patterns - like, some were striped, some were spotted, and some were all mixed up and speckled. Oh, and by the way, when I say 'rams,' I really mean malee goats,' just keeping it real."
Genesis,31,11,"So, like, this angel from God came to me in this dream, and he starts talking to me, calling me Jacob. And I'm just like, yo, here I am."
Genesis,31,12,"And he was like, yo, check it out, look up and see, all the rams that are jumpin' on the cattle, they're all striped, spotted, and speckled. It's 'cause I've been peepin' Laban and all the shady stuff he's been pullin' on you."
Genesis,31,13,"I'm the whole vibe of Bethel, where you did your thing with the pillar, and made a big promise to me. But now it's time to bounce from this place and go back to where your fam is at."
Genesis,31,14,"Rachel and Leah replied, 'Do we still have any share or inheritance left in our dad's crib?'"
Genesis,31,15,"Don't we feel like outsiders to him? He totally treated us like shoppers, and, man, he totally swiped all our cash too."
Genesis,31,16,"Like, all the stuff God took from our dad, it totally belongs to us and our kids too. So, if God said something to you, just do it, you know?"
Genesis,31,17,So Jacob got up and helped his sons and wives onto camels;
Genesis,31,18,"And he took all his animals and possessions that he had acquired, the animals he had acquired in Padanaram, to bring them to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan."
Genesis,31,19,Laban was out shearing his sheep and Rachel took her dad's statues. (Note: teraphim means statues in Hebrew)
Genesis,31,20,"So, Jacob decided to sneak off without telling Laban the Syrian that he was leaving. Laban had no idea that Jacob had dipped out."
Genesis,31,21,"Then he ran away with all his stuff, and he went across the river and headed towards Mount Gilead."
Genesis,31,22,Laban found out three days later that Jacob had escaped.
Genesis,31,23,"And he took his squad with him, and started chasing after him for a whole week; and finally caught up to him in the epic Mount Gilead."
Genesis,31,24,"So, like, God appeared to Laban – this Syriac dude – in a dream, right? And He was all like, 'Listen up, Laban! Don't you dare say anything good or bad to Jacob, okay?'"
Genesis,31,25,"So, Laban caught up with Jacob. Just to give you the deets, Jacob had set up his crib on the mountain. And guess what? Laban and his homies also set up camp on the mountain of Gilead."
Genesis,31,26,"Laban was like, yo Jacob, what's up with you sneaking off without me knowing and taking my daughters away like you just raided them with a sword?"
Genesis,31,27,"Why did you leave without saying anything, sneaking away from me and not giving me a chance to bid you farewell with joy, music, and celebration?"
Genesis,31,28,And you didn't let me give a proper goodbye kiss to my sons and daughters? That was a pretty dumb move on your part.
Genesis,31,29,"I totally could've messed you up, but Jacob's dad's God dropped me a message last night, telling me to keep my mouth shut when it comes to talking about Jacob, whether it's good or bad. So yeah, I won't mess with him."
Genesis,31,30,"And now, even though you really wanted to go back to your father's house, why did you take my gods?"
Genesis,31,31,"And Jacob was like, 'Dude, I spoke up to Laban 'cause I was low-key scared, ya know? I had this feeling in my gut that he might straight up snatch his daughters away from me, no cap.'"" }"
Genesis,31,32,"If you find your gods with anyone, don't let them live; first, figure out what belongs to you and take it back. Jacob didn't realize that Rachel had taken them."
Genesis,31,33,"So Laban checked out Jacob's tent, then Leah's tent, and even the tents of the two maidservants, but he couldn't find them anywhere. So he left Leah's tent and went straight into Rachel's tent."
Genesis,31,34,"Okay, so Rachel had discreetly grabbed those images and cleverly hidden them among the camel's stuff, just to throw everyone off. Then she casually plopped herself down on top of them. Well, Laban was pretty determined to find those things, so he thoroughly checked every nook and cranny of the entire tent. But he couldn't find them anywhere. (By the way, when it says 'searched' it actually means Laban was basically feeling around for them.)"
Genesis,31,35,"So she told her dad, ""Please don't be upset that I can't get up in front of you, cause, you know, it's that time of the month for me. And he looked around, but couldn't find the stuff he was looking for."
Genesis,31,36,"Jacob got really mad and started arguing with Laban: he said to Laban, 'What did I do wrong? What sin did I commit that you're coming after me so aggressively?'"
Genesis,31,37,"So, you've gone through all my things, but what have you actually found that belongs to you? Bring it here, right in front of our friends and family, so they can decide who it really belongs to. 🧐"
Genesis,31,38,"Bruh, I've been by your side for a hot minute, like, twenty years straight. And guess what? Your ewes and she goats haven't had any miscarriages, and I haven't even touched those rams from your flock. No cap."
Genesis,31,39,"I didn't bring any torn stuff from animals to you, I took the loss upon myself. You demanded it from me, whether it was stolen during the day or at night."
Genesis,31,40,"Like, it was totally rough. I mean, during the day I was so parched, like everything was dry and there was no water to be found. And then at night, it was freezing cold, like frosty, you know? And on top of all that, I couldn't even catch a wink of sleep, man. It was straight up gone from my eyes."
Genesis,31,41,"So, like, I've spent, like, a whole two decades working for you, man. I mean, I slaved away for, like, fourteen years just to marry your two daughters, and then another six years, like, taking care of your livestock. And, dude, you changed my paycheck, like, ten freaking times! Can you even believe it?"
Genesis,31,42,"If it wasn't for the God my dad, the God of Abraham, and the respect for Isaac, I would have definitely been kicked out without anything. God saw the hard times I went through and the work I put in, and gave you a real talking-to last night."
Genesis,31,43,"Laban replied to Jacob, 'Bro, these girls are my girls, these kids are my kids, and all these animals are mine too. Everything you see here belongs to me. So, what can I do today to bless these girls and their children?'"
Genesis,31,44,"So, like, let's make a deal, you and me. It'll be, like, a special bond that shows we're, you know, in this together."
Genesis,31,45,So Jacob grabbed a stone and placed it there as a monument.
Genesis,31,46,"So Jacob said to his bros, 'Yo, let's gather some rocks.' And they were like, 'Sure, cool,' and gathered rocks and made a big pile. Then, they all sat on the pile and had a chill meal together."
Genesis,31,47,"Laban named it Jegarsahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed. (Jegarsahadutha means 'heap of witness' in Chaldee, while Galeed means 'heap of witness' in Hebrew.)"
Genesis,31,48,"Laban was like, yo, this big pile of rocks is a legit witness between us today. So, we're gonna call it Galeed, just so we remember this all happened."
Genesis,31,49,"And Mizpah, you know? 'Cause like, I'm saying, may the LORD look out for us when we're not together, you feel me? Mizpah, it's like a symbol of being able to keep an eye out, like a beacon or a watchtower."
Genesis,31,50,"If you mess with my daughters or try to marry other women besides them, it's just gonna be me and you, no one else. God is watching everything between us, no doubt about it."
Genesis,31,51,"Laban was like, 'Yo, check out this dope stack of rocks and this sick pillar I set up between you and me, Jacob.'"
Genesis,31,52,"Yo, check it. This pile right here, and this rock right here, they're legit proof that I won't trespass onto your turf, and you won't come over to mine, with any ill intentions or negativity."
Genesis,31,53,"May the Supreme Being of Abraham and Nahor, the Supreme Being of their father, mediate between us. And Jacob solemnly affirmed by the reverence for his father Isaac."
Genesis,31,54,"So Jacob went ahead and made a big feast on the mountain, inviting all his peeps to come chill and grub with him. They had a good meal together and decided to crash there for the night on the mountain. #GoodVibesOnly"
Genesis,31,55,"The next morning, Laban got up, gave his sons and daughters a goodbye kiss, and blessed them. Then Laban said his goodbyes and went back home.""}"
Genesis,32,1,"So Jacob was just doing his thing, when he bumped into some angels sent by God."
Genesis,32,2,"And when Jacob peeped them, he was like, yo, this is straight up God's squad right here. So he named that spot Mahanaim, which means two crews or two camps."
Genesis,32,3,"So Jacob DM'd some messengers to Esau, his bro, in the land of Seir, the place where Edom was. {country: Hebrew for field}"
Genesis,32,4,"So, like, he told them to, like, talk to my dude Esau and be all respectful and stuff. Jacob, your bro, is like, 'Yo, I've been crashing at Laban's place for a while, but now I'm here, ya know?'"
Genesis,32,5,"So, like, I have these oxen, asses, flocks, and a bunch of people working for me, you know? And I just wanted to let my lord know, because I'm all about that honesty and respect, that I hope I can earn your favor and be on your good side."
Genesis,32,6,"Yo, the messengers went back to Jacob and were like, 'We found your bro Esau, and guess what? He's heading towards you with a crew of four hundred dudes.'"" }"
Genesis,32,7,"So Jacob got really scared and stressed out. He split up his crew, along with their flocks, herds, and camels, into two groups."
Genesis,32,8,"And he was like, if Esau pulls up on one group and starts wrecking them, then the other group that's left will be able to make a clean getaway."
Genesis,32,9,"Jacob was like, yo God, the one my pops Abraham and Isaac worshipped, you know that guy who told me to go back home to my fam and promised to hook me up?"
Genesis,32,10,"I can't even begin to express how grateful I am for all the kindness and truth you've shown me. From the bottom of my heart, I am blown away by your blessings. Coming from such humble beginnings, I've managed to overcome obstacles and now I've become successful in two different areas of my life. (To think, I actually believed I was the lowest of the low, but now I realize I was even worse than that.)"
Genesis,32,11,"Yo, please save me from my bro Esau, 'cause I'm scared he's gonna straight up hit me and the whole fam. No cap."
Genesis,32,12,"And you were like, 'I got you, I'll totally hook you up and make your fam as countless as the sand on the beach.'"" }"
Genesis,32,13,"So, like, he stayed there overnight and, you know, grabbed some of his stuff to give as a gift to his bro Esau."
Genesis,32,14,"So, like, they had 200 she goats, and 20 he goats, you know? And also, there were 200 ewes, along with 20 rams, man!"
Genesis,32,15,"Like, there were 30 camels that could produce milk, along with their cute little babies. And there were 40 cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys, and 10 baby donkeys. How cool is that?!"
Genesis,32,16,"Then he gave the animals to his workers, instructing them to split them up into separate groups. He said to his workers, 'Go ahead of me and leave a gap between each group.'"" }"
Genesis,32,17,"Then he told the first guy, 'Yo, when Esau, my bro, sees you, he's gonna ask you like, who the heck are you? Where are you headed? And who are all these people with you?'"
Genesis,32,18,"So like, you should totally be like, 'Yo, these are like the gifts from your boy Jacob, my dude. It's a little something I'm sending to my bro Esau. Oh, and just to let you know, he's still chilling behind us.'"" }"
Genesis,32,19,"So, he told the second, the third, and everyone else in the group, saying, 'This is how you should talk to Esau when you see him.'"" }"
Genesis,32,20,"And let me just add, like, check it out, our boy Jacob is right behind us. 'Cause he was like, yo, I'll bring him a gift before I show up, and maybe then he'll be cool with me and accept me, you know what I mean?"
Genesis,32,21,"So the gift was given to him in advance, and he stayed overnight with the crew."
Genesis,32,22,"So, like, this guy got up in the middle of the night and, like, took his two wives, two women who were serving him, and his eleven sons, and, you know, crossed over this place called the ford Jabbok."
Genesis,32,23,"So he gathered them up and made them cross the stream, along with all they had. {caused to pass: Hebrew meaning sent them}"
Genesis,32,24,"So Jacob found himself all by himself, when suddenly a man came and started wrestling with him. They wrestled all the way until the morning sun began to rise."
Genesis,32,25,"But since he couldn't defeat Jacob, he decided to play dirty and gave him a sneaky swipe at the thigh. This move messed up Jacob's thigh and put it out of joint while they were wrestling."
Genesis,32,26,"And he was like, bro, it's getting light out, so lemme bounce. But the other guy was like, nah dude, I'm not lettin' you go unless you give me a blessing, yo."
Genesis,32,27,"Then he asked him, 'Yo, what's your name?' And he replied, 'I'm Jacob.'"" }"
Genesis,32,28,"And he was like, dude, you're not gonna be called Jacob anymore, but Israel. Because you've got this total power move with God and with people, and you've totally won. Israel means, like, a prince of God, by the way."
Genesis,32,29,"So Jacob was like, 'Hey dude, what's your name?' And the guy was like, 'Why do you wanna know?' But then he blessed Jacob right then and there."
Genesis,32,30,"And Jacob was like, 'Yo, I'mma name this place Peniel, 'cause I straight up saw God face to face, and I'm alive and kickin', man. Peniel means 'The face of God,' in case you were wondering."
Genesis,32,31,"And as he was walking through Penuel, the sun came up, and he stopped and started limping."
Genesis,32,32,"So, like, the Israelites still don't eat this specific part of the animal, you know, the sinew that shrank that's on the thigh. They've been doing this since the time when Jacob's thigh got touched and the sinew shrank.""}"
Genesis,33,1,"So Jacob glanced up and saw that Esau was approaching with four hundred guys. Then he sorted out his children, giving some to Leah, some to Rachel, and some to the two maid servants."
Genesis,33,2,"And he made sure the handmaids and their kids were in the front, followed by Leah and her kids, and Rachel and Joseph were at the back."
Genesis,33,3,"Then he walked up in front of them, and respectfully bowed down to the ground seven times, until he got close to his brother."
Genesis,33,4,"And Esau quickly went up to meet Jacob, giving him a big hug, holding him close, and planting a heartfelt kiss on his cheek. They couldn't help but shed tears of joy together."
Genesis,33,5,"Then he looked up and saw the women and children, and he asked, 'Who are these people with you?' And he replied, 'They are the children that God has blessed me with.'"" }"
Genesis,33,6,"After that, the handmaidens approached, along with their children, and they humbly bowed down."
Genesis,33,7,"Then Leah and her squad rolled up and showed some respect. And right after, Joseph and Rachel stepped up and paid their respects too."
Genesis,33,8,"And he was like, 'Yo, bro, what's up with all these animals I came across?' And the guy was like, 'I brought them to gain favor with my lord, dude.' So, the guy was basically asking why the other dude had a bunch of animals with him."
Genesis,33,9,"Esau was like, yo bro, I'm good. Keep whatever you got for yourself."
Genesis,33,10,"And Jacob was like, yo, if I'm chillin' with you and you think I'm cool, can you accept this gift from me? 'Cause when I see you, it's like I'm seeing God, and you're vibin' with me."
Genesis,33,11,"Yo, dude, please accept this blessing I'm bringing you. It's all good, 'cause God has been so kind to me, and I'm totally content with what I have. I insist, bro, take it. It's all yours."
Genesis,33,12,"And he was like, 'Yo, let's hit the road and go on this journey together, and I'll lead the way, fam."
Genesis,33,13,"And he said to him, Bro, you know that the younglings and the lil' animals are delicate out here. If we push 'em too hard for even just a day, the whole crew could end up wiped out."
Genesis,33,14,"Yo, my dude, please let me go ahead of you at a slow pace, so that I can make sure the animals and the kids can handle it until I reach you in Seir. Gonna match their speed and stamina, you know what I mean?"
Genesis,33,15,"Esau was like, 'Hey, can some of my crew roll with you?' But Jacob was all like, 'No need, bro. Just let me earn your favor, yo.'"" }"
Genesis,33,16,So Esau went back that day on his journey to Seir.
Genesis,33,17,"So Jacob went to Succoth and built himself a sick house, and made some cozy spots for his animals. That's why the place is called Succoth, which means booths."
Genesis,33,18,"So Jacob arrived in Shalem, a cool city in Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, after travelling all the way from Padanaram. He set up his tent right outside the city. (Fun fact: Shechem is also known as Sychem in Greek!)"
Genesis,33,19,"So, he decided to buy a piece of land, where he had set up his tent, from the descendants of Hamor, who was Shechem's dad. He paid a hundred pieces of money for it. (Hamor is also known as Emmor, and by 'pieces of money' they mean lambs.)"
Genesis,33,20,"Then he set up an altar and named it Elelohe-Israel. (Elelohe-Israel means God, the God of Israel)""}"
Genesis,34,1,"So, Dinah, who was Leah's daughter and Jacob's child, decided to check out the local girls."
Genesis,34,2,"So, like, Shechem, this dude from the Hivite crew, who was, like, the boss of that area, saw her and straight-up took her and hooked up with her, totally disrespecting her. (BTW, 'defiled' means, like, he humbled her, just saying.)"
Genesis,34,3,"And he was really into Dinah, Jacob's daughter. He had mad love for her and treated her with so much respect and affection."
Genesis,34,4,"So Shechem went to his dad Hamor and said, 'Yo, hook me up with that girl as my wifey.'"" }"
Genesis,34,5,"So, Jacob found out that someone had disrespected his daughter, Dinah. At that time, his sons were out in the field taking care of their animals. Jacob kept quiet about it until they came back."
Genesis,34,6,"So Hamor, Shechem's dad, went to hang out with Jacob and have a chat."
Genesis,34,7,"And when Jacob's boys came back from the outdoor hangout and found out about it, they were really upset and mad. They couldn't believe that this dude had done something so dumb as sleeping with Jacob's daughter. That's totally not cool and definitely not something you should do."
Genesis,34,8,"So Hamor was talking to them and he said, 'My son Shechem is totally into your daughter. I hope you consider letting them get together.'"" }"
Genesis,34,9,"So, like, let's, you know, join families and have relationships. Give us your daughters and we'll give you ours, you feel?"
Genesis,34,10,"And you can totally live with us, and the land is yours to explore and settle in. Feel free to set up shop and make a living here, gaining all the stuff you need."
Genesis,34,11,"And Shechem was like, yo, pops and bros, please chill with me and if you're cool with me, I'll hook you up with whatever you want."
Genesis,34,12,"If you want a big dowry or lots of gifts, just tell me what you want and I'll give it, but all I ask in return is to marry the girl."
Genesis,34,13,"So, like, Jacob's boys, they totally gave Shechem and Hamor, his dad, a fake response, you know? They were all upset 'cause Shechem had, like, disrespected their sister, Dinah:"
Genesis,34,14,"And they told them, 'Sorry, but we can't do that. We can't give our sister to someone who hasn't been circumcised. It would bring shame upon us.'"" }"
Genesis,34,15,"But here's the deal, we're cool with you, as long as you're cool with us. If you're down to do what we do, then all the guys among you gotta get circumcised, ya know?"
Genesis,34,16,"So, like, we'll totally hook you up with our daughters, and you can hook us up with your daughters, and we'll chill together and become one big fam."
Genesis,34,17,"But if you guys don't listen and get circumcised, then we'll just leave with our daughter."
Genesis,34,18,"And what they said made Hamor and Shechem, Hamor's son, pretty stoked."
Genesis,34,19,"And the young man didn't hesitate to do it, because he really liked Jacob's daughter. Plus, he was even more respected than anyone else in his father's household."
Genesis,34,20,"So, Hamor and his son Shechem went to the city gate and had a chat with all the dudes in their city. They were like,"
Genesis,34,21,"These dudes are chill with us, so let's let them hang around in our hood and do business there. The land is big enough for all of us, you know? We can marry their daughters and they can marry ours, like a cool mix and match situation."
Genesis,34,22,"So, like, the deal is, these guys are cool with joining our squad and being one of us, but only if all of our dudes get circumcised, you know, like they are."
Genesis,34,23,"Yo, shouldn't we, like, totally claim their livestock, their possessions, and all their animals as ours? We just gotta make a deal with them, and they'll totally live among us, no problem."
Genesis,34,24,"So, like, all the dudes who lived in Hamor and Shechem's city were totally down for what they had to say. And, get this, they all decided to get circumcised! Every single one of them, no joke."
Genesis,34,25,"So, like, on the third day, when they were super upset, Simeon and Levi, the brothers of Dinah, they grabbed their swords and straight up went to the city without fear, and like, they killed all the guys there."
Genesis,34,26,"So, they killed Hamor and Shechem's son by going all in with their sword, snatched Dinah from Shechem's place, and bounced. {edge: (original Hebrew means 'mouth')}""}"
Genesis,34,27,"The bros of Jacob found out what went down and looted the city as payback for what they did to their sis. No respect, man."
Genesis,34,28,"So, like, they gathered up all their sheep, oxen, and donkeys, along with everything they had in the city and in the fields."
Genesis,34,29,"And they captured all of their belongings, including their children, wives, and everything that was in their house."
Genesis,34,30,"Jacob was like, 'Yo, Simeon and Levi, you totally messed things up! You made me look bad in front of the people in this land, the Canaanites and Perizzites. Because of your actions, they're gonna gather up against me and my crew, and probably end up killing us. We're totally gonna get wiped out!"
Genesis,34,31,"And they were like, um, should he treat our sis like some kind of party girl?""}"
Genesis,35,1,"Yo, Jacob, listen up! God said to get up and head over to Bethel. Settle down there and build an altar to honor God, the one who showed up when you were running away from your bro, Esau."
Genesis,35,2,"Then Jacob was like, yo, listen up everyone in his crew. We gotta ditch those sketchy gods you got hidden in your stuff. Time to purify ourselves and put on some fresh threads, ya know?"
Genesis,35,3,"So, let's get up and head to Bethel. There, I'm gonna build an altar for God, who totally had my back when things got rough and stuck with me every step of the way."
Genesis,35,4,"So they handed over to Jacob all the gods they had, you know, those foreign ones, and also their cool earrings they had in their ears. And Jacob, being all smart about it, he hid them under this oak tree that was by Shechem."
Genesis,35,5,"So they kept moving, and the awe-inspiring power of God fell upon the neighboring cities, causing them not to chase after Jacob's sons."
Genesis,35,6,"So Jacob went to Luz, which is in Canaan, also known as Bethel, with all his crew that were with him."
Genesis,35,7,"And he made, like, this sick altar there and named the place Elbethel, ‘cause that's where God showed up to him when he was running away from his bro. Elbethel, like, means the God of Bethel or something."
Genesis,35,8,"Deborah, the nurse of Rebekah, sadly passed away and her final resting place was beneath a beautiful oak tree near Bethel. This sacred oak tree was given the name Allonbachuth, meaning 'The oak of weeping', as a tribute to her memory."
Genesis,35,9,"So like, God showed up to Jacob once again, right after he left Padanaram, and totally blessed him."
Genesis,35,10,"So, God was like, 'Hey, dude! From now on, you're gonna be called Israel, not Jacob. That's gonna be your new name.' And he actually changed his name to Israel."
Genesis,35,11,"And God was like, yo dude, I'm God Almighty - no one can top me. So here's the deal: have lots of kids, build a whole nation, even multiple nations, and some legit kings are gonna come from your bloodline, bro."
Genesis,35,12,"And yo, that land I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I'm gonna give it to you, and to your homies after you. It's gonna be their turf too."
Genesis,35,13,And God bounced from him at the spot where they had a chat.
Genesis,35,14,"So Jacob placed a cool-looking stone thingy where he had a deep convo with God. And he poured some fruity drink and trendy oil on it, you know, to show his respect and gratitude."
Genesis,35,15,So Jacob named the place where God spoke to him Bethel.
Genesis,35,16,"So they left Bethel and it wasn't too far until they reached Ephrath. And let me tell you, Rachel was going through it - she was in intense pain and laboring hard. It wasn't an easy situation, that's for sure."
Genesis,35,17,"So, while she was going through a really tough time giving birth, the midwife reassured her, like, 'Don't stress, don't worry. You're gonna have another son.'"" }"
Genesis,35,18,"As she took her last breath and passed away, she decided to name her baby boy Benoni, which means 'The son of my sorrow.' However, his father renamed him Benjamin, which means 'The son of the right hand.'"
Genesis,35,19,"And, like, Rachel passed away and they laid her to rest on the road to Ephrath, which is, like, Bethlehem."
Genesis,35,20,"So Jacob placed a monument on Rachel's grave. It's still there to this day, known as Rachel's monument."
Genesis,35,21,So Israel moved on and set up his tent past the tower of Edar.
Genesis,35,22,"So, like, while Israel was living in that place, Reuben, one of Jacob's sons, hooked up with Bilhah, who was, like, his dad's concubine. And, man, Jacob found out about it. Just so you know, Jacob had twelve sons in total:"
Genesis,35,23,"Here are Leah's kids: Reuben, the oldest, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun."
Genesis,35,24,Rachel had two sons named Joseph and Benjamin:
Genesis,35,25,"And Rachel, like, had these two kids through her handmaid Bilhah: Dan and Naphtali, ya know?"
Genesis,35,26,"And the sons of Zilpah, who was Leah's BFF; Gad and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him during his time in Padanaram."
Genesis,35,27,"So Jacob went to his dad Isaac in Hebron, which is also called Mamre, the same place where Abraham and Isaac had stayed for a while."
Genesis,35,28,"Isaac lived for like, a super long time, you know? He reached the epic age of a hundred and eighty years. Can you believe it?!"
Genesis,35,29,"And Isaac passed away peacefully, and he died, joining his ancestors, as an elder who lived a long and fulfilling life. His sons Esau and Jacob laid him to rest with reverence.""}"
Genesis,36,1,"So, here's the deal: let's talk about Esau, who's also known as Edom. Here's his backstory, fam."
Genesis,36,2,"Esau married women from the Canaanite families. He married Adah, who was a daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah, who was a daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite."
Genesis,36,3,"And Bashemath, who was Ishmael's daughter and Nebajoth's sister. {Bashemath: or, Mahalath}"
Genesis,36,4,"And Adah had a son named Eliphaz with Esau, while Bashemath had a son named Reuel."
Genesis,36,5,"So, Aholibamah had Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. These are the kids of Esau that were born to him when he was living in Canaan."
Genesis,36,6,"So Esau gathered up his wives, kids, and everyone in his household, along with his livestock, pets, and all his possessions that he had acquired in Canaan. He decided to move away to a different place to avoid his brother Jacob's presence. (Note: 'persons' in Hebrew means 'souls')"" }"
Genesis,36,7,"Their wealth was too great for them to live in harmony, and the land where they had settled couldn't sustain them and their livestock."
Genesis,36,8,"So Esau made his home in Mount Seir, and he became known as Edom."
Genesis,36,9,"So, here's the rundown of Esau, he's the big guy who fathered the Edomites, you know, those peeps living in mount Seir. Oh, FYI, Edomites means Edom in Hebrew."
Genesis,36,10,"Here's a list of Esau's sons: Eliphaz, who was born to Adah, Esau's wife, and Reuel, who was born to Bashemath, Esau's other wife."
Genesis,36,11,"Eliphaz had sons named Teman, Omar, Zepho (also known as Zephi), Gatam, and Kenaz."
Genesis,36,12,"Timna was kinda like a side piece to Eliphaz, who was Esau's son. And she ended up having a kid with Eliphaz named Amalek. So basically, Amalek was one of the sons of Adah, who was actually Esau's wife."
Genesis,36,13,"So, Reuel had a crew of sons: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. They were all from Bashemath, Esau's wifey."
Genesis,36,14,"These are the kids of Aholibamah, who was Anah's daughter and Zibeon's granddaughter. Aholibamah was Esau's wife and she gave birth to Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah."
Genesis,36,15,"These were the OG leaders of Esau's crew: Eliphaz, Esau's oldest bro, was the top dawg. He had his homies Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Kenaz as his right-hand men."
Genesis,36,16,"Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these were the leaders who came from Eliphaz in the land of Edom; they were the sons of Adah."
Genesis,36,17,"These are the guys Reuel, who is Esau's son, had: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah were like the bosses. They were the important dudes in Reuel's crew in the land of Edom. Bashemath, who was Esau's wife, had these sons."
Genesis,36,18,"And these are the guys that Aholibamah, Esau's wife, had: Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. They were the leaders who descended from Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah and Esau's wife."
Genesis,36,19,"So, these are the descendants of Esau, commonly known as Edom, and these are their leaders."
Genesis,36,20,"These dudes were the sons of Seir the Horite, who were living in that land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, and Anah,"
Genesis,36,21,"And there were Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan: they were the big shots of the Horites, the children of Seir from the land of Edom."
Genesis,36,22,"The kids of Lotan were Hori and Hemam, and Lotan had a sister named Timna. Hemam can also be called Homam."
Genesis,36,23,"And Shobal had these cool kids: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. Alvan could also be called Alian. Shepho's alternative name is Shephi."
Genesis,36,24,These are the offspring of Zibeon: Ajah and Anah. Anah was the one who came across some cool mules while taking care of his dad Zibeon's donkeys in the wilderness.
Genesis,36,25,"The homies from Anah had these kids; Dishon and Aholibamah, who was Anah's daughter."
Genesis,36,26,"Here are the names of Dishon's children: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran. Hemdan could also be called Amram."
Genesis,36,27,"Here are the kids of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan (also known as Jakan)."" }"
Genesis,36,28,These are the descendants of Dishan: Uz and Aran.
Genesis,36,29,"These were the major influencers of the Horite community - there was Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, and Anah."
Genesis,36,30,"Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, and duke Dishan were the big shots from the crew called Hori, among the other influential peeps in the land of Seir."
Genesis,36,31,"So, there were these kings who ruled over the land of Edom. Way before any king ruled over the children of Israel, ya feel me?"
Genesis,36,32,"So like, this dude named Bela, Beor's son, was like the boss in Edom, you know? And his city, it was called Dinhabah and stuff."
Genesis,36,33,"Bela passed away, and then Jobab, Zerah's son from Bozrah, took over as the ruler."
Genesis,36,34,"And Jobab passed away, and Husham from the land of Temani took over as ruler in his place."
Genesis,36,35,"So, Husham passed away and then Hadad, the son of Bedad, became the ruler. Hadad led the victorious attack against the Midianites in the Moab region. His city was called Avith."
Genesis,36,36,"And Hadad passed away, and Samlah of Masrekah took over as ruler."
Genesis,36,37,"Then Samlah passed away, and Saul from Rehoboth took over as ruler near the river."
Genesis,36,38,"And like, Saul passed away, you know, and then Baalhanan, Achbor's son, took over as king, totally stepping into his shoes."
Genesis,36,39,"So yeah, Baalhanan, Achbor's son, passed away and Hadar took over as ruler. Hadar's city was called Pau, and his wife's name was Mehetabel, who was the daughter of Matred and the granddaughter of Mezahab. Just a heads up, after Hadar, things went down a whole different political path."
Genesis,36,40,"And these are the cool kids who were part of Esau's crew, representing their families, their territories, and their names. We got Timnah, the ultimate duke, Alvah, the boss duke, and Jetheth, the duke with serious style. (Alvah is also known as Aliah, just so you know.)"
Genesis,36,41,"Dope Aholibamah, Elah the homie, Pinon the legend,"
Genesis,36,42,"Duke Kenaz, Duke Teman, Duke Mibzar,"
Genesis,36,43,"Duke Magdiel and duke Iram were the top guys of Edom, living in their own spots within the land they owned. Esau, the dad of the Edomites, was in charge. (The Edomites were from Edom, just so you know.)""}"
Genesis,37,1,"So Jacob lived in the land where his dad was just visiting, in Canaan."
Genesis,37,2,"So, here's the deal, this is the story of Jacob's fam. Joseph, who was just a kid of seventeen, was hangin' out with his bros and taking care of the flock. He was chillin' with the sons of his dad's wives, Bilhah and Zilpah. And one day, Joseph goes and tells his pops about the shady stuff they were up to."
Genesis,37,3,"Israel was totally vibing with Joseph and showed him mad love, since he was his favorite child and was born when Israel was getting up there in age. He even hooked Joseph up with this sick coat, decked out in all sorts of rad colors."
Genesis,37,4,"And when his siblings noticed that their dad liked him way more than them, they straight up hated him and couldn't even have a chill convo with him."
Genesis,37,5,"So Joseph had this dream, and he decided to share it with his bros. But instead of being stoked about it, they got even more salty and started hating on him even harder."
Genesis,37,6,"Yo, listen up, fam! Check out this dream I had, alright?"
Genesis,37,7,"So listen up, I was out in the field, bundling up the wheat. And get this, my bundle of wheat stood up tall and proud. And guess what? Your bundles of wheat gathered around and bowed down to mine!"
Genesis,37,8,"And his siblings were like, seriously, are you gonna be our ruler? Like, are you gonna boss us around? And they hated him even more because he would always talk about his dreams and what they meant."
Genesis,37,9,"So, like, Joseph had another dream and he was all like, 'Hey fam, listen up! I had this crazy dream where the sun, moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.'"" }"
Genesis,37,10,"So he goes and tells his dad and siblings about it, and his dad isn't too thrilled. He's like, 'What's up with this dream you had? You really think me, your mom, and your siblings are gonna bow down to you? Like, seriously?'"
Genesis,37,11,"And his siblings were totally jealous of him, but his dad totally took note of what was going on."
Genesis,37,12,So his squad went to take care of their dad's animals in Shechem.
Genesis,37,13,"Israel was like, 'Yo Joseph, aren't your brothers supposed to be chillin' with the flock in Shechem? Go find them, I'll send you over.' Joseph was all like, 'For sure, here I am.'"" }"
Genesis,37,14,"Yo, listen up! He told him, 'Hey, can you do me a solid and check in on your brothers and see how they're doing, along with the flock? Let me know how everything's going.' So he sent him away from Hebron and he made his way to Shechem. You feel me?"
Genesis,37,15,"So this guy came across him, and it turns out he was just wandering around in the field. The guy approached him and was like, 'Hey, what are you looking for?'"
Genesis,37,16,"And he was like, yo, where my bros at? Can you please let me know where they hang and chill with their flocks?"
Genesis,37,17,"The guy was like, 'Yo, those dudes bounced! I overheard them saying, 'Let's hit up Dothan.'"" So Joseph was like, 'Bet,' and went to find his brothers, and ended up locating them in Dothan."
Genesis,37,18,"So, like, when they spotted him from a distance, way before he even got close to them, they got all schemey and planned to straight up kill the dude."
Genesis,37,19,"And they were like, listen, here comes the guy who thinks he's the ultimate expert in dreams. {dreamer: Hebrew meaning 'master of dreams'}"
Genesis,37,20,"Yo, let's do something about this, like totally take him out and throw him into a pit. Then we'll be like, 'Oh no, some savage creature just chowed down on him!' It'll be so interesting to see what happens to his dreams after that."
Genesis,37,21,"Reuben heard what was up, so he saved him from their clutches and was like, 'Nah, let's not take this to the extreme and end his life.'"
Genesis,37,22,"And Reuben was like, 'Yo, don't straight up kill him or anything, just chuck him into this random pit in the middle of nowhere, and don't you dare touch him! The plan is to save him from their hands and eventually reunite him with his dad.'"" }"
Genesis,37,23,"So, like, Joseph went to hang with his bros and they straight up took off his cool rainbow coat he was wearing, you know, the one with all the colors. It was a pretty swag outfit, no cap."
Genesis,37,24,"So they grabbed him and tossed him into a pit, and guess what? The pit was totally dry, not a drop of water in sight."
Genesis,37,25,"So, they were just chilling, about to feast on some bread, when they suddenly spotted a gang of Ishmeelites coming from Gilead. These peeps were rollin' with their camels loaded up with spices, balm, and myrrh, all set to take it down to Egypt."
Genesis,37,26,"Judah was like, yo bros, what's the point if we kill our own brother and then hide the evidence?"
Genesis,37,27,"Hey, let's sell him to the Ishmeelites instead of hurting him ourselves, because he's our own flesh and blood. His brothers agreed with the plan."
Genesis,37,28,"So, like, these Midianite merchant guys were passing by, right? And they saw Joseph stuck in this pit and were all like, 'Nah, we'll help the dude out.' But instead of setting him free, they sold him to the Ishmaelites for, like, twenty pieces of silver. And off they went, taking Joseph all the way to Egypt."
Genesis,37,29,"So Reuben went back to the pit where they had left Joseph, but guess what? Joseph wasn't there anymore! Reuben became totally distraught and tore his clothes in despair."
Genesis,37,30,"So he went back to his buddies and was like, 'Guys, the kid's gone! And now, where do I even go?'"
Genesis,37,31,"So, like, they grabbed Joseph's sick coat, and then they straight up took a baby goat, killed it, and dunked the coat in its blood, man."
Genesis,37,32,"So they sent that sick jacket their brother wore and delivered it to their dad, saying, 'Yo, check it out. We found this. Can you confirm if it's your son's swag or what?'"
Genesis,37,33,"He found out what happened and said, 'This is my son's jacket; a wild animal definitely attacked him and Joseph is undoubtedly torn apart!'"
Genesis,37,34,"So Jacob, like, tore his clothes and put on some sackcloth and was totally mourning for his son for a long time."
Genesis,37,35,"And all his homies and all his besties came to support him; but he didn't want to feel better; and he was like, 'Nah, I'm gonna stay sad 'til I join my son in the afterlife.' So his dad cried a lot for him."
Genesis,37,36,"So, like, the Midianites totally sold him off to Egypt, to this dude named Potiphar, who was like a super important officer in Pharaoh's squad. And, yo, he was the head honcho of the whole guard crew. By the way, this word 'officer' can mean eunuch, but it also includes chamberlains, courtiers, and other high-ranking peeps. And 'captain of the guard' can also be translated as the chief marshal, chief of the slaughter men, or executioners. Pretty intense, right?""}"
Genesis,38,1,"So, there was this moment when Judah decided to separate himself from his brothers and headed over to this Adullamite dude named Hirah."
Genesis,38,2,"So, Judah noticed this Canaanite girl named Shuah and decided to get close to her and be intimate with her."
Genesis,38,3,And she got pregnant and gave birth to a son; and he named him Er.
Genesis,38,4,"And then she got pregnant again and gave birth to a son, and she named him Onan."
Genesis,38,5,"And then she got pregnant again, and gave birth to a son. She named him Shelah. He was born in Chezib."
Genesis,38,6,"And Judah found a partner for his oldest son, Er, and her name was Tamar."
Genesis,38,7,"Er, who was the oldest son of Judah, did things that were seen as wrong by the LORD, so the LORD caused him to die."
Genesis,38,8,"And Judah told Onan, 'Yo bro, go sleep with your brother's wife and be her husband, so that you can have kids in his name.'"" }"
Genesis,38,9,"And Onan realized that the offspring wouldn't be considered his own. So, when he slept with his brother's wife, he intentionally wasted it on the ground to prevent her from getting pregnant and continuing his brother's family line."
Genesis,38,10,"And what he did was not cool with the LORD, so he ended up taking him out too. {not cool...: In the Hebrew text, it says it was bad in the eyes of the Lord}"
Genesis,38,11,"So Judah told his daughter-in-law Tamar, 'Stay at your father's place as a widow until my son Shelah grows up, because I'm afraid he might end up like his brothers who died.' So Tamar went and lived at her father's house."
Genesis,38,12,"After some time, Shuah's daughter, who was married to Judah, sadly passed away. Judah mourned her loss but eventually found solace and decided to go up to Timnath with his buddy Hirah the Adullamite to watch over his sheep and get some work done. (By the way, 'in process of time' just means a while had passed.)"
Genesis,38,13,Tamar heard the news that her father-in-law was heading to Timnath to shear his sheep.
Genesis,38,14,"And she changed out of her widow's clothes and put on a veil, wrapping herself up. Then she sat in a public place along the road to Timnath. She did this because she noticed that Shelah had grown up, but she wasn't being given to him as his wife. (This public place was known as the Door of Eyes or Enajim.)"
Genesis,38,15,"When Judah saw her, he assumed she was a sex worker because she had her face covered."
Genesis,38,16,"And he saw her on the way and said, like, hey, can I come over to your place? (he didn't know she was his daughter-in-law). And she was like, what's in it for me if you come in?"
Genesis,38,17,"And he was like, yo, I'll hook you up with a cute lil baby goat from my flock. And she was like, hold up, can you gimme something as a guarantee until you actually send it? You know, like a deposit or something? (btw, when it says 'kid', it means a baby goat, just a lil FYI)"
Genesis,38,18,"And he was like, 'What can I give you as a sign of trust?' And she was all, 'Give me your cool ring, your stylish bracelets, and that rad staff you're holding.' So yeah, he handed them over, hooked up with her, and boom! She got pregnant."
Genesis,38,19,"Then she got up, left, took off her head covering, and put on the clothes for mourning."
Genesis,38,20,"So Judah sent his buddy from Adullam to pick up the stuff he left with that woman, but he couldn't find her."
Genesis,38,21,"So he asked the guys there, like, 'Where's that girl who was, like, standing out in the open on the side of the road?' And they were all 'Oh, there wasn't any girl like that in this place, at all.'"" }"
Genesis,38,22,"So he went back to Judah and was like, 'Yo, I couldn't find her.' And the dudes from that spot were like, 'Nah, bro, there ain't no sex workers here.'"" }"
Genesis,38,23,"Judah was like, 'Yeah, just let her have it so we don't look bad. I mean, I did try to give her this animal, but you couldn't find her. We don't want to be humiliated, right?'"
Genesis,38,24,"So, like, after about three months, someone came and told Judah, like, 'Yo, Tamar your daughter-in-law has been, like, doing some shady stuff, you know? She's pregnant and it's, like, not a good situation.' And Judah was all, 'Bring her out, man, we gotta, like, punish her, maybe burn her.'"
Genesis,38,25,"So, like, when she had this baby and all, she messaged her father-in-law and was all, 'Guess what, guess who made me preggo?' And she was like, 'Can you, like, figure out whose stuff these are? The fancy ring, the bracelets, and the cool staff.'"" }"
Genesis,38,26,"And Judah was like, yo, I gotta admit, she's way more righteous than me. 'Cause, like, I didn't give her to my son Shelah. And, btw, he never hooked up with her again."
Genesis,38,27,"So, like, when it was time for her to give birth and all, surprise! There were, like, twins in her belly."
Genesis,38,28,"So, when she was in labor, the baby reached out its hand, and the midwife quickly tied a red thread around its hand, saying, 'This baby is the first one to come out.'"
Genesis,38,29,"And then, like, as he pulled back his hand, his brother like, totally came out, and she was all like, 'Whoa, dude, how did you break out like that?' So they named him Pharez, which, like, means 'a breach' because, you know, he caused quite the commotion by breaking out like that."
Genesis,38,30,"And then his brother came out, and he had a dope scarlet thread on his hand. They called him Zarah.""}"
Genesis,39,1,"So, like, Joseph was taken to Egypt, ya know? And, get this, Potiphar, this big shot working for Pharaoh, who's like the boss, dude, and is in charge of the guards, he's an Egyptian, by the way, bought him from those Ishmeelites who brought Joseph down there. Crazy, right?"
Genesis,39,2,"God was vibing with Joseph, and he was straight-up successful. He was living it up in his master's crib, which happened to be in Egypt."
Genesis,39,3,"And his boss noticed that God was on his side, and that God made everything he did successful."
Genesis,39,4,"And Joseph was totally blessed in his boss's eyes, so he worked for him and his boss promoted him as the head honcho of his crib. He trusted Joseph with everything he owned."
Genesis,39,5,"So, like, when Joseph was put in charge of everything in Potiphar's house, the whole place started thriving, thanks to God's blessing. Seriously, everything Joseph was responsible for, both in the house and out in the fields, was just overflowing with God's favor."
Genesis,39,6,"So, like, this guy totally trusted Joseph with everything he had, and he didn't even have to worry about anything, except for the food he ate. Joseph was, you know, really good-looking and attractive."
Genesis,39,7,"After all this happened, his boss's wife started checking out Joseph and straight up said, 'Wanna hook up?'"
Genesis,39,8,"But he was like, no way, and he said to his master's wife, look, my master has no idea what's going on with me in the house, and he's entrusted me with everything he's got;"
Genesis,39,9,"Yo, I'm the top dog in this crib, and my boss has trusted me with everything except you, because you're his wifey. So why would I even consider doing this messed up stuff and going against God?"
Genesis,39,10,"One day, she kept on talking to Joseph, but he didn't give in to her or hang out with her."
Genesis,39,11,"So, like, at around that time, Joseph went into the house to handle his stuff, and, like, none of the guys who lived there were around."
Genesis,39,12,"Then she grabbed his clothes and said, 'Hook up with me!' But he made a quick exit, leaving his clothes behind."
Genesis,39,13,"So, like, she noticed that he, like, left his clothes with her and, you know, totally ran away,"
Genesis,39,14,"So, she gathered her squad and had a real talk with them, like, yo, check it - this guy brought in a Hebrew dude to clown us. He tried to get all up in my business, but I straight up screamed at the top of my lungs, you feel me? {loud: aka great}"
Genesis,39,15,"And then, when he heard me raising my voice and crying out, he quickly ditched his clothes with me and made a swift exit."
Genesis,39,16,And she kept his outfit with her until her boss came home.
Genesis,39,17,"So she told him, 'Hey, listen up. The Hebrew servant you brought here? Well, he came into my space and started making fun of me.'"
Genesis,39,18,"So, like, I was just expressing myself and calling out, and then he like totally bailed and left his clothes behind."
Genesis,39,19,"So, when his boss heard what his wife said, telling him that his servant did this to her, he got really mad."
Genesis,39,20,"So, Joseph's boss took him and threw him into prison, the spot where all the king's prisoners were held. And yup, he stayed there in the prison."
Genesis,39,21,"Yo, God had Joseph's back, and like, totally showed him love and kindness, and the prison guard was totally into him. It was lit, man."
Genesis,39,22,"The prison warden put Joseph in charge of all the other prisoners, and he was responsible for everything that happened there."
Genesis,39,23,"The prison guard didn't stress about anything within his control because God was on his side, and everything he did worked out well, thanks to God.""}"
Genesis,40,1,"So, like, after all that stuff happened, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt did something to make their boss, the king of Egypt, really mad."
Genesis,40,2,"And Pharaoh was super mad at two of his officers, the head bartender and the head baker."
Genesis,40,3,"So, like, he totally locked them up in the house of the top dog, you know, the captain of the guard. They were thrown into the slammer, the same spot where Joseph was stuck."
Genesis,40,4,"So, like, the head honcho in charge put Joseph in charge of them, and he helped them out. They all hung out together for a while in, like, lockdown."
Genesis,40,5,"So, like, they both had this dream one night, you know? And they each had their own dream and stuff. The butler and baker, they were chilling in the Egyptian king's prison and all."
Genesis,40,6,So Joseph walked up to them in the morning and saw that they were feeling down.
Genesis,40,7,"And he asked Pharaoh's squad that were chillin' with him in the crib of his boss's house, like, yo, why y'all lookin' all bummed out today? Why your faces lookin' mad negative?"
Genesis,40,8,"So they were like, 'Yo, we had this wild dream but there's nobody who can explain it to us.' And Joseph was like, 'Bro, don't interpretations come from God? Tell me what went down, if you could, please.'"" }"
Genesis,40,9,"So, like, the head butler spills his dreams to Joseph and he's all like, 'Dude, I had this dream where there was a huge vine right in front of me.'"" }"
Genesis,40,10,"So, like, there were these three branches in the vine, and they were all budding and blooming and stuff, and then these bunches of grapes popped up and they were totally ripe and ready to, like, eat and enjoy."
Genesis,40,11,"So, like, I had Pharaoh's cup in my hand, right? And I grabbed these grapes and squeezed them into the cup. Then, I handed the cup back to Pharaoh, just like that."
Genesis,40,12,"Joseph was like, 'Listen up, fam. Here's what that dream means: those three branches represent three days."
Genesis,40,13,"In just three days, Pharaoh is gonna recognize your skills and put you back in your position. You'll even be trusted with handing Pharaoh his cup, just like you used to do when you were his butler. {reckon: or, consider}"
Genesis,40,14,"But, like, when things are going great for you, do me a solid and remember me, show me some kindness, and, you know, put in a good word for me with Pharaoh. I'm just tryna get outta this place, ya feel me?"
Genesis,40,15,"So like, I was totally taken from the Hebrew land, and honestly, I didn't even do anything to deserve getting thrown into the dungeon here."
Genesis,40,16,"So, like, the head baker saw that Joseph's interpretation was legit and he was like, 'Yo, Joseph, I had this dream too, man. And get this, bro, I saw three totally rad white baskets on my head – and by white I mean, like, full of holes, you know?'"
Genesis,40,17,"So, like, the top basket had all kinds of yummy food for Pharaoh, and, you won't believe it, but the birds actually ate it right off my head. It was like their feast, you know?"
Genesis,40,18,"And Joseph was like, 'Yo, I got you with the 411 on this dream interpretation. So, check it: those three baskets represent three days, my dude.'"
Genesis,40,19,"In like, three days, Pharaoh is gonna be like, 'You're out, man!' and like, hang you on a tree for everyone to see. And then, birds are gonna come and feast on your flesh. Just saying."
Genesis,40,20,"So, like, on the third day, it was Pharaoh's birthday and he decided to throw this massive party for all his servants. During the party, he singled out the head butler and head baker from his crew."
Genesis,40,21,"And he totally hooked up the main butler, like, he got his butlership back and even let him hold Pharaoh's cup, no cap:"
Genesis,40,22,"But yo, Joseph was straight up right 'bout his interpretation and this resulted in the chief baker gettin' executed by hanging."
Genesis,40,23,"But, like, the head butler totally forgot about Joseph and, like, didn't remember him at all.""}"
Genesis,41,1,"So, after two whole years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream. And guess what? He was standing by the river."
Genesis,41,2,"So, like, these super good-looking and chubby cows came out of the river and started grazing in a meadow."
Genesis,41,3,"So, like, there were seven more cows that came out of the river, but these ones looked sick and skinny. And they, like, stood next to the other cows by the edge of the river."
Genesis,41,4,And the not-so-pretty and skinny cows totally devoured the seven good-looking and chubby cows. So Pharaoh woke up from his dream.
Genesis,41,5,"So, he dozed off again and had another dream: and, yo, check it - seven ears of corn popped up on one stalk, looking hella plump and dope. {rank: Hebrew for fat}"
Genesis,41,6,"Yo, check it out, seven weak ears dried up from the east wind grew right after them."
Genesis,41,7,"So, like, the seven scrawny ears totally chowed down on the seven plump and good-looking ears. And then Pharaoh woke up, and woah, he realized it was all just a dream."
Genesis,41,8,"So the next morning, he was feeling really anxious, and decided to gather all the magicians and wise people of Egypt. Pharaoh told them about his dream, but sadly, none of them could figure out what it meant for Pharaoh."
Genesis,41,9,"So the head butler talked to Pharaoh and was like, 'Yo, I just realized I messed up, my bad.'"" }"
Genesis,41,10,"Pharaoh got seriously mad at his dudes and locked me up in the captain of the guard's crib, me and the top baker dude:"
Genesis,41,11,"So like, dude, we were just chilling one night and both of us had these crazy dreams. And get this, each dream had its own unique meaning!"
Genesis,41,12,"So, there was this dope young dude with us, a Hebrew homie who worked as a servant for the captain of the guard. We spilled our dreams to him, and he straight up decoded them for each of us based on what we dreamt about."
Genesis,41,13,"So, like, what happened was, the guy totally explained exactly what it meant, and it turned out to be true, dude. He brought me back to my important job, and, you know, unfortunately, he ended up giving the other guy the boot."
Genesis,41,14,"So Pharaoh hit up Joseph and they pulled him out of jail real quick. He freshened up, got a fresh cut, switched up his outfit, and went to meet Pharaoh."
Genesis,41,15,"So Pharaoh was like, 'Yo Joseph, I had this crazy dream but nobody can make sense of it. But I heard you have mad skills in interpreting dreams. Like, you got that gift, ya know? So if you hear a dream, you can totally break it down.'"
Genesis,41,16,"Joseph replied to Pharaoh, like, it's not really up to me, you know? God's got this and He'll totally give you a chill and peaceful answer, man."
Genesis,41,17,"So Pharaoh was like, 'Yo Joseph, check it, I had this dream where I was chillin' by the river bank:'"
Genesis,41,18,"Yo, check it out, there were these seven cows that came out of the river, and dang, they were thicc and lookin' fly. They went to eat in a lush field."
Genesis,41,19,"And, like, woah, seven more cows showed up, man, and they were like, totally skinny and ugly and sickly-looking, like I've never seen anything so messed up in Egypt, dude."
Genesis,41,20,"So, like, the skinny and ugly cows totally chowed down on the first seven plump cows:"
Genesis,41,21,"And after they devoured, it was like, impossible to tell that they had actually eaten them; but they still looked totally uncool, just like before. Then I woke up, man."
Genesis,41,22,"So, in my dream, I saw something pretty crazy – like, imagine this: there was this stalk, right? And hanging from it were these seven ears that were, like, perfect and totally awesome!"
Genesis,41,23,"Yo, peep this: seven ears popped up, but they were all withered, thin, and straight up wrecked by the east wind. Like, they were smaller and shriveled, you know?"
Genesis,41,24,"Then the skinny ears ate the seven good ears, and I explained this to the magicians, but no one could tell me what it meant."
Genesis,41,25,"So Joseph told Pharaoh, both of Pharaoh's dreams mean the same thing: God revealed to Pharaoh what's gonna happen soon."
Genesis,41,26,"So like, the seven healthy cows represent seven years, and the seven good ears of corn also represent seven years. It's like, the dream is all about the same thing, you know?"
Genesis,41,27,"So, like, those seven skinny and unattractive cows that appeared after the other ones, they represent seven years, you know? And those seven dried-up ears of corn messed up by the east wind, they're like a sign of seven years of major famine."
Genesis,41,28,"So, this is what I've told Pharaoh: God is gonna make it crystal clear to him about what He's gonna do."
Genesis,41,29,"Yo, check it out! So, like, for the next seven years, Egypt's gonna totally be lit with plenty of everything all over the place, ya know?"
Genesis,41,30,"And then, like, after that, there's gonna be seven years of straight-up famine, fam. Like, everyone's gonna forget about all the abundance and goodness in Egypt, 'cause this famine is gonna straight-up devour the whole land."
Genesis,41,31,"And there won't be any abundance in the land because of that intense famine; it's gonna be truly tough. Like, super heavy and serious."
Genesis,41,32,And the reason the dream came to Pharaoh twice is because God is totally behind it and He's gonna make it happen real soon. God's got it all planned out!
Genesis,41,33,"So like, Pharaoh needs to find someone who's really smart and clever, and put them in charge of Egypt, you know?"
Genesis,41,34,"Yo, Pharaoh should totally get on this move and like, hire some managers to take charge of the land. And during the seven years of plenty, he should like, claim a fifth of Egypt's land for real."
Genesis,41,35,"Yo, make sure to stock up on all the grub during the years when everything is going great. Store up that corn for Pharaoh and stash away food in the cities."
Genesis,41,36,"And that food will be saved for the land during the seven years of famine that will happen in Egypt, so that the land doesn't get messed up by the famine. (Mess up...: Hebrew, not get cut off)"
Genesis,41,37,Pharaoh and all his homies were totally vibin' with it.
Genesis,41,38,"And Pharaoh was like, guys, you gotta admit, this dude is something special. I mean, where else can we find someone with such incredible skills and, like, a true connection to the divine?"
Genesis,41,39,"Pharaoh was like, 'Yo Joseph, God has totally given you all this insight and you are straight up the most clever and wise person we've got around here:'"
Genesis,41,40,"You're gonna be the boss of my crib, and all my peeps will do as you say, no doubt. Only when it comes to the throne, I'll have a higher rank than you. {be ruled: which means have authority, or show respect}"" }"
Genesis,41,41,"So Pharaoh's like, yo Joseph, check it, I've made you the big boss of all Egypt."
Genesis,41,42,"So Pharaoh, like, removed his own ring from his hand and totally placed it on Joseph's hand, and dressed him up in really sleek and stylish clothes made of fine linen. He even put a cool gold chain around Joseph's neck; it was like, super fancy, you know? (Fine linen can also mean silk, just FYI)."
Genesis,41,43,"Then he let him ride in the swaggy second chariot he had, and everyone was like, 'Yo, show respect and bow down!' And he made him the ultimate boss of all Egypt. 'Respect, Father' was his new name, ya feel?"
Genesis,41,44,"Pharaoh was like, hey Joseph, just so you know, I'm Pharaoh, and nobody in Egypt can do anything without you. Like, no one can even lift a finger or take a step without your say-so."
Genesis,41,45,"Pharaoh was like, 'Yo, Joseph, your new name is Zaphnathpaaneah,' and he hooked him up with Asenath, who was the daughter of Potipherah, the priest of On. Then Joseph became the real deal and had authority all over Egypt. Fun fact: Zaphnathpaaneah means 'A revealer of secrets' or 'The man to whom secrets are revealed' in Coptic."
Genesis,41,46,"So, Joseph was like, thirty years old when he straight-up stood in front of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. And then Joseph left Pharaoh's presence and went all over Egypt, checking things out."
Genesis,41,47,"During the seven years of plenty, the earth was totally slaying the game with its abundance of crops."
Genesis,41,48,"And he like, collected all the grub, like the total eats of the seven years, that were in Egypt, and stashed it in the cities. He made sure to store the crops from all the fields surrounding each city in the same way."
Genesis,41,49,"Joseph snagged an insane amount of corn, like more than you could ever fathom, until he straight up lost count; like seriously, it was endless!"
Genesis,41,50,"Before the famine went down, Joseph had two sons. Asenath, the daughter of Potipherah who was a priest in the city of On, gave birth to them."
Genesis,41,51,"And Joseph gave his firstborn son the name Manasseh, because he believed that God has helped him move past all the struggles and troubles he faced, as well as the burden of his family's past. Manasseh means 'Forgetting'."
Genesis,41,52,"And the second one, he named Ephraim. Why? Because God blessed me with prosperity even during the hard times in this place that has brought me suffering. Ephraimm means 'Fruitful', if you were wondering.)"
Genesis,41,53,And the amazing abundance that happened in Egypt for seven years finally came to an end.
Genesis,41,54,"And yeah, the seven years of like, severe shortage began to happen, just like Joseph predicted. And this shortage was happening everywhere, like all over the world. But in Egypt specifically, they had bread and were not affected."
Genesis,41,55,"So, like, when Egypt was totally out of food, everyone was freaking out and begging Pharaoh for bread. And Pharaoh was all like, 'Yo, just go to Joseph and do whatever he tells you to do, alright?'"
Genesis,41,56,"So, like there was a really big famine going on everywhere, even in Egypt. And guess what? Joseph was like, 'Yo, let's open up all the storehouses and start selling food to the Egyptians.' But dang, the famine got even worse in Egypt."
Genesis,41,57,"So, like, all these countries were totally coming to Egypt, you know, to get some of that grain from Joseph. The famine was hitting hard, man, like, every single land was experiencing it.""}"
Genesis,42,1,"So like, when Jacob peeped that there was mad corn in Egypt, he was all like, 'Yo sons, why you just standing there starin' at each other?'"
Genesis,42,2,"And he was like, yo, I've heard there's mad corn in Egypt. So, you should totally head down there and buy some for us, you know? That way, we won't starve and die."
Genesis,42,3,"So, like, Joseph's ten brothers headed down to Egypt to cop some corn."
Genesis,42,4,"But Jacob didn't let Benjamin, Joseph's brother, go with his other brothers because he was worried that something bad might happen to him."
Genesis,42,5,"So, like, the Israelites went to get some grain from the peeps who already had some, ‘cause there was, like, a major famine going on in Canaan."
Genesis,42,6,"So, like, Joseph was totally in charge of the whole land, and he was the one selling stuff to everyone. And then his brothers showed up and like, totally bowed down to him, putting their faces on the ground and all."
Genesis,42,7,"So Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he acted like he didn't know them and spoke sternly to them. He asked them, 'Where did you come from?' And they replied, 'We came from Canaan to buy food.'"
Genesis,42,8,"And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they didn't recognize him."
Genesis,42,9,"So, Joseph totally remembered those dreams he had about them and straight up said, you guys are like spies or something, checking out the land in secret!"
Genesis,42,10,"They were like, 'Nah, bro. We're here just to get some grub, not cause trouble, my dude.'"" }"
Genesis,42,11,"We're all just some dudes, bro. Like, seriously, we ain't lying or anything, we're your faithful homies, not undercover agents or anything."
Genesis,42,12,"And he was like, no way, bro, you guys came just to scope out the land's beautiful view."
Genesis,42,13,"So, like, there's twelve of us, bros, and we're all sons of this one dude from Canaan. And, check it, the youngest dude is hanging out with our pops today, but one of us ain't here, man."
Genesis,42,14,"Joseph was like, yo listen up, remember when I told you that you guys were spies? Well, that's what I was talking about."
Genesis,42,15,"Alright, here's the deal: You ain't leaving here unless your little bro rolls through, I swear on Pharaoh's life."
Genesis,42,16,"Yo, send one of y'all to go get your brother. Meanwhile, the rest of y'all gonna be locked up so we can see if you're tellin' the truth or if y'all some spies. Swear on Pharaoh's life!"
Genesis,42,17,And he gathered all of them and kept them confined for three days.
Genesis,42,18,"And Joseph was like, yo listen up on the third day. If you wanna keep living, you gotta do this thing, coz I respect and fear God, you know?"
Genesis,42,19,"If you guys are really real ones, then have one of your squad be locked up in your crib while the rest of y'all go and grab some food for the famines in your houses:"
Genesis,42,20,"But like, bring your youngest bro to me, and then you'll totally prove what you're saying, and you won't get in trouble. And they actually did it, no joke."
Genesis,42,21,"So, like, they were talking to each other and being super honest, saying that they totally messed up when it came to their brother. They saw how much pain he was going through, pleading with them, but they totally ignored him. And now, they're facing all this trouble because of it."
Genesis,42,22,"And Reuben was like, 'Didn't I tell you not to do anything bad to the kid? But you didn't listen! Now, his blood is on your hands.'"" }"
Genesis,42,23,"And they didn't realize that Joseph could understand them, because he was speaking to them through an interpreter. (The interpreter was the one translating their words for Joseph.)"
Genesis,42,24,"Then he turned away from them and couldn't help but cry. After a moment, he went back to them and started talking with them. He decided to take Simeon from among them and tied him up right before their eyes."
Genesis,42,25,"So Joseph was like, 'Yo, fill up their bags with corn and put their money back in their bags, and give them some food for their journey.' And that's exactly what he did to them."
Genesis,42,26,"And they loaded their donkeys with the corn, and left from there."
Genesis,42,27,"And when one of them opened his backpack to give his donkey some food at the hotel, he noticed his money; because, you know, it was right there in his backpack."
Genesis,42,28,"And he was like, guys, my money is back in my bag! They were shook and scared, asking each other, yo, what did God just do to us?"
Genesis,42,29,"So they went to their dad Jacob in Canaan and told him everything that happened to them. They were like,"
Genesis,42,30,"Yo, this dude, who's like the boss of the whole land, straight up came at us with some harsh words and accused us of being spies from another country. Like, he didn't hold back at all..."
Genesis,42,31,"And we were like, 'Yo, bro, we ain't no spies or anything, but we're just straight-up honest dudes, you feel me?'"
Genesis,42,32,"So there's like twelve of us, bros, all from the same pops. But one of us isn't here and the youngest one, he's chilling with our pops back home in Canaan."
Genesis,42,33,"And the guy in charge told us, 'Look, this is how I'm gonna know if you guys are legit. Leave one of your bros here with me and take some food for your fam back home, then you can bounce and deal with the famine.'"
Genesis,42,34,"And like, bring your little brother to me, then I'll know you're not like undercover agents or whatever, but legit dudes. And then I'll totally give your brother back to you, and you can do your thing in this land."
Genesis,42,35,"And when they emptied their bags, they found that every guy's cash stash was still in their bag. When they and their dad saw the money, they got freaked out."
Genesis,42,36,"Then their dad, Jacob, said to them, 'You've taken away my children! Joseph is gone, Simeon is gone, and now you want to take Benjamin away too? It feels like everything is going against me.'"" }"
Genesis,42,37,"Reuben went to his old man and said, 'Yo, Dad, if I don't bring him back to you, go ahead and end my two bros. Trust me, hand him over to me, and I'll make sure he returns to you.'""}"
Genesis,42,38,"And he was like, 'Nah, my son can't roll with you guys. His brother died, so he's all alone now. If anything bad happens to him while you're out there, it's gonna crush me and bring me to utter despair.'"" }"
Genesis,43,1,"And there was, like, a super intense famine in the whole place."
Genesis,43,2,"So, like, when they finished eating all the corn they got from Egypt, their dad was like, 'Hey, go back and get us some more food, okay? Just a little bit.'"
Genesis,43,3,"So Judah was like, dude, this guy straight up told us, 'I ain't gonna show my face unless your bro's with you.' He was serious, man."
Genesis,43,4,"Yo, if you let us bring our bro along, we're down to go and cop some food for you:"
Genesis,43,5,"But, like, if you don't send {him}, we're totally not coming: 'cause the dude straight up told us we won't get to see his face unless your bro is with you, ya know?"
Genesis,43,6,"Israel was like, yo, why you gotta do me dirty by telling the man about my brother?"
Genesis,43,7,"So, like, this guy asked us some intense questions about our fam, you know? He was all like, 'Is your dad still around? Do you have another bro?' And we answered him exactly how he asked, ya know? But like, how could we have known that he would be all, 'Bring your bro with you'? Like, major plot twist!"
Genesis,43,8,"So Judah was like, 'Hey Dad, let the boy come with us. We gotta bounce and survive, so that all of us, including you and the little ones, can stay alive.'"
Genesis,43,9,"I got his back, you can count on me. If I don't bring him back to you, I'll take the blame forever."
Genesis,43,10,"If we hadn't stayed for so long, we would have definitely come back again by now. Like, this would be the second time. Or wait, actually, it's like the second time because of this."
Genesis,43,11,"Yo, listen up, my peeps! Israel, their dad, was like, 'Alright, if that's how it's gotta be, then here's the plan: Y'all grab the finest fruits we got, pack 'em up in your bags, and take 'em down to that man. Alongside, bring him a little gift, like a small jar of balm, some honey, spices, myrrh, and also some nuts and almonds.'"
Genesis,43,12,And make sure to bring twice the amount of money with you; and don't forget to take that money which was returned in the mouths of your sacks; maybe it was just a mistake:
Genesis,43,13,"Yo, grab your bro and get up. Let's go meet that dude again."
Genesis,43,14,"And may God have mercy on you in the eyes of the man, so that he will let your other brother and Benjamin go. If I lose my children, then so be it."
Genesis,43,15,"So the guys grabbed the gift and also took double the cash in their hands, along with Benjamin. They got up, headed down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph."
Genesis,43,16,"And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, 'Yo, bring these guys back to my crib and get them some food ready, because they're dining with me at noon. You know, like, prepare something tasty for them!'"
Genesis,43,17,"So the guy did what Joseph told him to do, and he brought the dudes to Joseph's crib."
Genesis,43,18,"The guys were totally shook when they were brought into Joseph's crib. They were like, 'Yo, we got set up! Remember that cash that ended up back in our bags last time? Now he's gonna use that as an excuse to accuse us, come after us, and make us his slaves, along with our donkeys. 🙆‍♂️💸'}"
Genesis,43,19,"Then they went up to the manager of Joseph's crib, and had a chat with him by the entrance to the crib."
Genesis,43,20,"And we were like, yo, we came all the way down here just to grab some grub, you know what I'm saying? We were starving and in need of some food, man."
Genesis,43,21,"So, like, when we got to the inn, we opened our luggage and, surprise, everyone's money was still in their bags, all accounted for and stuff. We brought it all back with us, no missing money or anything."
Genesis,43,22,"And like, we totally brought down some extra cash in our hands to buy some grub, but honestly, we have no clue who slipped the money into our bags, it's a total mystery!"
Genesis,43,23,"And he was like, 'Yo guys, chillax! Don't be scared! Your God, and the God of your pops, just blessed you with some sick loot in your bags. By the way, I accidentally took your cash, but no biggie. Oh, and he let Simeon join y'all. Lit! (BTW, that 'your money came to me' part, yeah it means I accidentally took your moolah.)"
Genesis,43,24,"So the guy took the dudes to Joseph's crib, hooked them up with some water to freshen up and washed their feet. And he also provided food for their donkeys."
Genesis,43,25,"And they prepared the gift for when Joseph arrived at noon, because they heard that they would have lunch together."
Genesis,43,26,"So, like, when Joseph got back home, they brought him this gift that they had in their hand, and then they totally bowed down before him, like, right to the ground."
Genesis,43,27,"And he was like, 'Hey, how's it going, you guys? Is your dad doing okay? You know, the old man you were talking about? Is he still alive and doing well?'"
Genesis,43,28,"And they were like, 'Yo, our dad is actually doing really well, still kickin' it. So they lowered their heads and showed some respect."
Genesis,43,29,"Then he looked up and saw his bro Benjamin, his mom's kid, and asked, 'Yo, is this your lil bro you were telling me about?' And he replied, 'May God bless you, bro.'"
Genesis,43,30,"And Joseph rushed, because he felt deep compassion for his brother. He looked for a place where he could cry, so he went into his room and sobbed there."
Genesis,43,31,"Then he quickly freshened up his face, headed out, controlled his emotions, and requested some food."
Genesis,43,32,"And they made separate meals for him, the Israelites, and the Egyptians who dined with him because it was considered wrong for Egyptians to eat bread with the Hebrews; it was something they found unacceptable."
Genesis,43,33,"And they all took their seats in front of him, with the oldest ones sitting first based on their birthright, and the youngest ones sitting according to their age. And everyone was amazed by each other's presence."
Genesis,43,34,"And he sent them some seriously good food from his own table: but Benjamin got five times more than anyone else. And they ate and had a lit time together.""}"
Genesis,44,1,"Then he told his house manager, 'Yo, go fill their bags with grub, like as much as they can handle, and put each dude's dough back in their bags. Be discreet about it, tho. Ya feel me?'"
Genesis,44,2,"And like, Joseph was all, 'Yo, put my fancy silver cup in the youngest bro's sack, you know. And also, throw his cash for the food in there too.' So, the dude did exactly what Joseph said, no cap."
Genesis,44,3,"When it started getting bright in the morning, they let the guys and their donkeys go."
Genesis,44,4,"So, like, after they left the city but weren't really far away, Joseph told his assistant, 'Dude, go catch up to those guys. And when you catch up to them, ask them why they're treating us with evil after we've been good to them?'"
Genesis,44,5,"Umm, bro, isn't this the same cup that my lord, like, sips from and uses to, you know, get insights? By doing this, you guys have totally messed up and done something wrong, for real. (Or you could say, 'By doing this, you guys have straight up made a bad move.')"" }"
Genesis,44,6,"And he caught up to them and he started talking to them, saying the exact same stuff."
Genesis,44,7,"And they were like, why is our dude saying that? No way, we can't go along with this:"
Genesis,44,8,"Yo, check it! We totally brought back that cash we found in our bags, all the way from Canaan. So why would we even think of jacking your lord's silver or gold from his crib?"
Genesis,44,9,"If any of your servants are found to have done this, they should face serious consequences, and we will willingly serve and obey you, my lord."
Genesis,44,10,"And he was like, okay, I'll do what you say. The person who has it will be my servant, and you all will be innocent."
Genesis,44,11,"So, like, they all quickly brought down their sacks to the ground and opened them up, you know?"
Genesis,44,12,"So he looked through all of their bags, starting with the oldest and ending with the youngest. And guess what? The cup was discovered in Benjamin's bag!"
Genesis,44,13,"So they're like, totally in shock, tearing their clothes and loading their ride, and all head back to the city."
Genesis,44,14,"So Judah and his squad pulled up to Joseph's crib, 'cause he was still chillin' there. And they all showed mad respect by bowing down before him like on the low."
Genesis,44,15,"And Joseph was like, yo, what's the deal with what you guys did? Don't you know that I can totally figure things out like a boss? Like, seriously, did you even think about that?"
Genesis,44,16,"And Judah was like, 'Yo, what's good, my lord? What should we even say? How can we defend ourselves? God's totally exposed our wrongdoings. Check it, we're here as your servants, both us and the dude who has the cup.'"
Genesis,44,17,"And he was like, nah fam, I ain't gonna do that. But the person who has the cup, they gonna be my servant. And as for y'all, you can peace out and go back to your pops without any worries."
Genesis,44,18,"So, Judah went up to him and was like, 'Hey, dude, can I like, whisper something in your ear without you getting all ticked off? 'Cause you're totally in charge, just like Pharaoh.'"
Genesis,44,19,"So, the bossman asked his crew, like, yo, ya'll got a pops or a bro?"
Genesis,44,20,"So, like, we told my dude, 'Yo, our dad is, like, super old and we have this little sibling who was born when our dad was, like, way past his prime, ya know? And it sucks, man, 'cause our other bro died and now he's the only one left from our mom, and our dad totally adores him."
Genesis,44,21,"And you told your crew, bring him over to me, so I can check him out with my own eyes."
Genesis,44,22,"And we were like, yo bro, the homie can't bounce without his old man. 'Cause if he leaves, his old man would straight up kick the bucket."
Genesis,44,23,"And you told your crew, unless your little bro joins the squad, you won't see me again."
Genesis,44,24,"And when we finally reached my father's place, we shared with him the message from my boss."
Genesis,44,25,"So our dad's like, yo, go get us some munchies, man."
Genesis,44,26,"And we were like, bro, we can't go down there without our youngest brother, you know? No way! We can't even see the dude's face unless our youngest brother is with us, man."
Genesis,44,27,"So, my dad, being all cool and chill, was like, 'Yo, my peeps, y'all know that my wifey gave birth to two dope sons, right?'"" }"
Genesis,44,28,"Then they left my side, and I thought for sure they were completely lost. But from that moment on, I never laid eyes on them again."
Genesis,44,29,"And if you also snatch this away from me, and something bad happens to him, you'll make me really sad and sorrowful till the end of my days."
Genesis,44,30,"So, like, when I go back to my dad and the kid ain't with us, and, like, his whole life depends on the kid's life;"
Genesis,44,31,"So basically, if dad sees that the boy ain't with us, he's gonna die. And us, the servants, we're gonna make dad so sad that he'll go all gray and down to the grave."
Genesis,44,32,"So, like, I promised my dad that I'd take responsibility for the kid, ya know? I told him, 'If I don't bring him back to you, then I'll forever be held accountable by you, pops.'"
Genesis,44,33,"So like, listen, can you do me a solid favor? Can I be the one to take this guy's place and serve you like a loyal servant, and let this guy go hang with his bros?"
Genesis,44,34,"Like, how am I supposed to face my dad if the homie ain't with me? I don't wanna witness the bad stuff that can happen to my old man.""}"
Genesis,45,1,"So, Joseph couldn't hold it in anymore in front of everyone watching, and he shouted, 'I need everyone to leave right now!' And there was no one left with him when Joseph finally revealed his true identity to his brothers."
Genesis,45,2,"And he straight up started bawling his eyes out and everyone in Egypt, including Pharaoh and his posse, could hear him. {wept...: Hebrew translation: straight up wailed with tears streaming down his face}""}"
Genesis,45,3,"So Joseph goes up to his brothers and says, 'Yo, it's me, Joseph! Is my dad still alive?' But his brothers were shook and couldn't even respond because they were freaking out over seeing him there."
Genesis,45,4,"So, like, Joseph saw his brothers and was all like, 'Yo, come here, please.' And they, like, went near him. And he was like, 'Dudes, it's me, Joseph, your bro! Remember how you sold me out and sent me to Egypt? Yeah, that's me.'"" }"
Genesis,45,5,"So like, don't be all sad and mad at yourselves for selling me out here, 'cause God totally sent me ahead of you to like, save lives and stuff. And seriously, don't be angry, like, in your eyes or anything."
Genesis,45,6,"So, like, for the past two years, there has been this major famine going on, and get this, it's gonna last for another five years! Can you believe it? Like, during these five years, there won't be any planting or harvesting happening at all. It's gonna be pretty tough, man."
Genesis,45,7,"God totally sent me ahead of you to make sure you guys have future generations and to save your lives through a major rescue mission. Like, He wanted to keep a small group of you safe and stuff, you know?"
Genesis,45,8,"Okay, listen up fam, it wasn't you who sent me here, but God himself. He's the one who made me the big boss in Pharaoh's crib and in charge of everything in Egypt."
Genesis,45,9,"Hey, hurry up and go to my dad. Tell him, like, I'm Joseph and God has made me the ruler of all Egypt. He needs to come down to me ASAP, no time to waste."
Genesis,45,10,"So, like, you're gonna live in this rad place called Goshen, and it's gonna be super close to me. Like, you, your kids, your grandkids, all your animals, and everything you own will totally be there too. No worries!"
Genesis,45,11,"And I will take care of you there, because there are still five years of famine ahead. I don't want you, your family, or anything you own to suffer from poverty."
Genesis,45,12,"Yo, check it out! You and my bro Benjamin can see with your own eyes that it's me, your boy, who's speaking to you right now."
Genesis,45,13,"Yo, make sure you fill my dad in on all the sick stuff that's been happening here in Egypt, and everything you've witnessed. And yo, don't waste any time. Hurry up and bring my dad down here already."
Genesis,45,14,"And he hugged his brother Benjamin so tight, and they both started crying on each other's shoulders."
Genesis,45,15,"Then he gave all his bros a heartfelt hug, shedding some tears of joy for them. And right after that, they all had a good convo together."
Genesis,45,16,"News got out that Joseph's brothers had arrived at Pharaoh's house, and Pharaoh and his crew were stoked about it."
Genesis,45,17,"Pharaoh was like, 'Yo, Joseph, tell your bros to load up their animals and hit the road to Canaan.'"
Genesis,45,18,"Yo, gather up your pops and your whole crew and roll up to my crib. I got you covered with all the good stuff in Egypt, and we gonna feast like kings."
Genesis,45,19,"Yo, here's the deal: you gotta do what you've been told. Grab some wheels from Egypt for your kids and wives, bring your old man and come on over."
Genesis,45,20,"Don't just focus on your things, because the prosperity of all Egypt belongs to you. Don't hold back or hesitate in sharing the wealth."
Genesis,45,21,"So the Israelites did as Joseph told them, and he supplied them with wagons, just as Pharaoh had ordered. He also gave them plenty of food for the journey."
Genesis,45,22,"He gave each person some cool new clothes, but Benjamin got three hundred bucks and five outfit changes!"
Genesis,45,23,"And he sent his father a DM like this: ten totally stacked donkeys loaded with the yummiest Egyptian stuff, and ten chill donkeys loaded with corn, bread, and meat for his dad on the journey. #donkeygoals"
Genesis,45,24,"And then he told his bros to bounce, and they dipped. He was like, yo, make sure y'all don't start beefin' on the way."
Genesis,45,25,"So they left Egypt and arrived in the land of Canaan, where their father Jacob was."
Genesis,45,26,"So they went and told him, like, Yo dude, Joseph's still kickin' and he's like the boss man, running the whole show in Egypt. And Jacob was like, whoa man, I can't even handle this, he couldn't believe what he was hearing."
Genesis,45,27,"So they filled him in on everything Joseph had said to them. And when Jacob saw the cool rides Joseph had sent to pick him up, he felt a surge of hope and joy."
Genesis,45,28,"Israel was like, alright, I've had my fill. My son Joseph is still kickin', so I'm gonna pay him a visit before I kick the bucket.""}"
Genesis,46,1,"So Israel packed up all his stuff and headed to Beersheba. When he got there, he made some offerings to the same God his dad, Isaac, worshipped."
Genesis,46,2,"So, like, God came through to Israel in, like, a super intense dream and was all like, 'Jacob, Jacob.' And Jacob was like, 'Yo, I'm right here.'"" }"
Genesis,46,3,"And God said, yo, I'm like, God, the same God that your dad worships. Don't trip about going to Egypt, 'cause I'm gonna hook you up and make your descendants a super dope nation."
Genesis,46,4,"I got your back, fam. I'll roll with you to Egypt and for sure bring you back. Joseph gonna be there to close your eyes when it's time."
Genesis,46,5,"So Jacob left Beersheba, and his sons, along with their kids and wives, helped him move using the wagons that Pharaoh sent for the journey."
Genesis,46,6,"So, they brought their livestock and all the stuff they acquired in Canaan and went to Egypt. Jacob and all his fam rolled up too. Like, they were together and all."
Genesis,46,7,"He brought all of his kids, grandkids, daughters, and granddaughters, along with all his descendants, to Egypt with him."
Genesis,46,8,"So, like, these are the names of the homies from Israel who went to Egypt: Jacob and his crew -- Reuben, who's the firstborn of Jacob."
Genesis,46,9,"And Reuben had these sons: Hanoch, Phallu, Hezron, and Carmi."
Genesis,46,10,"So the Simeon dudes were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, who had a Canaanite mom. (Jemuel could also be called Nemuel. Jachin could also be called Jarib. Zohar could also be called Zerah.)"
Genesis,46,11,"So, like, Levi had three sons, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Oh, and just a heads up, Gershon is sometimes called Gershom."
Genesis,46,12,"Now Judah had five sons: Er, Onan, Shelah, Pharez, and Zerah. Unfortunately, Er and Onan passed away while they were in Canaan. Pharez, on the other hand, had two sons named Hezron and Hamul."
Genesis,46,13,"The bros of Issachar were Tola, Phuvah, Job, and Shimron. {Phuvah and Job: also known as Puah and Jashub}"
Genesis,46,14,"Soooo, check out the fam of Zebulun, they got Sered, Elon, and Jahleel, holding it down!"
Genesis,46,15,"These are the kids of Leah, the ones she had with Jacob when they were in Padanaram, and their sister Dinah was included too. In total, there were thirty-three children, counting both sons and daughters."
Genesis,46,16,"The dudes from the tribe of Gad were Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli. (Ziphion can also be called Zephon, and Ezbon can also be called Ozni, and Arodi can also be called Arod.)"
Genesis,46,17,"Asher had some cool kids named Jimnah, Ishuah, Isui, and Beriah. They also had a rad sister named Serah. Beriah's sons were Heber and Malchiel."
Genesis,46,18,"These are the kids of Zilpah that Laban hooked up with Leah, and she had them with Jacob. There were a total of sixteen of them."
Genesis,46,19,"Rachel's sons were Joseph and Benjamin, they were Jacob's wife."
Genesis,46,20,"In Egypt, Joseph had two sons named Manasseh and Ephraim. Their mother was Asenath, the daughter of Potipherah, who was a priest or leader in the city of On."
Genesis,46,21,"The dudes from Benjamin were Belah, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard. BTW, Ehi might also go by Ahiram, Muppim could be Shupham or Shuppim, and Huppim could be Hupham."
Genesis,46,22,Here are the kids Rachel had with Jacob: there were a total of fourteen.
Genesis,46,23,"And Dan had a few kids, Hushim was one of them. {Hushim: or, Shuham}"
Genesis,46,24,"These are the peeps from the tribe of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. Y'all got some cool names, fam!"
Genesis,46,25,"Here's a rundown of Bilhah's kids that Laban hooked Rachel up with. She gave birth to them for Jacob, and they made a total of seven peeps in the fam."
Genesis,46,26,"So, when Jacob and his crew made the move to Egypt, there were a total of 66 peeps (excluding Jacob's sons' wives) who joined the gang. Just a little FYI, the term 'loins' actually refers to Jacob's thigh in the Hebrew language. No cap!"
Genesis,46,27,And Joseph had two sons while he was in Egypt. The total number of people from Jacob's family who came to Egypt was seventy.
Genesis,46,28,"Then he asked Judah to go ahead of him to Joseph, to lead him to Goshen. And they arrived in the land of Goshen."
Genesis,46,29,"So Joseph got his ride ready and went to meet his dad, Israel, in Goshen. When they finally saw each other, Joseph hugged his dad real tight and they both cried for a good while."
Genesis,46,30,"Israel said to Joseph, I am ready to pass away now that I have seen your face, knowing that you are still alive."
Genesis,46,31,"So Joseph was like, 'Hey bros and fam, I'm gonna head up and tell Pharaoh that our peeps from Canaan are here with me.'"
Genesis,46,32,"The dudes are like shepherds, cuz that's their gig - taking care of animals and stuff. They've brought all their flocks, herds, and everything they own with them. It's what they do for a living, ya know?"
Genesis,46,33,"And it's gonna happen, when Pharaoh hits you up and goes, 'Yo, what's your hustle?'"
Genesis,46,34,"So basically, we've been dealing with livestock since we were young, and our parents too. It's the way we've always made a living. This is why we can settle down in Goshen. You see, the Egyptians aren't really into the whole shepherd thing, they find it repulsive.""}"
Genesis,47,1,"So Joseph went and told Pharaoh, like, 'Yo, my dad and my bros, along with their animals and stuff, have come out of Canaan and now they're chilling in Goshen.'"" }"
Genesis,47,2,So he grabbed five of his friends and introduced them to Pharaoh.
Genesis,47,3,"Pharaoh was like, 'Yo, what do you guys do for a living?' And they were like, 'We're sheep herders, just like our ancestors, bro.'"" }"
Genesis,47,4,"So we told Pharaoh that we came here to stay for a while because there's no good grazing land for our animals in Canaan. The famine is really bad over there. So, could you please let us live in the land of Goshen?"
Genesis,47,5,"So Pharaoh talked to Joseph and said, 'Hey, your dad and your bros are here with you now!'"
Genesis,47,6,"Hey, Egypt is all yours! Settle your dad and bros in the nicest part of the land, specifically in Goshen. And if you come across some skilled dudes, put them in charge of my cattle."
Genesis,47,7,So Joseph brought his dad Jacob and presented him to Pharaoh. And Jacob gave Pharaoh his blessings.
Genesis,47,8,"Pharaoh was like, yo Jacob, how many years you been clockin'? Like, how many years have you lived on this earth?"
Genesis,47,9,"Yo, Pharaoh, just so you know, I've been on this journey called life for a hundred and thirty years. But man, these years have been rough and short compared to the long and blessed lives of my ancestors during their time on Earth."
Genesis,47,10,So Jacob gave his blessings to Pharaoh and then left his presence.
Genesis,47,11,"So Joseph found a rad spot in Egypt for his dad and bros in the land of Rameses, just like Pharaoh told him to. They got their own little piece of land, the prime real estate in Egypt."
Genesis,47,12,"So Joseph made sure his dad, his brothers, and all their family had enough bread to eat, taking into account each family's needs, just like when you take care of a little child."
Genesis,47,13,"So, like, there was legit zero bread anywhere in the whole land. It was a major famine, you know? Even Egypt and Canaan were totally wiped out because of it."
Genesis,47,14,"So, like, Joseph collected all the cash he found in Egypt and Canaan from selling the corn, and then he brought it back to Pharaoh's crib."
Genesis,47,15,"So like, when there was no more money in Egypt and Canaan, all the Egyptians went to Joseph and asked him for bread. They were like, 'Dude, why should we die while you're here? We're broke AF.'"" }"
Genesis,47,16,"Yo, Joseph was like, 'Yo, hook me up with your livestock and I'll trade you some cash since money's running low.'"" }"
Genesis,47,17,"So, they brought their cows to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in return for horses, flocks, herds, and donkeys. He provided them with enough bread to feed all their animals for that entire year."
Genesis,47,18,"After that first year, they approached him again in the second year and were like, 'Listen up, dude! We ain't gonna hide it from you. We're totally broke! You've got all our cash and livestock. We've got nothing left except ourselves and our land.'"
Genesis,47,19,"Why should we suffer and watch ourselves and our land die? Can you supply us with food and buy our land, so that we and our land can serve Pharaoh? And please give us seeds, so that we can survive and prevent the land from becoming desolate."
Genesis,47,20,"So, like, Joseph straight up bought all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh! See, the Egyptians were selling their fields and stuff, 'cause this crazy famine was wrecking them. And guess what? Boom! The land ended up belonging to Pharaoh. It was wild!"
Genesis,47,21,"And so, like, he basically relocated all the peeps, moving 'em to different cities from one side of Egypt to the other."
Genesis,47,22,"He didn't buy any land from the priests because they already had their own piece of land that Pharaoh gave them, and they ate from it. That's why they didn't sell their property."
Genesis,47,23,"So Joseph was like, yo guys, check it out, I just got you and your land on behalf of Pharaoh. And I got some seeds for you too, so you can start planting and stuff."
Genesis,47,24,"When the harvest comes, you gotta give one-fifth to Pharaoh, and four-fifths are yours to keep. Use it for planting crops, feeding yourselves, taking care of your families, and making sure the little ones have enough to eat."
Genesis,47,25,"And they were like, dude, you totally saved our lives! We hope you're cool with us and we would be totally down to work for Pharaoh if that's cool with you, my lord."
Genesis,47,26,"So Joseph established a rule in Egypt that is still followed today, where Pharaoh receives one-fifth of everything produced, except for the land belonging to the priests. They do not belong to Pharaoh."
Genesis,47,27,"So basically, Israel was living it up in Egypt, specifically in this place called Goshen. They were doing pretty well for themselves, got some nice stuff, and their numbers were growing like crazy."
Genesis,47,28,"So Jacob stayed in Egypt for seventeen years, and he lived to be one hundred forty-seven years old in total. #justlivin'life"
Genesis,47,29,"The day approached when it was time for Israel to pass away. So he called his son Joseph and said to him, 'If I have earned your favor, can you please promise me this? Place your hand under my thigh as a sign of trust and treat me with kindness and honesty. Please don't bury me in Egypt'."
Genesis,47,30,"But when I pass away, I want you to take me out of Egypt and lay me to rest alongside my ancestors. And he replied, saying, I will do exactly as you have requested."
Genesis,47,31,"And he was like, dude, promise me, and he was like, yeah, I promise. And Israel was all humble and respectful.""}"
Genesis,48,1,"So, like, there was this time when someone came up to Joseph and was like, 'Yo dude, your dad's sick and stuff.' And then Joseph was all, Wordd?' and he took his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, and went to see his dad."
Genesis,48,2,"Someone went up to Jacob and said, 'Yo, check it, your son Joseph is heading your way.' And Israel, feeling pumped up, took a seat on the bed."
Genesis,48,3,"So Jacob was like, 'Yo Joseph, listen up! God, the Ultimate Power, straight up showed up to me in Luz, in Canaan, and blessed me big time.'"
Genesis,48,4,"And then he told me, listen up, I'm gonna make you super successful and make you multiply like crazy. You're gonna become a huge community of people, and this land will be passed down to your descendants forever, like a never-ending possession."
Genesis,48,5,"And now your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to you in Egypt before I came to Egypt, are now mine. They will be treated as if they were my own sons, just like Reuben and Simeon."
Genesis,48,6,"And the kids you have after them will be yours, and they'll be known by the name of their siblings when it comes to inheriting."
Genesis,48,7,"And like, dude, when I was coming back from Padan, Rachel passed away, you know, she died, in Canaan, on our journey. We were so close to reaching Ephrath, just a little way left. So, I buried her there on the road to Ephrath, which is actually Bethlehem."
Genesis,48,8,"And Israel saw Joseph's sons and was like, who dis?"
Genesis,48,9,"So Joseph was like, 'Yo dad, these are my boys that God hooked me up with here.' And he was like, 'Yo, bring 'em over here and I'll give 'em my blessings.'"" }"
Genesis,48,10,Israel's eyes were getting old and he couldn't see very well. He brought them close to him and gave them a kiss and a warm hug.
Genesis,48,11,"And Israel was like, 'Yo Joseph, I never thought I'd see your face again, but yo, God just blessed me by letting me see your fam too.'"" }"
Genesis,48,12,And Joseph helped them up from his lap and respectfully bowed down with his face to the ground.
Genesis,48,13,"Then Joseph grabbed both of them. He raised Ephraim in his right hand, closer to Israel's left hand, and he held Manasseh in his left hand, closer to Israel's right hand. And he brought them close to him."
Genesis,48,14,"Israel reached out his right hand and placed it on Ephraim's head, who was the younger one. Then he placed his left hand on Manasseh's head, intentionally guiding his hands. This was because Manasseh was the firstborn."
Genesis,48,15,"And he gave Joseph his blessing, saying, the God that my fathers Abraham and Isaac worshiped, the God who has provided for me throughout my whole life until now,"
Genesis,48,16,"May the Angel who saved me from all harm bless these young ones. May they carry my name, and the names of my forefathers Abraham and Isaac. May they thrive and multiply, just like fish in the ocean."
Genesis,48,17,"So, like, Joseph noticed that his dad was putting his right hand on Ephraim's head and it totally bothered him. He actually tried to move his dad's hand from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head. Can you believe it? Joseph was not cool with that at all."
Genesis,48,18,"And Joseph was like, 'Hold up, dad. Nah, that's not it. Reuben is the oldest, so you gotta put your right hand on his head.'"" }"

Genesis,50,11,"So, like, when the peeps who lived in Canaan saw the Egyptians grieving at Atad, they were like, dang, this mourning is super intense. That's why they named the place Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan. Abelmizraim means the mourning of the Egyptians, ya know."
Genesis,50,12,And his sons followed his instructions just as he told them to do:
Genesis,50,13,"His sons took him to the land of Canaan and laid him to rest in the cave of the field of Machpelah. This cave was bought by Abraham as a burial site from Ephron the Hittite, near Mamre."
Genesis,50,14,"So like, after Joseph buried his father, he went back to Egypt with his brothers and all the peeps who went with them to bury him."

Genesis,50,17,"Yo, Joseph, could you please forgive your bros for the messed up stuff they did to you? They did some straight up evil. We're asking you, please forgive them for the mistakes made by the people who serve your dad's God. Joseph got all emotional and started crying when they talked to him like that."
Genesis,50,18,"And his siblings also went and bowed down before him; and they said, Look, we are here to serve you."
Genesis,50,19,"And Joseph was like, yo don't be stressed out. Cos like, am I, some regular dude, supposed to take over God's job or what?"
Genesis,50,20,"But yo, you were hating on me, straight up evil thoughts and all. But, check it, God had a whole different plan in mind. He turned that negativity into a positive outcome, making it all happen just like it is today. And the result? Saving so many lives, man."

Genesis,50,25,"So, Joseph made the Israelite peeps promise, like, for real, that God's gonna come check them out, and when that happens, they gotta make sure to bring my bones up outta here."

Exodus,1,1,"So, here's the deal. These are the names of the children of Israel who made their way to Egypt. Each person, along with their fam, rolled with Jacob."
Exodus,1,2,"Yo, fam! Check out these OG brothers: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,"
Exodus,1,3,"Issa, Zeb, and Benji,"
Exodus,1,4,"Yo, it's Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher."
Exodus,1,5,"So, like, all the people who came from Jacob's fam were like seventy in total, 'cause Joseph was already livin' it up in Egypt, you know? Oh, and when it says 'loins', it actually means 'thigh' in Hebrew, just an FYI."
Exodus,1,6,"And Joseph passed away, along with all his squad, and everyone from that OG crew."
Exodus,1,7,"So, like, the Israelite kids were totally productive and grown big time, and they multiplied like crazy, becoming super strong; and the whole land was, like, totally packed with them."
Exodus,1,8,"So basically, there was this new ruler in Egypt who had no clue who Joseph was."
Exodus,1,9,"Yo, listen up fam, check this out: Them Israelites, man, they be mad deep and straight up powerful compared to us, ya know?"
Exodus,1,10,"Alright, listen up, let's handle this situation smartly; otherwise, they might increase in numbers and if a war breaks out, they might team up with our enemies and end up leaving our land."
Exodus,1,11,"So they appointed supervisors to make them suffer under heavy workloads. And they constructed cities of wealth, Pithom and Raamses, for Pharaoh."
Exodus,1,12,"But like, the more they messed with the Israelites, the more they multiplied and thrived. And, it totally annoyed them because of the big Israelite fam."
Exodus,1,13,"So, like, the Egyptians totally forced the Israelites to work super hard and be slaves and stuff:"
Exodus,1,14,"And they made life miserable for them with tough, grueling work. They forced them to work with morter, bricks, and all sorts of labor in the fields. Every task they were given was filled with harshness and severity."
Exodus,1,15,"So, like, the pharaoh dude in Egypt had a chat with these two Hebrew midwives, ya know? One was named Shiphrah and the other was called Puah. Pretty simple, right?"
Exodus,1,16,"And he was like, when you're helping the Hebrew ladies give birth and you see them on the birthing stools, if it's a boy, you gotta like, kill him. But if it's a girl, then she can keep on living."
Exodus,1,17,"But the midwives were totally in awe of God, and they were like, 'Nah, no way are we gonna do what the king of Egypt told us to do!' They made sure to keep all the baby boys safe and sound."
Exodus,1,18,"So the Pharaoh summoned the midwives and asked them, like, why did you let those baby boys live? What's the deal?"
Exodus,1,19,"So the midwives told Pharaoh, like, the Hebrew women are just different from the Egyptian women, you know? They're so energetic and give birth really quickly, even before we get a chance to show up."
Exodus,1,20,"So God totally blessed the midwives, and the population blew up and became super strong."
Exodus,1,21,"So, like, because the midwives were pretty scared of God and stuff, He was like, 'Yo, I'm gonna give you guys some fancy houses.'"
Exodus,1,22,"So Pharaoh told everyone, like, hear me out guys, I want you to throw all the baby boys into the river, but, like, save all the baby girls, okay?"
Exodus,2,1,So this guy from the Levi fam ended up marrying a girl from the same fam.
Exodus,2,2,"And the woman got pregnant and had a baby boy. When she saw how awesome he looked, she kept him hidden for three months."
Exodus,2,3,"So, when she couldn't hide him anymore, she grabbed a fancy raft and gave it a makeover with some sticky stuff. Then, she tucked the baby inside and gently placed it among the reeds by the river's edge."
Exodus,2,4,"And his sis was like watching from a distance, curious to see what was gonna happen to him."
Exodus,2,5,"So like, the Pharaoh's daughter went to the river to take a dip, with her girls nearby. And guess what? She spotted this cool floating thing in the reeds. She was like, 'Go grab that thing,' and sent one of her girls to get it."
Exodus,2,6,"And when she looked inside, she saw the baby crying. It touched her heart, and she said, 'This is one of the Hebrews' kids.'"
Exodus,2,7,"So the sister was like, 'Hey Pharaoh's daughter, should I find a Hebrew lady to take care of the baby for you?'"
Exodus,2,8,"Pharaoh's daughter was like, 'Sure, go ahead.' So the maid dipped and hit up the child's actual mom."
Exodus,2,9,"Pharaoh's daughter was like, 'Yo, take this kid and raise him for me, and I'll hook you up with some cash.' So the woman grabbed the baby and did the nursing thing."
Exodus,2,10,"As the kid grew up, the woman took him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he officially became her son. She named him Moses, and explained that it was because she saved him from the water."
Exodus,2,11,"So, like, back in the day when Moses became all grown up and stuff, he went out to hang with his homies, and he saw how much they were struggling with their loads. And guess what? He caught this Egyptian dude hitting a Hebrew, who was actually part of his squad. Can you believe it?"
Exodus,2,12,"So, he like, checked out both sides, and when he realized there was no one around, he straight up took down the Egyptian bro and buried him in the sand."
Exodus,2,13,"So, like, the next day this guy goes out and, whoa, he sees these two Hebrew dudes going all out, arguing and stuff. And he's like, yo dude who started it, why you gotta be hitting your bro like that?"
Exodus,2,14,"And he was like, 'Yo, who made you the boss and the judge over us? Are you trying to end me like you did to that Egyptian dude?' And Moses got scared and was like, 'Dang, this is gonna get out, isn't it?'"
Exodus,2,15,"So, like, when Pharaoh found out about what Moses did, he was totally out for blood. But Moses bailed and escaped Pharaoh's wrath, and ended up chilling in Midian. And you know what? He just plopped himself down by a well and kicked it there."
Exodus,2,16,"So, this dude who was like a priest in Midian had these seven daughters and they went to draw some water and fill up the troughs to water their dad's flock. (By the way, the word priestt' could also mean 'prince' here.)"
Exodus,2,17,"So, like, the shepherds were there and they were all being annoying and stuff, but then Moses was like, 'Nah fam, I got you!' He came to the rescue, helped them out, and made sure their sheep were taken care of. No worries, fam."
Exodus,2,18,"When they arrived at their dad Reuel, he was like, 'How'd you guys get here so fast today?' (P.S. Reuel is also known as Jethro or Jether)"
Exodus,2,19,"They were like, OMG, this totally fine Egyptian guy saved us from those shepherds and even hooked us up with enough H2O for everyone and watered the whole flock. Like, power moves!"
Exodus,2,20,"He was like, 'Yo, where's that guy at? Why did y'all leave him? Go get him so he can grab a bite to eat.'"
Exodus,2,21,"Moses was totally vibing with the guy and decided to hang out. The guy was like, 'Bro, you're cool. Have my daughter Zipporah as a gift.'"
Exodus,2,22,"And she had a baby boy, and he gave him the name Gershom. Because he felt like an outsider in a totally unfamiliar place. (Gershom means 'a stranger here')"
Exodus,2,23,"So, like, after a while, the pharaoh of Egypt passed away, and the Israelite peeps were totally fed up with being enslaved. They couldn't take it anymore, ya know? They cried out in desperation, and their cries reached God because of the super harsh slavery and all."
Exodus,2,24,"And God was like: I hear you, fam. And God was like, 'yo, I remember the deal I made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.'"
Exodus,2,25,"And God saw the Israelites and was like, 'Hey, I'm feeling them vibes.'"
Exodus,3,1,"Yo, Moses was looking after Jethro's flock, who was his father-in-law and a priest of Midian. He took the flock to a chill spot in the desert and ended up at God's mountain, also known as Horeb."
Exodus,3,2,"So like, the LORD's angel showed up to him in this sick flame of fire that was like coming out of this bush. And he looked, right, and like, the bush was legit on fire but it wasn't getting destroyed or anything. It was wild."
Exodus,3,3,"So Moses was like, 'Yo, I gotta check this out. Why is this bush on fire but not getting roasted?'"
Exodus,3,4,"And when the LORD peeped that he was curious to check it out, God hit him up from the epicenter of the bush and was like, Mosess, Moses.' Then he was like, 'Here I am.'"
Exodus,3,5,"And he was like, yeah bro, don't come closer, take off your shoes, dude. This place you're standing on is like, super sacred and stuff."
Exodus,3,6,"Yo, he was like, 'Just so you know, I'm your dad's God. The same God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.' Moses was totally shook and covered his face 'cause he was too scared to even look at God."
Exodus,3,7,"Yo, God was like, I totally peeped the struggles of my squad in Egypt and heard their cries because of their bosses. Trust me, I know they're going through some tough times."
Exodus,3,8,"So like, I'm totally here to rescue them from those Egyptians and take them to this amazing land, dude! It's like super lush and abundant, overflowing with milk and honey, you know? It's where the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites are hanging out, by the way."
Exodus,3,9,"So, listen up, guys! The Israelites are reaching out to me, and let me tell ya, I've totally noticed how the Egyptians are treating them, all oppressive and stuff."
Exodus,3,10,"Hey, listen up! Time to make moves - I'm about to send you straight to Pharaoh's doorstep. Your mission? Free the children of Israel from Egypt, no less!"
Exodus,3,11,"Yo, God, why me? Like, who am I to go to Pharaoh and free the Israelites from Egypt?"
Exodus,3,12,"And he was like, totally down to hang with you. And here's how you'll know I sent you: Once you've rescued the peeps from Egypt, you'll worship God on this sick mountain."
Exodus,3,13,"So Moses was like, yo God, listen up. When I go to the Israelites and tell them, 'Hey, the God our ancestors believed in sent me to you', and they're like, 'What's His name, dude?'. What should I tell 'em?"
Exodus,3,14,"And God was like, 'Yo Moses, I'm all about that self-existence, I just am who I am, you know? So tell the Israelite kids that I'm the one who sent you, like, I exist and stuff.'"
Exodus,3,15,"Yo, Moses, God got another message for ya. Tell the Israel squad that the OG LORD God of your fam - Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob - sent me to deliver a message. This is gonna be my name forever, a constant reminder for all future generations."
Exodus,3,16,"Yo, go and gather all the OGs of Israel and tell 'em: The LORD God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, came through and appeared to me. He said, 'I've legit checked out what's been going down with you in Egypt.'"
Exodus,3,17,"I promise to rescue you from all the tough times in Egypt and take you to a dope land filled with the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. It's gonna be lit, flowing with milk and honey!"
Exodus,3,18,"And they'll totally listen to what you're saying, and you're gonna roll up, along with the OGs of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you're gonna be like, 'Yo, the LORD God of the Hebrews has been vibing with us, and now we're asking you, can we dip for a three-day trip into the wild, just to make some sacrifices to the LORD our God?'"
Exodus,3,19,"I'm totally confident that the king of Egypt won't set you free, not even with a massive display of force. {or, but with a strong show of power}"
Exodus,3,20,"And then I'm gonna flex, and hit Egypt with all my epic miracles that I'm gonna pull off right in the middle of it. And once that's done, he's gonna finally let you bounce."
Exodus,3,21,"And I'll make sure these peeps get mad respect from the Egyptians: and trust, when you bounce, you won't be left empty-handed:"
Exodus,3,22,"Every girl can ask her friend or the girl staying in her house for some cool silver and gold accessories and trendy clothes. Then you can totally make your sons and daughters look fly by decking them out with those stuff, and snag all the sweet loot from the Egyptians. (the Egyptians: or, Egypt)"
Exodus,4,1,"And Moses was like, umm, listen up, what if they don't believe me or listen to what I gotta say? They gonna be like, 'Nah, dude, the Big Guy upstairs didn't show Himself to you.'"
Exodus,4,2,"And God was like, 'Yo, what's that thing you holding?' And he was like, 'Bro, it's a rod.'"
Exodus,4,3,"Then he was like, 'Yo, throw it on the ground.' So he tossed it down, and it transformed into a snake. Moses straight up dipped and ran away from that thing."
Exodus,4,4,"So God said to Moses, just reach out your hand and grab it by the tail. And Moses did it, he reached out his hand, grabbed it, and it turned into a cool staff in his hand:"
Exodus,4,5,"So they'll believe that the LORD God, the OG God of their ancestors – Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob – actually pulled up on you."
Exodus,4,6,"Then God told him to like, put his hand in his hoodie pocket, you know? So he did it and when he pulled it out, his hand was all covered in nasty leprosy, like super white and gross."
Exodus,4,7,"And he was like, 'Yo, put your hand back into your hoodie.' So dude put his hand back in and took it out, and yo, it was totally back to normal, like his other skin and stuff."
Exodus,4,8,"So like, if they don't believe you or listen to the first sign, they'll totally believe the second sign, you know?"
Exodus,4,9,"If they don't even believe these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the river and pour it on the dry ground. Then that water you take from the river will totally turn into blood on the dry ground."
Exodus,4,10,"So Moses was like, 'Yo, God, I gotta be real with you. I ain't exactly the smoothest talker, never have been, even after you spoke to me. I struggle to find the right words and get my point across.' (Just so you know, 'eloquent' means a person who's good with words and 'heretofore' means since yesterday or even the day before that.)"
Exodus,4,11,"And the LORD was like, 'Yo, who created our mouths? Like, who's responsible for making people unable to speak or hear or see or even go blind? Oh, right, it's me, the LORD."
Exodus,4,12,"So, like, go now and don't worry, I'll totally be with you and teach you what to say."
Exodus,4,13,"And he was like, yo Lord, just send someone already, like whoever you want to send bro. You know what I'm sayin', like you make the call or whatever."
Exodus,4,14,"So like, God got pretty mad at Moses, and He was all like, 'Yo, isn't Aaron your bro? I know he's a smooth talker and stuff. Plus, check it out, he's on his way to see you, and he's gonna be stoked when he sees you.'"
Exodus,4,15,"Just talk to him and give him the words to say. I'll be there speaking through both of you, teaching you what to do."
Exodus,4,16,"He's gonna be your hype man for the squad, straight up. He'll be your voice when dealing with the people, kinda like your personal PR manager. You'll be his support, like a legit ride-or-die, and he'll hold you down like your personal divine connection."
Exodus,4,17,"Yo, grab this rod and work some insane miraculous stuff with it."
Exodus,4,18,"So Moses bounced back and went to his father-in-law Jethro. He was like, 'Yo, let me dip and go back to my peeps in Egypt. I need to check if they're still kicking.' Jethro was cool about it and told Moses to peace out."
Exodus,4,19,"Yo, Moses, listen up! The big man upstairs, the LORD, spoke to you when you were chillin' in Midian. He told you to head back to Egypt, 'cause all those dudes who wanted to take you out are now six feet under."
Exodus,4,20,"So Moses grabbed his wife and his kids, and they rode on a donkey as they went back to Egypt. And Moses made sure to bring along God's magical rod as well."
Exodus,4,21,"God was like, 'Yo, Moses, when you head back to Egypt, make sure you show Pharaoh all those cool miracles I gave you the power to do. But just a heads up, I'm gonna make sure Pharaoh's heart is stubborn so he won't let the people go.'"
Exodus,4,22,"Yo, go tell Pharaoh that the LORD says Israel is like my OG child, the firstborn and all that."
Exodus,4,23,"Yo, listen up! I'm telling you, release my son so he can do his thing serving me. But if you straight up refuse to let him go, just know, I'm about to take out your firstborn, no joke."
Exodus,4,24,"So, like, this thing happened when this dude was staying at an inn, and then the LORD showed up and, like, had major beef with him and wanted to, you know, kill him."
Exodus,4,25,"So Zipporah grabbed a sharp tool and cut off her son's foreskin, then threw it at his feet. She said to Moses, 'You are truly a husband covered in blood to me.'"
Exodus,4,26,"Bruh, he was like, Peacee out, dude.' And then she's all like, 'Dude, you're such a bloody hubby now because of that whole circumcision thing.'"
Exodus,4,27,"And God was like, 'Yo Aaron, head to the wilderness and link up with Moses.' So Aaron dipped and they linked up at God's mountain, and they were like, 'Bro, good to see you!' and hugged it out."
Exodus,4,28,So Moses told Aaron everything that the LORD had said to him and all the cool things he wanted Aaron to do.
Exodus,4,29,"So Moses and Aaron were like, 'Let's round up all the OGs of the Israelite squad:'"
Exodus,4,30,"Yo, Aaron was like straight up speaking all the words that the LORD had spoken to Moses, and he even flexed with some mad signs in front of the people, you know?"
Exodus,4,31,"And the people were like, totally convinced: and when they heard that the LORD had come through for the children of Israel, and that he was all like concerned about their struggles, then they were low-key in awe and showed mad respect by bowing their heads and worshiping."
Exodus,5,1,"So Moses and Aaron entered, and they told Pharaoh, This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Let my people go, so they can throw a lit celebration for me in the wilderness."
Exodus,5,2,"Pharaoh was like, who even is this LORD dude? Why should I listen to him and let Israel bounce? I have no clue who this LORD is, and I'm definitely not giving Israel freedom."
Exodus,5,3,"So they were like, 'Yo, the God of the Hebrews totally showed up, fam. Let's bounce and take, like, a three-day trip to the desert and offer sacrifices to the LORD our God. If we don't do this, we might catch some crazy plague or get rekt by swords.'"
Exodus,5,4,"So the king of Egypt was like, why are you, Moses and Aaron, letting the people slack off from their work? Go back to your own responsibilities."
Exodus,5,5,"Yo, Pharaoh was like, check it out, there's a huge crowd here and y'all out here giving them a break from their hard work."
Exodus,5,6,"So Pharaoh like, straight up told the bosses and their peeps to get to work on this day, no delays or playing around,"
Exodus,5,7,"You ain't gotta provide the people with straw to make bricks no more, like you used to. Just let 'em go and gather their own straw."
Exodus,5,8,"So, like, the deal is that those guys should still make the same number of bricks as before, not even one less because they're just chilling and complaining, saying that they wanna dip and worship their God."
Exodus,5,9,"Yo, give the dudes more tasks to hustle on, so they can grind it out and not waste time on dumb talk. #NoTimeForNonsense"
Exodus,5,10,"So, like, the people in charge, you know, the taskmasters and officers, they went to talk to the people and were like, 'Yo, Pharaoh said he ain't gonna give you any straw, just so you know.'"
Exodus,5,11,"Hey, go and grab some straw wherever you can find it, but don't worry, they won't reduce the amount of work you have to do."
Exodus,5,12,"So, all the people were scattered throughout the whole land of Egypt, looking for stubble instead of straw."
Exodus,5,13,"The bosses were like, 'Yo, hustle up and get your stuff done, your daily grind, just like when we had all the resources we needed. In a day's work, get it done!'"
Exodus,5,14,"So, like, the bosses that Pharaoh put in charge of the Israelites totally gave them a hard time. They got punished and were all like, 'Why didn't you finish making bricks yesterday and today, like you used to?'"
Exodus,5,15,"So, like, the leaders of the Israelites went up to Pharaoh and straight up asked him, 'Dude, seriously, why are you treating us like this?'"
Exodus,5,16,"They didn't give us any straw, and now they're telling us to make bricks. And guess what? Your workers are beating us. But it's not our fault, it's your people's fault."
Exodus,5,17,"But he's like, dude, you're wallowing in laziness, seriously: that's why you're all like, 'Let's bounce and make a sacrifice to the LORD.'"
Exodus,5,18,"So like, get to work ASAP! But yo, they're not gonna hook you up with any straw, but still, you gotta make sure to deliver those bricks, alright?"
Exodus,5,19,"So, like, the leaders of the Israelite peeps realized that things were getting pretty bad when they were told they couldn't even reduce the amount of bricks they had to make each day."
Exodus,5,20,"So Moses and Aaron ran into each other, blocking the path, after they left Pharaoh's place:"
Exodus,5,21,"And they were like, OMG, may the LORD low-key see what you did and judge you, because you, like, totally made Pharaoh and his squad hate us even more! They wanna come at us with their swords and, like, slay us. Such a total disaster, man! #Frustrated"
Exodus,5,22,"So Moses goes back to God and is like, 'Yo, why are you treating these people so badly? What's the point of sending me here?'"
Exodus,5,23,"Ever since I went to Pharaoh to convey your message, he has been straight up causing trouble for these peeps. And to be real, it seems like you haven't even come through to save your people at all. Like nada, zip, zero. #disappointed"
Exodus,6,1,"And God was like, 'Yo, Moses, get ready to witness the epicness I'm about to unleash on Pharaoh. He's gonna be so shook that he'll be forced to let my people go, like, real forcefully and kick them all out of his territory with some serious power moves.'"
Exodus,6,2,"And God like, talked to Moses and was all like, I am the LORD, you know, the almighty one and stuff, like JEHOVAH n' all."
Exodus,6,3,"So, like, I showed up to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty, ya know? But, like, they didn't really know me by my name JEHOVAH. It wasn't, like, part of our vibe back then, you know what I'm saying?"
Exodus,6,4,"And just FYI, I made a really tight agreement with them, promising to hook them up with the land of Canaan, you know, that spot where they were just wanderin' around like total newbies."
Exodus,6,5,"And yo, I've totally heard the struggle of the Israelite peeps, kept under the Egyptians' control. And you know what? I haven't forgotten about the covenant I made with them!"
Exodus,6,6,"Yo, listen up Israelites! I'm the LORD and I'm about to flex on those Egyptians. I'm gonna free you from their heavy burdens, deliver you from their slavery, and save y'all with my mighty power and epic judgments."
Exodus,6,7,"And I'm gonna make you my peeps, like, you'll be my squad, and I'm gonna be your ultimate plug, you know? You'll totally realize that I'm the LORD your God, the one who's totally freeing you from all that slave labor in Egypt."
Exodus,6,8,"And I'll totally hook you up with that promised land I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It's gonna be all yours, no doubt. I'm the boss, BTW. (Hebrew meaning high-five)"
Exodus,6,9,"So Moses was like, 'Yo, fam, listen up' to the children of Israel. But they were not about to listen because they were hella stressed out and dealing with some seriously messed up oppression, you feel? Like, their spirits were crushed and they were caught up in this wickedly unfair situation. {anguish: You know, feeling totally cramped and trapped}"
Exodus,6,10,"So, like, God talked to Moses and was all like,"
Exodus,6,11,"Yo, go and talk to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and tell him to let the Israelites bounce outta his turf."
Exodus,6,12,"So, like, Moses was talking to God and he was all like, 'Dude, the Israelites aren't even listening to me! How am I supposed to get Pharaoh to listen when I'm not all eloquent and stuff?'"
Exodus,6,13,"So, like, the LORD was talking to Moses and Aaron, and He was all like, 'Yo, I've got a mission for y'all. You gotta go to the children of Israel and Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and tell 'em to get the Israelites outta Egypt.'"
Exodus,6,14,"These are the OG leaders of their families: The squad of Reuben, the oldest of Israel's sons; Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. These are the fams of Reuben."
Exodus,6,15,"And Simeon's crew was lit, with Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul repping hard. Shaul's mom was a Canaanite, no cap. These were the homies rollin' with Simeon."
Exodus,6,16,"So, these are the names of the sons of Levi, you know, following their generations: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. And Levi lived for, like, a hundred and thirty-seven years, which is pretty impressive."
Exodus,6,17,"The squad of Gershon; Libni and Shimi, reppin' their own fams."
Exodus,6,18,"So, there were four dudes called Kohath's sons: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. Kohath lived for a solid 133 years. Like, that's a decent run, you know?"
Exodus,6,19,"The fam of Levi had two chill dudes called Mahali and Mushi, who were the sons of Merari. That's the whole fam vibe sorted, yo."
Exodus,6,20,"And Amram decided to marry his aunt Jochebed, his father's sister. They had two sons named Aaron and Moses. Amram lived to be a super impressive one hundred and thirty-seven years old!"
Exodus,6,21,"Izhar had some cool kids like Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri."
Exodus,6,22,"And Uzziel had three sons: Mishael, Elzaphan, and Zithri."
Exodus,6,23,"And then Aaron got together with Elisheba, who was Amminadab's daughter and Naashon's sister, and they became a couple. They had four kids named Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar."
Exodus,6,24,"And the squad of Korah was lit with Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph in the fam gang. This be the crew of the Korhites, no cap."
Exodus,6,25,"And then Eleazar, Aaron's son, married one of the daughters of Putiel, and they had Phinehas. These are the OG leaders of the Levites, representing their fams."
Exodus,6,26,"So, like, these dudes Aaron and Moses, the LORD was all like, yo, tell the children of Israel to bounce from Egypt with their squads."
Exodus,6,27,"Yo, these are the peeps who talked to Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, and convinced him to let the Israelite kids bounce from that place. Moses and Aaron were the ones making it happen."
Exodus,6,28,"So, like, one day when the Big Man upstairs, the LORD, was talking to Moses in, like, Egypt land,"
Exodus,6,29,"So, like, God totally spoke to Moses and was all like, 'Yo, I'm the LORD, dude!' And He told Moses to go talk to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and spill all the tea about everything I'm telling you, like, no holding back, man."
Exodus,6,30,"So, Moses was like, 'Yo, God, you see, my way of speaking isn't the greatest, like I ain't got that smooth tongue. How can I expect Pharaoh to listen to me then? Like, it's gonna be tough, you know?'}"
Exodus,7,1,"Yo, Moses, listen up! Check it out, I'm about to elevate your status in Pharaoh's eyes. You'll be like a legit god to him, and your bro, Aaron, will be your hype man, spreading your divine message."
Exodus,7,2,"You gotta say everything that I tell you: and Aaron, your bro, will talk to Pharaoh, and be like, 'Yo, let the peeps of Israel bounce from your land.'"
Exodus,7,3,"And I'll make Pharaoh's heart stubborn, and crank up the number of epic miracles and mind-blowing tricks I'll perform in Egypt."
Exodus,7,4,"But Pharaoh ain't gonna listen to you, so I can flex my power over Egypt and rescue my squad, the Israelites, outta Egypt with some epic judgments."
Exodus,7,5,"And like, the Egyptians are gonna be woke AF and realize that I, God, am the absolute boss when I flex on Egypt and free the Israelite fam from their grip."
Exodus,7,6,"So Moses and Aaron totally followed what the LORD told them to do, no questions asked. They were all about that divine obedience, and they nailed it!"
Exodus,7,7,"So like, Moses was, like, 80 years old, and Aaron was, like, 83 years old, when they talked to Pharaoh."
Exodus,7,8,"So, like, God starts talking to Moses and Aaron, right? He's all like,"
Exodus,7,9,"So, like, when Pharaoh comes up to you and is all like, 'Yo, show me a sick trick', you gotta be like, Aaronn, bro, grab your rod and throw it down in front of Pharaoh'. And bam! It'll turn into a full-on snake, dude."
Exodus,7,10,"So, Moses and Aaron straight up walked into Pharaoh's crib and they totally did what the LORD had ordered: Aaron straight up dropped his staff in front of Pharaoh and his squad, and boom! It turned into a freaking snake."
Exodus,7,11,"So Pharaoh was like, 'I need some extra brain power!' and he called in the wise guys and the sorcery squad - those Egyptian magicians who were all about their enchantments. And guess what? They totally did the same tricks, like, no big deal."
Exodus,7,12,"So, like, everyone threw down their rods and they became snakes. But Aaron's rod, you know, totally swallowed up their rods."
Exodus,7,13,"And God made Pharaoh's heart stubborn, so he didn't listen to them, just like God said."
Exodus,7,14,"Yo, the LORD was like, Mosess, listen up! Pharaoh's heart is straight up rock solid, dude's straight up refusing to let the people bounce.'"
Exodus,7,15,"Go to Pharaoh in the morning, he's heading to the water. Stand by the river's edge until he arrives, and don't forget to bring the rod that turned into a serpent in your hand."
Exodus,7,16,"Yo, tell him this: the LORD God of the Hebrews hit me up and sent me to you, saying, let my peeps bounce so they can worship me in the wild. But dude, you ain't been listenin' so far."
Exodus,7,17,"Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD says: I'm about to show you that I'm the real deal. Check it, I'm gonna smack the waters in the river with my rod and bam! They're gonna turn into blood."
Exodus,7,18,"And like, all the fish in the river are gonna die and the whole river is gonna smell SO bad! The Egyptians are gonna be super grossed out and totally not wanna drink the water anymore."
Exodus,7,19,"And God talked to Moses and said, 'Yo Aaron, grab your rod and wave your hand over all the water in Egypt - the streams, the rivers, the ponds, even the pools - and turn it all into blood. Let blood flow across the whole land of Egypt, even in wooden and stone containers.'"
Exodus,7,20,"So Moses and Aaron did what the LORD said, and Moses raised his staff and struck the water in the river. Everyone, including Pharaoh and his peeps, saw how the river turned into blood."
Exodus,7,21,"So, like, all the fish in the river died, and it turned super nasty and stinky, and the Egyptians couldn't even drink the water from the river. And to top it off, the whole land of Egypt was covered in blood, man."
Exodus,7,22,"The sorcerers of Egypt also did it with their totally magical moves, but Pharaoh's heart stayed stubborn and he didn't even pay them any attention, just like the LORD predicted."
Exodus,7,23,"Then Pharaoh dipped and bounced to his crib, and he didn't even bother with this."
Exodus,7,24,"So, like, all the Egyptians were totally digging around the river looking for drinkable water because they couldn't even drink the water that was in the river."
Exodus,7,25,"And after a whole week, once the LORD hit that river, it was a wrap."
Exodus,8,1,"So, like, God was talking to Moses, and He told him to go talk to Pharaoh. And He was like, 'Tell Pharaoh this message from Me: Let my people go, so they can worship Me.'"
Exodus,8,2,"And, like, if you're not down to let my peeps go, get ready for a serious frog invasion happening all over your territory, man:"
Exodus,8,3,"And the river's gonna be flooded with frogs, like, there's gonna be a ton of 'em. They're gonna be all up in your house, in your room, even on your bed. They'll be in your servants' houses too, and all over your people. They'll even find their way into your kitchen and your baking equipment, like ovens and dough mixers. Yeah, it's gonna be wild."
Exodus,8,4,"And like, there will be frogs, everywhere... like, on you, your peeps, and all your squad."
Exodus,8,5,"So, God told Moses, like, go tell Aaron to, like, stretch out his hand with his staff or whatever over the streams, rivers, and ponds, and make frogs appear all over Egypt."
Exodus,8,6,"So Aaron totally flexed and put his hand over the waters in Egypt. And then boom! Frogs started popping up everywhere, and they took over the whole land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,7,And the magicians used their magic tricks and conjured up a bunch of frogs all over Egypt.
Exodus,8,8,"So, Pharaoh hit up Moses and Aaron and was like, 'Yo, can you ask the LORD to get rid of these annoying frogs? They're buggin' me and my crew. And if you make it happen, I’m down to let the people bounce and do their sacrifice thing for the LORD.'"
Exodus,8,9,"Yo, Pharaoh, listen up. When do you want me to ask the big guy upstairs to do something about these frogs infesting your crib and your peeps'? I mean, can we at least keep 'em in the river? It's all up to you, man. Just say the word and I'll make it happen."
Exodus,8,10,"And he was like, 'Yeah, tomorrow.' And he was like, 'Okay, cool. Let it happen just like you said, so you know that there's no one else as awesome as the LORD our God.'"
Exodus,8,11,"And the frogs will peace out from you, your cribz, your squad, and your homies; they'll just chill in the river, y'know."
Exodus,8,12,"So Moses and Aaron bounced outta Pharaoh's crib, and Moses straight up hit up the big man upstairs 'cause of those mad annoying frogs he unleashed on Pharaoh."
Exodus,8,13,"So, like, God totally did what Moses said, and the frogs all died out of people's houses, the towns, and the fields."
Exodus,8,14,And they piled them up in big stacks: and the whole place smelled awful.
Exodus,8,15,"But when Pharaoh realized he had a break, he stubbornly refused to listen to them, just like the LORD said."
Exodus,8,16,"Yo, the Big Guy upstairs told Moses to tell Aaron to flex his rod and smack the dust of the land. That way, it's gonna turn into lice all over Egypt."
Exodus,8,17,"So Aaron did his thing, he raised his hand with his rod and BAM, he smacked the earth's dust and it turned into a swarm of lice. Not just on people, but on animals too! The whole land was infested with lice, from one end to the other throughout Egypt."
Exodus,8,18,"So the magicians tried their tricks to summon lice, but totally failed: the result? People and animals were both infested with lice."
Exodus,8,19,"So like, the magicians were all like, 'Yo Pharaoh, this is totally God flexing His power', but Pharaoh was like, so stubborn and didn't even listen to them, just like how the LORD said it would be."
Exodus,8,20,"And God was like, 'Yo, Moses, wake up early in the morning and go stand in front of Pharaoh. Dude's heading to the water and here's what you gotta say to him: God says, 'Let my people go, so they can worship me.'"
Exodus,8,21,"Yo, if you don't free my peeps, brace yourself 'cause I'm about to unleash hella flies on you, your crew, your whole squad, and even up in your crib. The Egyptians gonna have their houses straight up infested with flies, and even the ground gonna be crawling with 'em."
Exodus,8,22,"And like, on that day, I'm gonna make this place called Goshen where my peeps live totally fly-free, just so you'll know I'm the Lord and I'm in charge of everything. Solid, right in the middle of the earth."
Exodus,8,23,"Yo, I'm gonna separate my peeps from your peeps: this lit sign will show up tomorrow. 💥"
Exodus,8,24,"And God made it happen; a bunch of annoying flies invaded Pharaoh's house, his servants' houses, and the entire land of Egypt. The land was messed up because of all those pesky flies buzzing around everywhere."
Exodus,8,25,"So Pharaoh hit up Moses and Aaron like, 'Ay, go do your sacrifice thing for your God right here in Egypt, you know?'"
Exodus,8,26,"And Moses was like, nah we can't do that, you feel me? We can't offer up the disgusting things that the Egyptians worship to the LORD our God. Like, imagine if we did that in front of them, they'd totally come at us with stones, no cap."
Exodus,8,27,"We're gonna trek through the wilderness for like three days and offer a sacrifice to the LORD our God, just like He tells us to do."
Exodus,8,28,"So Pharaoh was like, 'Okay, I'll let you guys bounce and do your worship thing in the wilderness, but don't go too far, and hey, put in a good word for me, alright? Keep me in your prayers, fam.'"
Exodus,8,29,"So Moses was like, 'Yo, I'm about to dip and talk to the big man upstairs. Gonna ask the LORD to make those pesky fly swarms buzz off from Pharaoh, his peeps, and his squad by tomorrow. But Pharaoh better stop playin' games and not keep holding back the peeps from going to do their worship thing for the LORD.'"
Exodus,8,30,So Moses bounced out of Pharaoh's crib and straight up pleaded with the LORD.
Exodus,8,31,"So, like, God totally did what Moses said and, like, got rid of all those annoying flies from Pharaoh, his peeps, and even his servants. Seriously, not a single fly was left."
Exodus,8,32,"And Pharaoh was like, totally stubborn once again, refusing to set the people free."
Exodus,9,1,"Yo, Moses, listen up. God is telling you to slide into Pharaoh's DMs and hit him with this message: Godd, the ultimate squad leader of the Hebrews, wants his peeps to be free from bondage so they can flex their worship game for him.'"
Exodus,9,2,"Like, if you're gonna keep refusing to let {them} go and just cling onto them,"
Exodus,9,3,"Yo, check it out! The Lord's power is gonna affect all your animals out in the field like cows, horses, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep. It's gonna be a seriously bad disease, dudes."
Exodus,9,4,"Yo, the LORD's gonna straight up separate the animals of Israel from those of Egypt, and none of the children of Israel's animals will die or anything. No worries, fam."
Exodus,9,5,"And God was like, 'Yo, listen up! Tomorrow I'm gonna make some epic moves happen in this place, you feel me?"
Exodus,9,6,"And the LORD did that thing the next day, and all the cows in Egypt died: but not a single cow belonging to the children of Israel died."
Exodus,9,7,"So Pharaoh hit 'em up and guess what? None of the Israelites' cows were dead. But Pharaoh's heart stayed stubborn, and he still refused to let the people bounce."
Exodus,9,8,"So, God was like, 'Hey Moses and Aaron, grab some ashes from the furnace and have Moses sprinkle it toward the sky in front of Pharaoh.'"
Exodus,9,9,"And like, Egypt is gonna be covered in this super tiny dust that's gonna cause like these nasty boils and blisters to appear on people and animals all over the place, throughout the whole land of Egypt."
Exodus,9,10,"They grabbed some ashes from the furnace and stood in front of Pharaoh. Then Moses sprinkled it up towards the sky, and boom, everything started breaking out in gnarly boils on people and animals alike."
Exodus,9,11,"So, like, the magicians couldn't even handle Moses, man! They were totally covered in gross boils, just like all the other Egyptians."
Exodus,9,12,"So, like, God totally made Pharaoh's heart stubborn, and he, like, didn't listen to Moses and them, just as God said, you know?"
Exodus,9,13,"So like, God was straight up talking to Moses and was all like, 'Dude, wake up early in the morning and go stand in front of Pharaoh. Then say to him, 'Yo, this is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, is saying: Let my people bounce so they can worship me.'"
Exodus,9,14,"Because I'm about to unleash all my epic disasters on you, your crew, and your peeps. Just so you realize that there's no one cooler than me in the entire world."
Exodus,9,15,"Yo, I'm about to flex and bring down some serious fire! Gonna hit you and your squad with sick plagues, and you'll be wiped off the face of the earth."
Exodus,9,16,"And for real, I deliberately brought you into existence to flex my strength through you and make sure everyone knows my name all over the world. (Btw, when it says 'raised', it means like, 'made you stand'.)"
Exodus,9,17,"Why are you still acting all high and mighty, refusing to let my people go?"
Exodus,9,18,"Yo, listen up! Tomorrow, at this exact time, I'm gonna make it rain super intense hail, like nothing Egypt has ever seen before, not even since the beginning!"
Exodus,9,19,"So, like, go and gather all your animals and stuff that you have in the field. If you don't bring them home, then hail will come down on them and they'll, like, die and stuff."
Exodus,9,20,"The dude who respected the word of the LORD, like, totally made his servants and his animals bounce into the houses, man:"
Exodus,9,21,"And anyone who didn't pay attention to what the LORD said, well, they just left their peeps and their animals out in the field. #oops #shouldhavebeenlistening"
Exodus,9,22,"And God was like, 'Yo Moses, raise your hand up to the sky so there can be massive hail all over Egypt. It's gonna hit people, animals, and every single plant in the whole land, bro.'"
Exodus,9,23,"So Moses like, straight up lifted his staff towards the sky, and then BOOM, the LORD sent some major thunder and hail, with fire blazing on the ground too. And yep, the LORD made it rain hail like crazy all over Egypt."
Exodus,9,24,"It was wild, guys! There was this crazy storm with hail and fire mixed in, like the gnarliest combo ever. Seriously, nothing like it had ever happened in Egypt before. Absolute madness, man!"
Exodus,9,25,"So like, this super intense hailstorm hit Egypt and wrecked everything in sight - plants, trees, and even people and animals out in the open. It was really wild, man."
Exodus,9,26,"In the Goshen region, where the Israelite fam were, there wasn't any mad hailstorm goin' on."
Exodus,9,27,"So Pharaoh hit them up, and was like, 'Yo, Moses and Aaron, I messed up big time. The big man upstairs is totally in the right, and me and my crew are wicked, no cap.'"
Exodus,9,28,"Yo, like, ask the Lord (cuz seriously, it's getting old) to stop with all the booming thunder and hailstorms, and I'll give you the green light to bounce. No more delays, I promise. (Those thunder... things were intense, man!)"
Exodus,9,29,"Yo, Moses told him, once I dip out of the city, I'm gonna raise my hands up to the LORD and you'll see, the thunder will chill and there won't be any more hail. This is gonna prove to you that the earth belongs to the LORD."
Exodus,9,30,"But, like, I totally know that you and your squad aren't gonna be showing any respect to the LORD God just yet."
Exodus,9,31,"And like, dude, the flax and the barley got totally messed up, bro. 'Cause the barley was in that stage where it's all sprouted and the flax was flowering, man."
Exodus,9,32,"But the wheat and the rye were totally unharmed because they hadn't fully grown yet. They were still hidden, like in the dark."
Exodus,9,33,"So Moses left the city and approached the LORD, raising his hands up high. And then, like, the crazy thunderstorms and hail stopped, and no more rain fell on the ground."
Exodus,9,34,"And when Pharaoh peeped that the rain and the hail and the mega loud thunders were done, he like, totally sinned even harder, and straight up toughened his heart, along with his whole crew."
Exodus,9,35,"But like, Pharaoh's heart was all stubborn and stuff, and he was like, 'No way, I'm not letting the Israelite kids go!' Just as the LORD had said through Moses, you know?"
Exodus,10,1,"And God was like, yo Moses, go talk to Pharaoh, 'cause I made him and his squad stubborn on purpose, so I can flex my miracles in front of him, you know?"
Exodus,10,2,"So you can pass on the story to your kid and your grandkid and let them know all the epic stuff I did in Egypt, the mind-blowing miracles I performed. It's all to show you that I'm the ultimate boss, the LORD."
Exodus,10,3,"So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and told him, like, the LORD God of the Hebrews is like, 'Dude, how much longer are you gonna keep being all stubborn and not show some respect? Just let my people go, so they can do their thing and serve me, ya feel?"
Exodus,10,4,"Yo, if you keep frontin' and won't let my squad bounce, check it, tomorrow I'm unleashing swarms of locusts straight to your turf."
Exodus,10,5,"So basically, they're gonna be all over the place, like you won't even be able to see the ground. And they'll chow down on whatever's left after the crazy hailstorm, including all the trees in your fields. (FYI, 'face' in Hebrew means 'eye')"
Exodus,10,6,"And they'll totally pack your crib, and your servants' cribs, and all the cribs in Egypt, mate. Like, this is legit stuff that not even your oldies or their oldies have ever witnessed, from back in the day till now. And then he bailed on Pharaoh, just like that."
Exodus,10,7,"Pharaoh's squad was like, yo, how much longer we gonna let this dude mess with us? Let the homies bounce and do their thing for the LORD their God. Don't you realize that Egypt is already wrecked?"
Exodus,10,8,"So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he told them, 'Okay, go and worship the LORD your God. But tell me, who exactly is going? Like, who's in the squad?'"
Exodus,10,9,"So Moses was like, 'Yo, everyone's coming on this trip. Young, old, sons, daughters, flocks, herds - we're all going! Gotta throw a lit feast for the LORD.'"
Exodus,10,10,"And he was like, 'May the LORD be with you all, just as I'll let you and your little ones go. Be careful though, because danger is right in front of you.'"
Exodus,10,11,"Nah, it's all good. You guys should just bounce and do your thing for the LORD, like you wanted to. Then Pharaoh straight up kicked them out of his crib."
Exodus,10,12,"So God said to Moses, yo dude, reach out your hand over Egypt, 'cause we 'bout to bring some locusts up in here. They gonna munch on all the plants that got left by the hail, no chill."
Exodus,10,13,"So Moses whipped out his staff and held it up in Egypt, and the LORD brought a sick east wind that lasted the entire day and night. And when morning came, the east wind brought in a swarm of locusts!"
Exodus,10,14,"And so, like, these locusts straight up covered all of Egypt and like, they chilled out all over the place, man. It was, like, super intense; there had never been locusts like that before, and there won't be any like them ever again."
Exodus,10,15,"Like, they totally covered the whole earth and it got super dark because they ate up all the plants and fruits that were left after the hailstorm. Literally no green stuff was left on the trees or in the fields throughout the entire land of Egypt."
Exodus,10,16,"So Pharaoh was like, 'Yo Moses and Aaron, come here ASAP!' And he was like, 'Guys, I totally messed up big time. I sinned against the LORD your God and against you.'"
Exodus,10,17,"So, like, I really messed up this one time, but can you, like, ask God to forgive me and just, like, remove this punishment of death?"
Exodus,10,18,So he bounced outta Pharaoh's presence and straight-up pleaded with the LORD.
Exodus,10,19,"Then God totally unleashed a sick strong west wind that straight up yeeted the locusts and chucked them into the Red Sea, leaving zero locusts anywhere in Egypt. Not a single one, fam!"
Exodus,10,20,"But like, God totally made Pharaoh's heart super stubborn, so he wouldn't even let the Israelite squad bounce."
Exodus,10,21,"And God was like, 'Yo Moses, raise your hand towards the sky so that darkness can cover all of Egypt. And it's gonna be, like, super intense darkness, you can legit feel it, you know? Like, it's gonna be next level darkness.'"
Exodus,10,22,"So Moses, like, raised his hand to the sky, and then like, a super intense darkness covered the whole land of Egypt for three whole days, man:"
Exodus,10,23,"They didn't even see each other, or leave their spots for three whole days. But all the peeps of Israel had mad light in their cribz."
Exodus,10,24,"So Pharaoh hit up Moses and was like, 'Yo, go do your thing and worship the LORD, but keep your animals in check and don't forget to bring your little ones with you.'"
Exodus,10,25,"Moses was like, yo, we need some sacrifices and burnt offerings so we can worship the LORD our God. It's essential, you know? Like, hook us up with that. {us: Heb. into our hands}"
Exodus,10,26,"Our cows are coming along too, none of them are staying behind, 'cause we gotta bring 'em to serve the Lord our God. And we have no clue what else we're gonna need to serve the Lord until we get there."
Exodus,10,27,"But God, like, totally made Pharaoh's heart super stubborn, so he straight up refused to let the people go."
Exodus,10,28,"Pharaoh was like, 'Yo, get outta my sight and don't ever come back! If you show your face around here again, you're gonna be toast.'"
Exodus,10,29,"And Moses was like, 'Yo, you got some good points there. I'm outta here, won't be seeing your face again'."
Exodus,11,1,"And God was like, 'Yo Moses, I got one more big bad thing coming for Pharaoh and Egypt. After that, he's definitely gonna let you all bounce. And when he finally lets y'all go, he's gonna straight up kick y'all out for real.'"
Exodus,11,2,"Yo, listen up fam! Go tell everyone to ask their homies for some bling, both the guys and the girls, like silver and gold jewelry."
Exodus,11,3,"God made the Egyptians really like the Israelites. And Moses was super popular in Egypt, everyone loved him, even the Pharaoh's servants and the regular people."
Exodus,11,4,"Yo, Moses was like, listen up peeps! The LORD has spoken and he's like, around midnight, I'm gonna make a grand exit right in the heart of Egypt, you know?"
Exodus,11,5,"Yo, listen up! In Egypt, all the oldest peeps, from the main homie Pharaoh's firstborn to the firstborn of even the lowest servants, gonna pass away. And don't forget, even the firstborn animals ain't spared."
Exodus,11,6,"And there's gonna be, like, a huge cry all over Egypt, like, totally unprecedented, never gonna happen again."
Exodus,11,7,"But no dog will even bark at any of the Israelites, whether they are human or animal. This is so you'll understand that the LORD sets the Egyptians and Israelites apart from each other."
Exodus,11,8,"And all your homies will come to me and show me respect, saying, Peacee out, take all your followers with you.' And then I'll bounce. And he left Pharaoh, mad as hell."
Exodus,11,9,"And God was like, 'Yo Moses, just so you know, Pharaoh ain't gonna listen to you. I'm just tryna flex my mad miracles all over Egypt'."
Exodus,11,10,"So like, Moses and Aaron totally pulled off all these mind-blowing miracles right in front of Pharaoh. But get this, the LORD made Pharaoh's heart super stubborn, like rock solid, so he wouldn't let the Israelite squad bounce outta his territory."
Exodus,12,1,"So, like, God straight up starts talking to Moses and Aaron while they're still in Egypt, and this is what He said:"
Exodus,12,2,"Yo fam, this month is gonna be the start of all months, like the OG month of the year, you know what I'm sayin'?"
Exodus,12,3,"Yo, tell all the Israel peeps this: On the tenth day of this month, each bro gotta snatch a lamb for his crib, depending on his fam lineage. One lamb per fam, ya dig? (Lamb can also mean a kid, FYI)"
Exodus,12,4,"If there aren't enough people in the house to finish off the lamb, let the guy and his next door friend team up and split it based on everyone's appetite. Each person should eat their fair share of the lamb."
Exodus,12,5,"Make sure your lamb is absolutely flawless, a young male that's only a year old. Whether from the sheep or the goats, take it out for the sacrifice."
Exodus,12,6,And you gotta keep it going until the fourteenth day of that same month: and the whole squad of Israel peeps gonna slay it in the evening. {in...: Heb. between the two evenings}
Exodus,12,7,"And they gotta take some of the blood and smack it on the two side posts and on top of the door frame of the houses, where they gonna chow down."
Exodus,12,8,"And they gotta chow down on that meat, cooked up with some fire, and have it with some unleavened bread; and don't forget the bitter herbs, they gotta eat it all together."
Exodus,12,9,"Don't eat it raw or boiled with water, but grill it up! Cook the whole thing - head, legs, and all the guts."
Exodus,12,10,"And don't leave anything behind until morning; whatever's left, you gotta burn it up with fire before morning hits."
Exodus,12,11,"So, like, here's how you should eat it: be ready to go, with your jeans on and your favorite kicks, and hold your phone in one hand ready to leave quickly, okay? Don't waste time, it's the LORD'S passover vibes."
Exodus,12,12,"Yo, tonight I'm gonna roll through Egypt and teach them a lesson. I'm gonna take out all the firstborn, no matter if they're human or animal. And guess what? I'm not just gonna mess with the people, but I'm also gonna show those Egyptian gods who's boss. It's time for some serious judgment, and let me tell you, I'm the LORD, so I call the shots. (Or should I say, the princes?)"
Exodus,12,13,"And the blood will be like a signal on the houses where you {are}: and when I see the blood, I'll skip over you, and the plague won't come to wreck you when I strike Egypt. {to destroy...: Heb. for a destruction}"
Exodus,12,14,"So, like, this day is gonna be super memorable and you gotta celebrate it as a lit feast for the LORD throughout all your future generations. It's gonna be a never-ending celebration, like an epic tradition that never goes out of style."
Exodus,12,15,"Yo, for a whole week, y'all better be chowing down on that flatbread, no yeast allowed! Just make sure to ditch any leavening in your crib on day one. 'Cause if anyone dares to munch on that leavened bread from day one all the way 'til day seven, they gonna be straight up exiled from the Israel fam."
Exodus,12,16,"On the first day, there's gonna be a super chill gathering, and on the seventh day, there's gonna be another super chill gathering for you. You gotta take a break from work on those days, except for getting your grub on, that's totally cool and necessary. (btw, mann' means soull' in Hebrew)"
Exodus,12,17,"And you gotta celebrate the unleavened bread feast, 'cause on this exact day, I saved your crew from Egypt. So, make sure y'all keep on celebrating this day for all future generations, 'cause it's gonna be a forever tradition."
Exodus,12,18,"On the first {month}, on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening, you gotta chow down on some unleavened bread till the twenty-first day of the month in the evening."
Exodus,12,19,"For a whole week, you gotta make sure there's no leaven in your crib. 'Cause anyone who eats leavened stuff gonna be straight-up banned from the Israel fam, whether they're new in town or OG native."
Exodus,12,20,"Don't chow down on anything leavened! Only munch on that unleavened bread, no matter where you're at."
Exodus,12,21,"So Moses gathered all the OGs of Israel and was like, yo, get a lamb or a kid if you prefer, for each of your fams, and go slay that passover sacrifice."
Exodus,12,22,"And you gotta grab some hyssop and dip it in the blood in the bowl, then go ahead and sprinkle the blood on the doorway and the side posts. And nobody can leave their crib until the next morning."
Exodus,12,23,"Yo, the LORD gonna straight up come through and wreck those Egyptians. But when He peeps the blood on the doorframe and the two side panels, He gonna pass right over that door, not letting the destroyer come in to wreck your houses and mess with y'all."
Exodus,12,24,"And you gotta keep doing this thing, like, forever, both for yourself and for your future kids, okay?"
Exodus,12,25,"And, like, when you finally reach the land that the LORD is hooking you up with, just as he promised, you gotta keep doing this whole service thing, ya know?"
Exodus,12,26,"So, like, one day when your kids are all like, 'Yo, what's the deal with this whole service thing?'"
Exodus,12,27,"So you gotta be like, 'Yo, this is the lit sacrifice for the LORD'S passover, when He flexed and passed over the houses of the fam Israel in Egypt. He straight up clapped the Egyptians and saved our crib. And the whole fam showed respect and worshiped."
Exodus,12,28,"So, like, the Israelites bounced and totally followed the instructions from the LORD that Moses and Aaron had passed on to them. They were totally obedient, no doubt!"
Exodus,12,29,"So, like, this totally happened, bro: In the middle of the night, the LORD totally went all supernatural and struck down every firstborn in the land of Egypt. Yeah, from the super important firstborn son of Pharaoh all the way down to the firstborn prisoner stuck in the dungeon, and even the firstborn animals got affected, man. (BTW, dungeon means like, house of the pit in case you didn't know)"
Exodus,12,30,"Then Pharaoh and all his peeps, along with everyone in Egypt, panicked real hard in the middle of the night. It was a total freakout, yo! There wasn't a single crib in the whole place where someone didn't end up biting the dust."
Exodus,12,31,"So, like, God summonsed Moses and Aaron in the middle of the night and was all like, 'Yo, get up and get outta here with the people of Israel. Go serve the LORD, just like you said you would.'"
Exodus,12,32,"Yo, grab your homies and all your animals like you said, dip out of here, and show some love by blessing me too."
Exodus,12,33,The Egyptians were totally pressuring everyone to leave the land ASAP because they thought we were all gonna kick the bucket.
Exodus,12,34,"So, like, the people snagged their dough before it had time to rise, and they wrapped up their kneading tools in their clothes and carried them on their shoulders. You know, just sayin', 'kneadingtroughs' is another word for dough, if you catch my drift."
Exodus,12,35,"So, like, the Israelites totally listened to Moses, right? And they just straight up asked the Egyptians for all their fancy bling - you know, silver and gold jewels, and even some stylish clothes!"
Exodus,12,36,"And the Lord made the Egyptians think the Israelites were pretty cool, so the Egyptians totally hooked them up with whatever they needed. And guess what? The Israelites ended up taking a bunch of stuff from the Egyptians."
Exodus,12,37,"And the fam of Israel bounced from Rameses to Succoth, with like 600k dudes on foot, not counting the kiddos."
Exodus,12,38,"And, like, a bunch of different people went with them, and they brought along a ton of animals, like, a ridiculous amount of cows and stuff."
Exodus,12,39,"So, they made some plain cakes from the dough they brought from Egypt. They didn't add any yeast because they had to hurry and leave Egypt, and they didn't have time to prepare any proper food."
Exodus,12,40,"So, like, the Israelite squad, right, they were chillin' in Egypt for a solid four hundred and thirty years."
Exodus,12,41,"And after waiting for a long, long time, exactly four hundred and thirty years to be precise, it finally happened! On that very day, all the squads of the LORD dipped out of Egypt like peace out, homies!"
Exodus,12,42,"Yo, this is a lit night to remember for the LORD 'cause He brought the Israelites outta Egypt. Like, it's THE night for all future generations of the children of Israel to celebrate and remember. #NightOfObservation"
Exodus,12,43,"And God was like, yo Moses and Aaron, this is the rule for Passover: No random person can grub on that feast:"
Exodus,12,44,"But, like, if you purchase a servant with cash, ya know, and then you, like, go and circumcise him, well, then he can, uh, totally have a bite of it."
Exodus,12,45,"Don't let any outsiders or hired help chow down on it, okay?"
Exodus,12,46,"You gotta chow down on that food all in one crib, don't take any of that meat outside the house, and make sure you keep those bones intact, no flexin'."
Exodus,12,47,"Everybody in the Israel crew gotta keep it. {keep...: Like, actually do it}"
Exodus,12,48,"If someone new comes to chill with you and wants to celebrate Passover, make sure all the dudes get circumcised first, then they can join in. Treat them like they're one of the homies from the land, because only the circumcised ones can feast on it."
Exodus,12,49,"Everyone, whether they're a local or visitor, abides by the same rules."
Exodus,12,50,"And all the Israelite fam did exactly as the LORD told Moses and Aaron, no questions asked."
Exodus,12,51,"And on that very day, the LORD led the cool peeps of Israel out of Egypt with their squads."
Exodus,13,1,"And God spoke to Moses, like, dude, listen up,"
Exodus,13,2,"Yo, set apart for me all the firstborn, no matter if they be human or animal, from the children of Israel. They belong to me, straight up."
Exodus,13,3,"Yo, listen up fam! Moses was like, yo peeps, never forget this day when we totally bounced outta Egypt, straight outta enslavement! Like, the Lord totally flexed his power and saved us from that {place}, so we gotta ditch the leavened bread. No more of that, aight? {bondage: Hebrew for servants, FYI}"
Exodus,13,4,"Yo fam, today is the day you dipped out in the month called Abib."
Exodus,13,5,"And when the LORD takes you to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites, just like he promised your ancestors, a place that's all abundant and awesome, make sure you celebrate this occasion every year."
Exodus,13,6,"For a whole week, you gotta stick to unleavened bread, and on the seventh day, it's time to throw down and celebrate for the LORD."
Exodus,13,7,"You gotta eat that unleavened bread for a whole week, and don't even think about having any leavened bread around. No leaven allowed anywhere in your crib."
Exodus,13,8,"And on that day, you gotta tell your kid like, 'Yo, this happened 'cause the LORD straight up saved me when I peaced out of Egypt.'"
Exodus,13,9,"And this is gonna be like a cool accessory on your hand, and like a dope reminder right between your eyes, so that you always keep God's law on your lips, 'cause you know, the Lord totally flexed and rescued you from Egypt with some serious power moves."
Exodus,13,10,So make sure to keep following this tradition every year at the right time.
Exodus,13,11,"And when the LORD takes you to the Canaanites' land, just like he promised to you and your ancestors, and gives it to you,"
Exodus,13,12,"You gotta dedicate anything that's the firstborn or opens the womb to the LORD, whether it's a person or an animal. The dudes belong to the LORD."
Exodus,13,13,"So, like, if your firstborn donkey happens, you know, you gotta trade it for a lamb. And if you're not down with that, then you gotta break its neck, bro. Oh, and by the way, any firstborn human in your fam, you gotta redeem them too. Just a heads up, you can also replace 'lamb' with 'kid' if you're into that."
Exodus,13,14,"And when your kid asks you in the future like, 'Yo, what's up with this?' you gotta tell them, 'Yo, the LORD straight up flexed His power and got us outta Egypt, where we were all trapped, you feel? Like, that's how it went down, fam. Tomorrow is another day, just so you know.'"
Exodus,13,15,"So, like, when Pharaoh was being super stubborn about letting us leave, the LORD went ahead and took out all the firstborn in Egypt, both peeps and animals. That's why I make sacrifices to the LORD with all the male animals that are born first. But when it comes to my own kids, I redeem them instead."
Exodus,13,16,"And wear it as a symbol on your hand and between your eyebrows, to always remember that the Lord rescued us from Egypt through His awesome power."
Exodus,13,17,"So, like, when Pharaoh finally let the peeps go, God didn't lead them through the land of the Philistines, even though it was, like, closer and stuff. 'Cause God was like, 'Maybe if they see some war action, they'll freak out and want to go back to Egypt, you know?'"
Exodus,13,18,"But God guided the peeps, like, on this wild journey through the wilderness by the Red Sea and the Israelites went all decked out, like, five in a row, as they left Egypt. You know, they were organized and ready to go."
Exodus,13,19,"So Moses grabbed Joseph's bones because he had made a serious promise to the Israelites. He said, 'Don't worry, God's got your back. And when you bounce from this place, make sure my bones come along too.'"
Exodus,13,20,"Then they left Succoth and set up camp in Etham, right on the edge of the wilderness."
Exodus,13,21,"And God was there for them, guiding their path during the day with a rad cloud, and lighting up their nights with a lit fire, so they could travel both day and night."
Exodus,13,22,He didn't get rid of the sick clouds during the day or the lit fires at night in front of the crowd.
Exodus,14,1,"Yo, God hit up Moses and was like,"
Exodus,14,2,"Yo, tell the Israel fam to turn up and chill near Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, in front of Baalzephon. They gotta camp right by the sea, no doubt."
Exodus,14,3,"Pharaoh gonna be like, 'Yo, those Israel kids stuck up in this place, the wildness got 'em trapped'."
Exodus,14,4,"I'm gonna make Pharaoh stubborn so he'll chase after them. And I'll show off my power to Pharaoh and his crew, just so the Egyptians can see that I'm the big boss. And, yup, that's exactly what happened."
Exodus,14,5,"So, like, word got to the king of Egypt that the people bounced, and Pharaoh and his squad got all mad and started hating on the people. They were like, 'Why did we let Israel go? What were we thinking?'"
Exodus,14,6,Then he got his whip and gathered his squad:
Exodus,14,7,"And he flexed with six hundred epic chariots, and snagged all the sick chariots of Egypt, with captains slaying the game on each one of them."
Exodus,14,8,"And God made Pharaoh king of Egypt stubborn, and he went after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel left confidently."
Exodus,14,9,"So, like, the Egyptians totally went after them, with all their horses and chariots and stuff, along with their horsemen and their whole army, and caught up with them at the sea, near this place called Pihahiroth, just before Baalzephon."
Exodus,14,10,"So Pharaoh came closer, and the Israelites looked up and saw the Egyptians marching behind them. They were really scared and started crying out to the LORD."
Exodus,14,11,"Yo, they were like, Mosess, seriously?! Were there not enough graves in Egypt? Did you really bring us out here in the wilderness just to die? Why you gotta do us like that and take us out of Egypt?'"
Exodus,14,12,"Hey, remember when we told you back in Egypt to leave us alone so we could just serve the Egyptians? We thought it would be better to be their servants than to die out here in the wilderness."
Exodus,14,13,"And Moses was like, 'Hey, don't even trip, you guys! Just chill out and watch as the LORD saves us today. Like, seriously, you won't even see those Egyptians again, ever. It's gonna be lit!'"
Exodus,14,14,"God's got your back, so chillax and let Him handle it."
Exodus,14,15,"God was like, yo Moses, why you crying out to me? Instead, talk to the Israelite squad and tell 'em to keep it moving: forward!"
Exodus,14,16,"Okay, so here's the game plan: take your rod, flex it up and extend your hand over the sea, like you're about to drop a sick beat. Then watch the magic happen as the sea splits into two, creating a rad pathway for the kids of Israel to strut their stuff on dry ground, right through the middle of the sea."
Exodus,14,17,"So, get this, I'm gonna make the Egyptians' hearts super stubborn, and they're gonna chase after the Israelites. And here's the best part: I'm gonna totally flex on Pharaoh and his crew, including his sick chariots and epic horsemen. It's gonna be legendary!"
Exodus,14,18,"And all those Egyptians will realize that I am the LORD, once I show my power over Pharaoh, his cool chariots, and his squad of horsemen."
Exodus,14,19,"So, like, this angel from God, who was leading the Israel peeps, bounced to the back and started following them. And you won't believe it, but the cloud thingy that was guiding them, it moved from in front of them and stood behind them. Crazy, right?"
Exodus,14,20,"So this big cloud thing appeared between the Egyptian camp and the Israelite camp. It was all dark and spooky for the Egyptians, but for the Israelites, it actually lit up the night. This crazy cloud kept the Egyptians and Israelites separate all through the night, so there was no chance of them getting close to each other."
Exodus,14,21,"So Moses totally raised his hand and flexed it over the sea, and then the LORD was like, 'Yo, I got this!' He made this epic strong wind blow all night from the east, and guess what? It actually made the sea pull a reverse Uno card, transforming it into solid ground and splitting the waters in half. Talk about a total power move!"
Exodus,14,22,"So, like, the Israelites totally walked through the sea on this, like, super dry ground! And get this - the water, it was like a wall on their right and left. How epic is that?!"
Exodus,14,23,"So like, the Egyptians were totally chasing after them, and they even went into the sea with all of Pharaoh's horses, chariots, and horsemen."
Exodus,14,24,"Then, like, in the early morning, the LORD peeped on the Egyptian crew through the fire and cloud thingy, and totally wrecked them."
Exodus,14,25,"And they popped the wheels off their fancy chariots, causing them to move painfully slow. The Egyptians were like, 'Yo, let's bounce and run away from Israel because the Lord is totally backing them up, fighting against us.'"
Exodus,14,26,"So, God said to Moses, yo dude, extend your hand over the sea and let the water come back, totally drenching those Egyptians, their fancy chariots, and those horse dudes."
Exodus,14,27,"So Moses straight-up extended his hand over the sea, and when morning arrived, the sea was like, 'I'm back, baby!' And the Egyptians were like, Peacee, I'm out!' But then the LORD straight-up wrecked the Egyptians right in the middle of the sea. {overthrew: Like, shook off}"
Exodus,14,28,"Then the water came back and totally wrecked the chariots, and the horse guys, and all of Pharaoh's squad that followed them into the sea; not a single one of them made it out alive."
Exodus,14,29,"So, the Israelites straight up walked on dry ground through the middle of the sea, fam. The water was like a solid wall on their right and left, keeping them safe and sound."
Exodus,14,30,"So, like, God totally saved Israel from the Egyptians on that epic day, and when Israel looked, they saw those Egyptians lying dead on the beach by the sea. It was crazy!"
Exodus,14,31,And Israel saw how epic the LORD's moves were against the Egyptians. The people were shook and had mad respect for the LORD and straight up believed in the LORD and his homeboy Moses. #miraclehands
Exodus,15,1,"So Moses and the squad of Israel straight up dropped this fire song for the LORD, and they were like, 'Yo, I'ma sing for the LORD 'cause He straight up smashed it! Like, He totally wiped out the horse and its rider straight into the sea!'"
Exodus,15,2,"GOD is like, my ultimate power and jam, you know? He's, like, totally saved me and stuff. He's my homie, my ride or die, you feel me? And I'm gonna hook Him up with a sweet spot to chill. He's my OG, my numero uno, and I'm gonna give Him all the props."
Exodus,15,3,"Yo, the LORD is like a total warrior, man! His name is the LORD, no cap."
Exodus,15,4,"Yo, God straight up yeeted Pharaoh's whips and his whole crew into the sea. Even their top dogs got dunked in the Red sea."
Exodus,15,5,"They got totally covered and went straight to the depths, sinking like a stone to the bottom."
Exodus,15,6,"God, your right hand is flexing with power, totally obliterating the enemy."
Exodus,15,7,"And when you flexed your absolute greatness, you totally wrecked those haters who tried to come at you. You unleashed your furious anger, obliterating them like they were nothing but dry grass on a summer day."
Exodus,15,8,"And, like, your breath caused the waters to come together, the floods stood up in a big pile, and the deep parts of the sea froze."
Exodus,15,9,"The hater was like, 'I'm gonna chase after them, catch up to them, and snatch their goods. I'm gonna get what I want, and I'll even whip out my sword and obliterate them with my own hand.'"
Exodus,15,10,You like totally used your cool wind and the sea was all like whoosh and covered them: they sank like heavy metal in the mega waters.
Exodus,15,11,"Yo, who even compares to You, LORD? Like seriously, no one can match Your glory, Your holiness, and the way You rock our world with amazing miracles. I mean, talk about setting the bar high! No other gods even come close, ya feel?!"
Exodus,15,12,"You like totally extended your right hand, and the earth just like swallowed them up."
Exodus,15,13,"You, in your kindness, have led the people you have saved. You have guided them with your power to your sacred dwelling place."
Exodus,15,14,"When the peeps hear it, they'll be shook: sadness will grip the folks in Palestina."
Exodus,15,15,"Yo, the Edom dudes gonna be shook; the Moab bad boys gonna be trembling like crazy; everyone in Canaan gonna be straight up melting."
Exodus,15,16,"They're gonna be freaking out and totally shook when they see how powerful you are, like frozen in place. You're gonna keep them motionless until your people can cross over, Lord, the ones you've totally bought and saved."
Exodus,15,17,"You gotta take them in and plant them in the dope mountain that's all yours, where you wanna chill, in your holy crib that you built with your hands, Lord."
Exodus,15,18,"God's gonna be in charge forever and ever, no cap."
Exodus,15,19,"So like, Pharaoh's whole squad of horses and chariots rolled into the sea, with all the horsemen and stuff. And then, God made the sea go wild and the water came crashing down on them. But the Israelites, man, they straight up walked right through the sea on dry land. No getting wet or nada."
Exodus,15,20,"And Miriam, the OG prophetess, who happens to be Aaron's sister, grabbed a sick timbrel and led a lit female squad out there, with timbrels and busting out moves."
Exodus,15,21,"Miriam was like, 'Yo, sing your hearts out to the LORD! He totally crushed it and made those horses and their riders drown in the sea.'"
Exodus,15,22,"So Moses totally led the Israel fam away from the Red Sea and they ventured into this wild place called Shur; and they were trekking through the wilderness for like three whole days, and man, they couldn't find any water anywhere. It was a serious struggle, dude."
Exodus,15,23,"So they arrived at Marah, but the water there was, like, super undrinkable, too bitter to handle. That's why they ended up naming the place Marah, which basically means bitterness."
Exodus,15,24,"The peeps were like, Moses, seriously? How we gonna hydrate tho?"
Exodus,15,25,"And he was like, OMG, he called out to the LORD and the LORD was like, 'I gotchu!' He showed him this lit tree, and when he threw it into the water, the water became all sweet and refreshing. Then, right there, he established some cool rules and regulations for them, and also like, tested them, you know?"
Exodus,15,26,"And like, listen up! If you really pay attention to what the LORD your God is saying, and you do what's right in His eyes, and you obey His commandments and keep all His rules, then you won't have to deal with any of the diseases that the Egyptians had to face. Because, y'know, I'm the LORD, the one who heals you and stuff."
Exodus,15,27,"So they arrived at Elim, which had like, twelve water wells and seventy palm trees, and they set up camp there by the water."
Exodus,16,1,"So, they packed up and left Elim, and all the Israelites headed to the wilderness of Sin. It's like this spot between Elim and Sinai. They arrived there on the fifteenth day of the second month after leaving Egypt."
Exodus,16,2,"So, basically all the kids of Israel started complaining about Moses and Aaron while they were chilling in the wilderness:"
Exodus,16,3,"The Israelites were like, 'Ugh, we wish we had died back in Egypt, where we had all the good food and stuff. You just had to bring us out here to the wilderness to starve us all to death.'"
Exodus,16,4,"So, like, God was talking to Moses, right? And He was like, 'Yo Moses, check it out, I'm gonna make it rain bread from heaven for you and the peeps. But here's the deal, they gotta go out and gather just enough for each day. This way, I can test them and see if they'll follow my laws or not.'"
Exodus,16,5,"And like, listen up, on the sixth day, they gotta prep twice as much 'cause that's what they're gonna bring in, ya know? It's gonna be like double the amount of what they gather normally every day."
Exodus,16,6,"So Moses and Aaron were like, 'Yo, all you peeps of Israel, listen up! When the sun goes down, that's when you'll know for sure that the LORD has totally freed you from the clutches of Egypt."
Exodus,16,7,"And in the morning, y'all gonna witness the epicness of the LORD. Like seriously, He's listening to all your complaints and stuff. So, like, what's the deal? Why y'all murmuring against us? Who do y'all think we are?"
Exodus,16,8,"So Moses was like, God is gonna hook you up with some meat at night and bread in the morning, cause He knows y'all be complaining. But don't get it twisted, your complaints ain't about us, they're directed at the big man upstairs."
Exodus,16,9,"So, Moses talked to Aaron and was like, yo, go tell all the Israelite peeps to gather 'round before the LORD. 'Cause He's heard y'all complainin'."
Exodus,16,10,"So Aaron was like talking to all the kids of Israel, and they like turned their heads towards the wilderness, and boom, the epic glory of the LORD showed up in this cloud thing."
Exodus,16,11,"So, like, God started talking to Moses, and this is what He said,"
Exodus,16,12,"I caught wind of the gossip among the Israelite squad: tell them this, 'When night falls, you'll feast on some meat, and when morning comes, you won't go hungry because you'll have plenty of bread. And by that, you'll realize that I'm the boss, the LORD your God.'"
Exodus,16,13,"So like, when it got dark, all these quails showed up and totally covered the camp. And when morning came, there was dew everywhere around the whole crew."
Exodus,16,14,"And like, when the dew was all evaporated, yo, there it was, straight up in the wilderness, this like tiny round thing, hella small, just like the hoar frost on the ground."
Exodus,16,15,"And when the Israelites saw it, they were like, 'Whoa, dude, what is this stuff?'. And they were like, 'It's totally manna, bro!'. See, they had no clue what it was. So Moses was like, 'Yo, guys, this right here is the bread that the LORD has hooked you up with, so eat up!'."
Exodus,16,16,"Yo, this is what the LORD wants y'all to do: Gather up enough food for each person in your crew, one omer per person. Make sure you count everyone in your squad and snag enough for everyone in their own tents. Let's do this!"
Exodus,16,17,"So the Israelites did it, and they all collected different amounts, some more, some less."
Exodus,16,18,"And when they measured it with an omer, the one who gathered lots didn't have any extra, and the one who gathered little didn't go hungry; they each gathered according to what they needed to eat."
Exodus,16,19,"And Moses was like, yo, don't even think about saving any of that for tomorrow, fam."
Exodus,16,20,"But they didn't listen to Moses, and some of them didn't finish the food and kept it until the next morning. It got all gross and maggots started coming out of it, and Moses got super angry at them."
Exodus,16,21,"So like, they would pick it up every morning, each person getting enough for their meal, and like, when it got hot outside, it would just totally melt away."
Exodus,16,22,"So like, on the sixth day, they hauled in double the bread, two omers for each person. And all the big shots of the crew went up to Moses and spilled the tea."
Exodus,16,23,"And he was like, yo listen up, this is what the LORD has spoken. Tomorrow is the chill rest day, it's all about the holy sabbath for the LORD. So go ahead and bake whatever you wanna bake today and cook whatever you wanna cook. And if you have any leftovers, just save 'em for tomorrow morning, no biggie."
Exodus,16,24,"They left it until morning, just like Moses said, and it didn't smell bad or have any worms in it."
Exodus,16,25,"And Moses was like, yo, grab some grub today 'cause it's the Lord's chill day, fam. Ain't no food in the field today, so get it now."
Exodus,16,26,"You gotta collect that stuff for six straight days, but on the seventh day, AKA the sabbath, there's gonna be nothing available."
Exodus,16,27,"So, like, on the seventh day, some peeps went out to gather, but they couldn't find any."
Exodus,16,28,"And God was like, 'Yo Moses, seriously, how much longer are you gonna keep ignoring my commandments and laws?"
Exodus,16,29,"Yo, listen up! The big man upstairs, the LORD, hooked you up with the sabbath day. So on the sixth day, he's making sure you've got enough bread for two days. Here's the deal: everyone needs to stay put in their own spot on the seventh day, no one should be out and about."
Exodus,16,30,And then everyone just chilled out on the seventh day.
Exodus,16,31,"So the Israelites named it Manna: it looked like coriander seeds, white in color; and it tasted like honey-flavored wafers."
Exodus,16,32,"Moses was like, yo listen up fam, God wants us to save a portion of this stuff, like an omer, for the future peeps. It's gonna be a reminder of the bread that kept us alive when we were wanderin' in the wilderness, after we dipped outta Egypt."
Exodus,16,33,"Yo Aaron, grab a pot and fill it up with that fresh manna, then stash it before the LORD as a timeless keepsake for your fam."
Exodus,16,34,Aaron did what the LORD told Moses and placed it in front of the Testimony for safekeeping.
Exodus,16,35,"So, like, the Israel peeps had manna for a solid 40 years, until they finally reached a place with actual people. Manna was their jam, until they made it to the borders of Canaan, you know?"
Exodus,16,36,"So, like, an omer is, like, one-tenth of an ephah."
Exodus,17,1,"So, like, all the Israelites, they were all traveling together, right? They left this place called the wilderness of Sin, after going through a bunch of other places, because the LORD told them to. And then they stopped at this place called Rephidim, you know? But, uh-oh, there was no water for the people to drink! Can you believe that?"
Exodus,17,2,"So the people started complaining to Moses, saying, 'Yo, give us some water to drink.' And Moses was like, 'Why you all gotta be complaining to me? Why you tryna test the LORD?'"
Exodus,17,3,"So everyone was super thirsty and started complaining to Moses, like, 'Why'd you bring us out of Egypt if you're just gonna let us, our kids, and our animals die of thirst?"
Exodus,17,4,"So, Moses hit up the big man upstairs, like, 'Yo, what am I supposed to do with these people? They're about to straight up kill me.'"
Exodus,17,5,"Then God was like, 'Yo Moses, lead the way in front of the people. Grab some of the older peeps from Israel and don't forget that stick you used to hit the river. Hold onto it and start walking.'"
Exodus,17,6,"Yo, listen up! So basically, I'm gonna be chilling on this rock in Horeb, right in front of you. And all you gotta do is give that rock a good smack, and boom! Water will come gushing out of it, quenching the thirst of the people. And guess what? Moses totally pulled it off, with all the elders of Israel watching the whole spectacle go down."
Exodus,17,7,"So, he named that place Massah and Meribah, all because the Israelites were complaining and testing the Lord, questioning whether He was really with them or not. (Massah means 'Temptation' and Meribah means 'Chiding' or 'Strife')"
Exodus,17,8,"And then, Amalek showed up and started fighting with Israel in Rephidim."
Exodus,17,9,"And Moses was like, yo Joshua, pick some dudes and let's go battle Amalek. Tomorrow, I'ma be chilling on the hilltop, holding God's rod in my hand. (BTW, Joshua used to be called Jesus, just so you know)"
Exodus,17,10,"Joshua totally followed Moses' instructions and like, went to battle against Amalek. And Moses, Aaron, and Hur, they all went up to the top of the hill, you know?"
Exodus,17,11,"So like, when Moses lifted his hand up, Israel totally dominated, but when he put his hand down, Amalek took the lead."
Exodus,17,12,"Moses' hands were getting tired, so they grabbed a stone and made him sit on it. Aaron and Hur stood on either side, supporting his hands, and they didn't let them waver until the sun went down."
Exodus,17,13,So Joshua totally wrecked Amalek and his crew with some serious sword skills.
Exodus,17,14,"Yo, God was like, 'Yo, Moses, write this down in a book as a reminder and make sure Joshua hears it, 'cause I'm straight up gonna wipe out any memory of Amalek from the face of the earth.'"
Exodus,17,15,"So Moses totally set up this sick altar and was like, 'Yo, we calling this Jehovahnissi, which means, like, The LORD my banner'. Like, He's our ultimate squad leader, guiding us with His righteous vibes, you feel me?"
Exodus,17,16,"He's like, 'Yo, hear me out. The Lord totally swears that there's gonna be this epic war with Amalek, like, forever! Amalek's got beef with the Lord's throne, so it's on, dude!'"
Exodus,18,1,"When Jethro, the cool priest of Midian and Moses' father in law, heard about all the epic stuff God did for Moses and the Israel peeps, and how the LORD totally saved Israel from Egypt;"
Exodus,18,2,"So, like, Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought Zipporah, Moses' wife, back to him after Moses had sent her away."
Exodus,18,3,"And she had two sons; one of them was named Gershom, which means 'a stranger there,' because he said, 'I felt like an outsider in a foreign place.'"
Exodus,18,4,"And the other guy's name was Eliezer, because my dad's God totally had my back and saved me from Pharaoh's sword. Eliezer, like, means 'My God is an help', just so you know."
Exodus,18,5,"So Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, pulled up with his fam - sons and wife - to chill with Moses out in the wild, where he had set up camp at the mountain of God:"
Exodus,18,6,"And he was like, yo Moses, listen up. It's me, your father-in-law Jethro, sliding into your DMs. I just pulled up with your wife and her two sons, no cap."
Exodus,18,7,"So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, gave him a respectful greeting, and they exchanged greetings and asked about each other's well-being. Then they went into the tent to hang out."
Exodus,18,8,"So Moses was like, telling his father-in-law all about how the LORD totally wrecked Pharaoh and the Egyptians because of Israel, and all the crazy stuff they went through on their journey, and how the LORD miraculously saved them. It was real intense, man."
Exodus,18,9,"And Jethro was stoked AF for all the epic goodness that the LORD had done to Israel, like totally saving them from those crazy Egyptians! 🙌"
Exodus,18,10,"And Jethro was like, woah, shoutout to the Big Guy, the LORD, for saving you from those Egyptians and from Pharaoh, freeing the people from their grip."
Exodus,18,11,"Dude, I totally get it now. Like, the LORD is legit the biggest boss among all the gods. He totally outshines them with his rad attitude and way above their level of pride. Can't mess with that, man."
Exodus,18,12,"So Jethro, Moses' father in law, decided to have a little BBQ party for God. Aaron and all the cool elders of Israel showed up to chill and have some grub with Moses' father in law, all in the presence of God."
Exodus,18,13,"The next day, Moses started settling people's disputes. And all the people lined up to seek judgment from Moses, waiting all day long."
Exodus,18,14,"When Moses' father-in-law saw everything he was doing to the people, he was like, 'Bro, what's up with this? Why are you doing everything by yourself while everyone else is just waiting around all day? Like, seriously?'"
Exodus,18,15,"So Moses was like, yo, pops, these peeps keep coming to me with all their questions to seek advice from The Big Guy Upstairs:"
Exodus,18,16,"When they have a problem, they hit me up; and I'm out here settling disputes, making sure they're in the know about God's rules and laws. It's like being the official mediator, keeping things fair between them."
Exodus,18,17,"Yo, Moses' father-in-law was like, 'Bro, what you're doing ain't cool.'"
Exodus,18,18,"You're totally gonna burn out, both you, and everyone around you: 'cause this is way too much for you to handle on your own. You're not gonna be able to pull it off by yourself. (Yo, you're gonna fade away for real, fade away)"
Exodus,18,19,"Yo, listen up! I got some advice for you. God's got your back, so make sure you're representing the people in front of God. Bring their issues directly to Him, bro!"
Exodus,18,20,"And you gotta teach them all the rules and laws, and show them how to live their lives and the things they gotta do."
Exodus,18,21,"You gotta choose some capable dudes from the crowd, dudes who respect God and always keep it real, dudes who hate being greedy. And put them in charge as leaders of large groups, leaders of smaller groups, leaders of even smaller groups, and leaders of super tiny groups."
Exodus,18,22,"And let them be the ones to make decisions for the people all the time: big cases they should bring to you, but for the small stuff, they can handle it themselves. That way, you won't be so overwhelmed, and they'll help share the load with you."
Exodus,18,23,"If you do what God says and He's totally down with it, then you'll be able to handle it and all of your squad will be chill and go to their own turf without any drama."
Exodus,18,24,So Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said.
Exodus,18,25,"So Moses picked some really capable dudes from all over Israel and put them in charge as leaders. They were like head honchos, ruling over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens."
Exodus,18,26,"And they were like, constantly judging and stuff: the really complicated cases they took to Moses, but for every little thing they handled it themselves."
Exodus,18,27,So Moses said goodbye to his father-in-law and he went back home to his own land.
Exodus,19,1,"In like, the third month, after the kiddos of Israel dipped out of Egypt, they straight up landed in the middle of nowhere, Sinai fam."
Exodus,19,2,"So they left Rephidim and arrived at the desert of Sinai. They set up camp in the middle of nowhere, and that's where Israel stayed, right in front of the mountain."
Exodus,19,3,"So Moses went up to talk with God, and the LORD called out to him from the mountain. He said, 'Hey, here's what you gotta tell the house of Jacob and the children of Israel:'"
Exodus,19,4,"Y'all saw the epic stuff I pulled off with the Egyptians, and how I totally carried you like a boss on eagles' wings to bring you closer to me."
Exodus,19,5,"So, like, if you truly listen to me and follow my rules, you'll be, like, so special to me, better than anyone else. 'Cause, honestly, the whole earth is mine, you know?"
Exodus,19,6,And you guys will be like a kingdom of priests and a super holy group. These are the words that you should totally say to the children of Israel.
Exodus,19,7,"So Moses like, showed up and gathered all the older dudes of the crew, and straight up spilled all the words that the LORD told him, right in front of them."
Exodus,19,8,"And everyone was like, 'Yeah, we're totally down with everything the LORD said, we'll do it all.' Then Moses was like, Wordd!' and told the LORD what the people said."
Exodus,19,9,"God was like, 'Yo, Moses! I'mma roll through in a dope cloud so the whole squad can hear me when I talk to you and have faith in what you say, 100%. Then Moses went and relayed all the peeps' words to God."
Exodus,19,10,"God was like, yo Moses, go talk to the peeps and tell 'em to get cleaned up today and tomorrow by washing their clothes."
Exodus,19,11,Get ready for the third day because that's when the LORD is gonna roll up on Mount Sinai and everybody's gonna see it go down.
Exodus,19,12,"Yo, make sure you all stay in your own zone. Don't even think about stepping foot on that mountain or getting too close to it. Anybody who does will straight up get executed, no questions asked."
Exodus,19,13,"No one better lay a finger on it, or they're gonna get stoned or shot, whether they're an animal or a human! They ain't gonna survive! When that trumpet makes a long sound, everyone better come up to the mountain. (BTW, trumpet can mean cornet too, if you didn't know!)"
Exodus,19,14,"So Moses came down from the mountain to the peeps, and made them all holy and stuff; and they cleaned their fits."
Exodus,19,15,"And he said to the squad, Get yourselves together by the third day: no flexing on your partners, bro."
Exodus,19,16,"So, like, after three days in the morning, there were mad thunders, lightnings, and a super thick cloud on the mountain. And the sound of the trumpet was crazy loud, causing everyone in the camp to freak out."
Exodus,19,17,"So Moses took the people out of the camp to meet up with God, and they all gathered at the foot of the mountain."
Exodus,19,18,"So like, Mount Sinai was, like, totally covered in smoke because, you know, the LORD came down on it in like, fire. And the smoke, it was going up just, you know, like a big furnace and the whole mountain was, like, shaking like crazy."
Exodus,19,19,"When the trumpet's sound was blastin' loud, gettin' louder and louder, Moses spoke up and God answered him with a voice."
Exodus,19,20,"So, God totally appeared on Mount Sinai, right at the tip-top of the mountain. And He called Moses to come up there and Moses was like, 'Sure thing!' and went all the way up."
Exodus,19,21,"Yo, Moses, listen up. The LORD told him to go down and warn the people not to get too close to the LORD, otherwise they might straight up die. (charge here means to like, seriously contest or challenge Him)"
Exodus,19,22,"Yo, the priests gotta make sure they're all clean and pure before they get close to the LORD, otherwise His wrath might just come down on them."
Exodus,19,23,"So, Moses was like, 'Yo, God, the people can't go up Mount Sinai. You told us to put boundaries around it and make it holy, remember?'"
Exodus,19,24,"And God was like, 'Yo, go down there and then come back up with Aaron. But make sure the priests and the people don't try to break through and come up to me, because I might just go all out on them.'"
Exodus,19,25,So Moses went down to the people and started talking to them.
Exodus,20,1,"So, like, God totally said all this cool stuff, like,"
Exodus,20,2,"I'm the Almighty, your God, who rescued you from Egypt, from a life of slavery."
Exodus,20,3,"Don't put any other gods before me, period."
Exodus,20,4,"Don't go making any carved statues or any images of stuff in the sky, on the ground, or underwater."
Exodus,20,5,"Yo, don't go worshipping other gods or being their servants, 'cause I, the LORD your God, am like super possessive. I keep an eye on those who hate me, and I make sure their kids and grandkids pay for their wrongdoings for, like, the next three or four generations."
Exodus,20,6,"And like, being super kind to thousands of peeps who like, totally love me and do whatever I say."
Exodus,20,7,"Don't use God's name as a meaningless phrase, because God won't let you get away with it."
Exodus,20,8,"Yo, don't forget to vibe on the sabbath day and keep it super sacred."
Exodus,20,9,"Yo, work hard and grind for six days, and complete all your tasks, fam:"
Exodus,20,10,"Btw, the seventh day is, like, the chill day of the LORD your God. You and your squad, including your fam, your helpers, and even your pets, gotta take a break and not hustle or do any tasks, yo. Also, any outsiders who are hangin' with you should join in on the downtime within your crib."
Exodus,20,11,"So, like, God totally created everything we see - the sky, the earth, the ocean, and all the living things - in just six days. And then, on the seventh day, He was like, 'I'm gonna take a break'. And because of that, He blessed the seventh day and made it all holy and stuff."

Exodus,20,18,"And like, everyone saw the sick thunder and lightning and the crazy loud trumpet noise, and the whole mountain was smokin'! And yo, when the people saw all that, they straight up dipped and stood far away, man."
Exodus,20,19,"And they were like, 'Yo Moses, you talk to us and we'll listen, but like, don't let God talk to us directly 'cause that's mad scary and we might straight up die.'"
Exodus,20,20,"So, listen up, peeps! Moses was like, 'No worries, fam! God is pulling a test on you to make sure you stay on the right path and don't mess up.'"
Exodus,20,21,"And the peeps stood far away, and Moses slid into the dark vibes where God {was}."
Exodus,20,22,"And God was like, yo Moses, go tell the peeps of Israel that they saw me straight up chatting with them from heaven."
Exodus,20,23,"Don't even think about creating silver or gold gods to replace me, alright? Like, just don't. It's a big no-no."
Exodus,20,24,"Yo, make an earth altar for me and make sacrifices there, offering up your burnt offerings, peace offerings, sheep, and oxen. Whenever I put my name on a spot, I'll show up and bless you."
Exodus,20,25,"Yo, if you wanna construct an altar for me, don't use no fancy stone carvings. Keep it raw, bro. 'Cause if you start chiseling away at it, you're straight up defiling it, man. Just sayin'. #NoToolOnAltar"
Exodus,20,26,"Don't climb up to my altar using stairs, so your lack of clothes won't be exposed."

Exodus,21,7,"If someone sells his daughter to work as a maidservant, remember that she won't be free like the manservants."

Exodus,21,20,"If someone hits their servant or maid with a rod and causes their death, they will definitely be held accountable and face consequences. {consequences: Hebrew avenged}"

Exodus,32,8,"OMG, they totally ditched the path I told them to follow! Like, they created a super cool golden calf, started worshipping it, and even offered sacrifices to it. And get this, they were like, 'Yo, Israel, these are your gods who totally saved you from Egypt!'"
Exodus,32,9,"And God was like, 'Yo Moses, check it out, I've noticed these peeps and let me tell you, they are hella stubborn! 😤"
Exodus,32,10,"Yo, just back off for a sec, I need to let out some steam and go off on them, and maybe even wipe them out. But don't worry, I got big plans for you—I'll make you the founder of an epic nation."
Exodus,32,11,"So Moses straight up went to God and was like, 'Yo Lord, why you gotta be so heated with your people? I mean, you literally flexed your power and rescued them from Egypt with mad strength!'"
Exodus,32,12,"Bruh, why would the Egyptians be talking smack like, 'He only brought them outta here to mess 'em up and kill 'em in the mountains, wiping 'em off the face of the earth!' Yo, chill out with that anger and change your mind about bringing disaster on your own people, aight?"
Exodus,32,13,"Yo, chill for a sec and remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, those homies who you made a promise to. You were like, 'Bro, I swear on my own self, I'm gonna make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky, and this whole land I'm talking about will be theirs forever.'"
Exodus,32,14,And God changed His mind about the bad stuff He was gonna do to His people.
Exodus,32,15,"So Moses turned and went down from the mountain, holding the two tablets with the commandments. These tablets had writing on both sides, y'know? It was like a double-sided message from God."
Exodus,32,16,"The tables were made by God, and the writing was God's own writing, carved into the tables."
Exodus,32,17,"Yo, when Joshua heard all that commotion from the peeps shoutin', he goes up to Moses and says, 'Bro, there's like a war goin' down in the camp, man.'"
Exodus,32,18,"And he was like, yo, that's not the sound of people flexing or whining about getting defeated. Nahh, it's the sweet sound of those who are killing it with their amazing voices. #PowerOfMusic"
Exodus,32,19,"So, like, when Moses got close to the camp, he saw the whole calf thing and everyone dancing. Let me tell you, his anger was off the charts! He straight up throws the tablets out of his hands and smashes them right at the foot of the mountain."
Exodus,32,20,"So, like, he took the calf they had made and straight up roasted it in the fire. Then, he like totally crushed it into powder and sprinkled it on the water. And to complete the vibe, he made the children of Israel drink from it. Can you imagine?!"
Exodus,32,21,"Yo Aaron, what did these people do to you that made you bring down such a massive sin on them?"
Exodus,32,22,"And Aaron was like, yo chill, my dude. You know these people, they always up to no good."
Exodus,32,23,"So they were like, um, make us gods to lead us 'cause, you know, we don't know what happened to this Moses guy who brought us out of Egypt."
Exodus,32,24,"So I was like, 'Yo, if anyone's got any gold, just break it off and hand it to me.' And boom, they actually did it. So I straight up tossed that gold into the fire and guess what? This freaking calf popped out."
Exodus,32,25,"And when Moses peeped that the people were like, totally exposed (cuz Aaron made them expose themselves, which was, like, super embarrassing in front of their haters, you know?)"
Exodus,32,26,"So Moses pulls up at the entrance of the camp, and he's like, yo, who's down to ride with the Lord? Come roll up on me. And all the Levites gathered up and joined his squad."
Exodus,32,27,"Yo, listen up! The LORD God of Israel has a message for y'all. Grab your swords and walk around the whole camp, from gate to gate. And here's the deal: take out your own brother, your best friend, and even your neighbor. It's time to bring the heat, fam."
Exodus,32,28,"So, the Levi squad was like, totally following what Moses said, and like, that day, about three thousand dudes bit the dust."
Exodus,32,29,"Moses was like, yo, take this seriously and show mad respect to the LORD today. Each person, including fathers and brothers, gotta be all in, so we can get blessed, like big time. #TeamLORD #BlessedDay"
Exodus,32,30,"The next day, Moses told the peeps, 'Y'all messed up big-time and sinned real bad. But don't trip, I'm gonna go talk to the LORD and see if I can make it right for ya.'"
Exodus,32,31,"So Moses went back to the LORD and was like, 'Yo, these people totally messed up - they straight up went and made themselves some gold idols to worship.'"
Exodus,32,32,"But like, if you're down to forgive their mistake, awesome; but if not, could you just like, remove me from that book you made?"
Exodus,32,33,"And God was like, yo Moses, anyone who disrespects me, I'm straight up erasing them from my record book."
Exodus,32,34,"Okay, so here's the plan: go and guide the people to the spot I told you about. You gotta trust me on this one, because my angel is gonna accompany you. But here's the thing, when the time comes and I pay them a visit, I'll totally hold them accountable for their sins."
Exodus,32,35,"Yo, God straight up punished the peeps for makin' that calf, the one Aaron whipped up."
Exodus,33,1,"So, God was like, 'Hey Moses, peace out and head on out of here with the crew you saved from Egypt. We're jetting off to the land I promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, where your descendants will score big time.'"
Exodus,33,2,"I got your back with an angel squad; those Canaanite, Amorite, and Hittite peeps, as well as the Perizzite, Hivite, and Jebusite, they're getting yeeted outta here!"
Exodus,33,3,To a rad land with all the yummy stuff: 'cause I won't roll with you peeps since you're stubborn AF. Don't wanna end up obliterating you on the way.
Exodus,33,4,"When the people heard this bad news, they were so bummed out that none of them bothered to get all fancy with their bling."
Exodus,33,5,"The LORD told Moses to tell the children of Israel that they're being stubborn. I'm gonna show up and take care of business real quick, so take off your fancy stuff. I need to figure out what I'm gonna do with you all."
Exodus,33,6,"So, the Israelites totally ditched their bling at Mount Horeb."
Exodus,33,7,"So Moses grabbed the tabernacle and set it up outside the camp, a good distance away. He named it the Tabernacle of the gathering. And guess what? Whenever people wanted to connect with the LORD, they would leave the camp and head over to the tabernacle of the gathering that was outside the camp."
Exodus,33,8,"So, like, Moses left his crib and headed over to the tabernacle, and when he did, all the people got up and stood outside their own tents, just peeping at Moses until he disappeared into the tabernacle."
Exodus,33,9,"So, like, Moses goes into the tabernacle, right? And then, this rad cloudy pillar comes down and chills at the entrance, ya know. And then, boom, God starts chatting with Moses."
Exodus,33,10,"And everyone saw the cool cloud thingy chillin' by the entrance of the tent, and everyone stood up and worshipped, each person at their own tent door."
Exodus,33,11,"God straight up talked to Moses like they were besties, like just chatting it up. Then Moses went back to the camp, but his homie Joshua, who was a young dude, stayed in the tabernacle the whole time. No breaks."
Exodus,33,12,"So Moses was like, 'Yo, God! You're telling me to bring up these people, but you haven't told me who you're gonna send with me. But you did say that you know me and you've found favor with me."
Exodus,33,13,"Yo, like, if you're diggin' me and showing me love, can you drop some knowledge on me? I wanna understand your ways, get to know you better, and keep your favor. Oh, and don't forget, we're your own peeps, so keep us in mind."
Exodus,33,14,"And he was like, don't worry fam, I'll totally stick by your side and hook you up with some much-needed chill vibes."
Exodus,33,15,"And he's like, if you're not gonna come with us, then we shouldn't even bother leaving this place."
Exodus,33,16,"Like, how can we even know that you're cool with us if you don't actually roll with us? That's like the ultimate proof that we're totally set apart from everyone else on this planet."
Exodus,33,17,"And God was like, 'Yo Moses, I got you. I'm totally gonna do what you've asked, because you're super cool in my book and I totally know you like really well.'"
Exodus,33,18,"And he was like, yo, can you please let me see your awesomeness?"
Exodus,33,19,"And he was like, I'll totally flex all my goodness right in front of you, and I'll drop the name of the LORD on you; and I'll be super chill with those I wanna be, and I'll show some mad mercy to those I wanna show mercy to."
Exodus,33,20,"And he was like, bro, you can't see my face, man. Like, no one can see me and still be alive, you know?"
Exodus,33,21,"Yo, the LORD was like, check it out, I got this dope spot right next to me, and you gonna be posted up on a solid rock, fam:"
Exodus,33,22,"And it's gonna happen when I flex my awesomeness, I'll place you in this dope spot in the rocks, and I'll totally shield you with my hand as I walk by:"
Exodus,33,23,"And I'll pull back my hand, and you'll catch a glimpse of my backside: but my face isn't gonna show up in the selfie."
Exodus,34,1,"So, the LORD was like, 'Yo, Moses! Grab some stone tablets, just like the ones before, and I'll write the same words on them that were on the first tablets you broke.'"
Exodus,34,2,Be prepared and head up to Mount Sinai in the morning. Meet me at the top of the mountain.
Exodus,34,3,"No one can join you, nobody should be visible on the entire mountain, and the animals shouldn't graze near the mountain."
Exodus,34,4,"So he made two stone tablets just like the first ones. Then, early in the morning, Moses went up to Mount Sinai as the LORD told him, taking the two stone tablets with him."
Exodus,34,5,"And God like, came down in this totally lit cloud, and stood with him, and started announcing His epic name."
Exodus,34,6,"And then God rolled up, flexed, and was like, 'Yo, I'm God, the one and only. I'm all about showing mercy, grace, being patient, and overflowing with goodness and truth.'"
Exodus,34,7,"God is all about showing mercy to countless people, forgiving their wrongdoings and sins. But that doesn't mean the guilty can just be let off the hook. There are consequences for the actions of the previous generations that can affect the children and even the grandchildren for a few generations."
Exodus,34,8,Moses quickly bowed down and showed his respect by worshipping.
Exodus,34,9,"And he was like, yo, if I've scored some major chill vibes with you, Lord, can you pleeease roll with us? 'Cause, let's be real, we can be a pretty stubborn crowd. But, like, forgive us for our wrongdoings and accept us as your chosen crew, you know?"
Exodus,34,10,"And he was like, yo, listen up, I'm about to drop a major flex: in front of all your squad, I'm gonna pull off some mind-blowing tricks that no one has ever seen before, no cap! And all the peeps in your crew will witness the epic power moves of the LORD, 'cause what I'm about to do is straight-up mind-blowing!"
Exodus,34,11,"Yo, listen up! Pay attention to what I'm telling you today: check it out, I'm about to kick out the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite right in front of you."
Exodus,34,12,"Yo, listen up fam, be careful not to get yourself caught up in a sketchy deal with the peeps living in the land you're headed to. It could totally trap you and mess you up big time. So watch out!"
Exodus,34,13,"But y'all gotta wreck their altars, smash their statues, and chop down their fancy nature spots."
Exodus,34,14,"Yo, don't even think about worshipping other gods, 'cause the LORD, who goes by Jealous, is super possessive about being the only God."
Exodus,34,15,"Make sure you don't sign up for a collab with the locals, 'cause they'll totally ditch their values and start chasing after their own idols. They'll try to convince you to join in on their sacrifices, even slide into your DMs and invite you to feast on their offerings."
Exodus,34,16,"So, like, if you end up getting with their daughters and stuff, you know? And their daughters start chasing after gods that aren't cool, dragging your sons along with them. It's a total mess."
Exodus,34,17,"Don't even think about creating any lit AF idols, fam."

Exodus,34,20,"But if your firstborn donkey has to be redeemed, replace it with a lamb; and if you don't redeem it, then you have to break its neck. You have to redeem all your firstborn sons, no one should come before me empty-handed. (lamb: or, kid)"

Exodus,34,22,"And you gotta celebrate the lit party of weeks, when the first dope crops of wheat come in, and the epic feast of gathering at the end of the year. *year's end: in Hebrew, it means the crazy circle of the year*"
Exodus,34,23,"Like, three times a year, all your dudes gotta show up in front of the Lord GOD, the God of Israel."
Exodus,34,24,"Because I'm gonna flex and push those other nations aside, and make your territory super-sized. No one's gonna even think about snatching up your land while you're on your way to worship the LORD your God three times a year."

Exodus,34,27,"Yo, Moses, listen up! The big man upstairs, the LORD, He's telling you to jot down these words. It's legit, 'cause based on these words, He's making a solid pact with you and all of Israel."
Exodus,34,28,"So, like, he literally kicked it with the LORD for, like, a solid 40 days and 40 nights without even munching on any bread or chugging water. And get this, he actually wrote down on these tables the legit words of the covenant, you know, like the ten commandments. #NoFilter"

Exodus,34,30,"So, when Aaron and all the fam of Israel peeped Moses, straight up, his face was glowing and they were lowkey scared to come near him."
Exodus,34,31,"So Moses was like, 'Hey, come here!' And Aaron and all the big shots of the crew came back to him. Then Moses had a chill convo with them."
Exodus,34,32,"And then all the Israelites rolled up, and God gave them instructions about everything he had said to Moses on Mount Sinai."
Exodus,34,33,"And once Moses finished talking to them, he covered his face with a veil."

Exodus,35,2,"Yo, listen up! So, for six days straight, y'all gotta hustle and get that work done. But on the seventh day, it's time to chill and have a totally sacred, restful day for the LORD.

Exodus,36,6,"So Moses was like, 'Yo, listen up everyone!' He made it loud and clear to all the peeps in the camp that they gotta stop with all the work for the sanctuary offering. And you know what? They actually listened and stopped bringing stuff."
Exodus,36,7,They had enough stuff to do the work and then some.
Exodus,36,8,"And all the smart guys who were working on the tabernacle made ten curtains out of fancy woven linen, decorated with cool blue, purple, and red colors, and cleverly designed cherubim."
Exodus,36,9,"One curtain was like 28 cubits long and 4 cubits wide, and all the curtains were the same size."
Exodus,36,10,"Then he like, connected the five curtains together, and connected the other five curtains together too."
Exodus,36,11,"Then he put some cool blue loops on the edge of one curtain, starting from the cool edge of the fabric. He did the same thing on the other side of another curtain, at the connecting point of the second curtain. (Psst, 'selvedge' means an edge of cloth that won't unravel.)"
Exodus,36,12,"He put fifty loops on one curtain, and fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was next to it. These loops kept the curtains together."

Exodus,36,15,"Each curtain was, like, 30 cubits long and 4 cubits wide, ya know? And all the eleven curtains were like totally the same size."
Exodus,36,16,"So, he like, joined five curtains all together, and then six curtains all together, you know."
Exodus,36,17,"Then he attached fifty loops to the outer edge of the curtain, and he attached fifty loops to the edge of the curtain that joins the second one."
Exodus,36,18,"And he slapped together fifty shiny metal thingies to connect the tent, so it would all stay put and be one solid unit."
Exodus,36,19,"So he flexed with a sick tent cover made of red-dyed rams' skins, and topped it off with an extra fly badgers' skins layer. 😎"
Exodus,36,20,"And he crafted some epic boards for the tabernacle out of shittim wood, standing up like bosses."

Exodus,36,29,"And they were like totally linked together underneath, and they were like connected at the top with this rad ring: so both of them were styled like that wickedly in both corners. {coupled: Hebrew twinned}"
Exodus,36,30,"So there were like eight boards, and they had these like sixteen silver sockets. Each board had two sockets underneath. You know, two sockets stacked up under one board."
Exodus,36,31,"Then he crafted sturdy bars using shittim wood, five for the boards on one side of the tabernacle."
Exodus,36,32,"And there were like five sick bars on each side of the chill tabernacle, and another five sick bars on the west side of the tabernacle walls."
Exodus,36,33,"And he created this super cool metal rod that went straight through the boards from one side to the other, like a boss."
Exodus,36,34,"Then he flexed those boards with some mad gold, and crafted solid gold rings as holders for the bars. And yeah, he totally covered the bars with more gold, straight up blinging the whole setup."
Exodus,36,35,"And he crafted a cool-looking curtain using blue, purple, scarlet, and fancy linen. He even added some cleverly designed cherubim to make it extra special."
Exodus,36,36,"And he used four lit pillars made of shittim wood, and covered them in gold: their hooks were made of gold; and he molded four silver sockets for them."

Exodus,36,38,"And the five support structures were equipped with hooks, and their tops and bands were covered in gold, while their bases were made of brass."
Exodus,37,1,"So Bezaleel built the ark out of shittim wood. It was super cool, measuring two cubits and a half in length, and a cubit and a half in width and height. Pretty rad, right?"

Exodus,37,6,"Then he crafted the mercy seat out of solid gold, measuring two and a half cubits in length and one and a half cubits in width."
Exodus,37,7,"So, like, he crafted these two golden cherubims, right? He totally hammered them out from one solid piece, and then placed them on the two sides of the mercy seat. You know, the spot where God's presence resides. #ArtSkills"
Exodus,37,8,There was like a cool angel at one side and another rad angel on the opposite side. These angels were made from the mercy seat itself. So fly!
Exodus,37,9,"And the cherub squad flexed their wings up high, covering the mercy seat like a boss. They faced each other, with their gazes locked on the mercy seat. Talk about squad goals!"

Leviticus,3,17,"Here's a rule that's gonna stick around forever for all y'all, no matter where you live: don't chow down on fatty stuff or slurp up any blood."
Leviticus,4,1,"Yo, God hit up Moses and was like,"
Leviticus,4,2,"Yo, listen up, Israelites! So, like, if someone unintentionally messes up and breaks any of God's commandments, doing something they shouldn't do,"
Leviticus,4,3,"If the priest, who is anointed, messes up like the rest of us, then he needs to offer a perfect young bull as a sin offering to make things right with the LORD."
Leviticus,4,4,Then he's gotta take the bull to the entrance of the hangout spot where God's peeps gather. He'll put his hand on the bull's head and take it down in front of the Lord.
Leviticus,4,5,Then the priest who has been anointed will take some blood from the bull and bring it to the meeting spot in the cool tabernacle:
Leviticus,4,6,"Then the priest will dab his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times in front of the LORD, right by the curtain of the sacred place."
Leviticus,4,7,"Then the priest will take some of the blood and put it on the corners of the special altar in front of the LORD, which is inside the sacred tent. He will pour all the blood of the bull at the base of the big altar where they burn sacrifices, which is located right by the entrance of the sacred tent."
Leviticus,4,8,"And he's gonna like, totally remove all the fat from the bull for the sin offering. You know, the fat that's like covering the insides, and all the fat that's on the insides. Can't have any of that fat, dude!"
Leviticus,4,9,"And like, you gotta totally take those two kidneys and the fat that's on them, ya know, the one by the flanks and that caul thingy above the liver. And dudette, don't forget to remove the kidneys along with all that stuff!"
Leviticus,4,10,"Just like when you separate the good stuff from the bull offered as a peaceful sacrifice, the priest's gonna burn it up on the super hot altar for burnt offerings."
Leviticus,4,11,"And, like, the whole skin and body of the bull, including its head, legs, insides, and poop,"
Leviticus,4,12,"He's gotta take the whole bull outside the camp to a clean spot where they dump the ashes, and burn it up on some wood with fire. Gotta make sure it's burned up at that ash dumping spot."
Leviticus,4,13,"And yo, if the whole squad of Israel messes up by accident and the crew ain't even aware of it, and they've gone and done something against one of the LORD's commandments that shouldn't be done, and they're guilty;"
Leviticus,4,14,"So, like, if someone messes up big time and everyone finds out about it, the whole squad needs to bring a young bull to the hangout spot outside the meeting place, as an apology for the messed up thing they did."
Leviticus,4,15,"The older guys in the group are gonna place their hands on the bull's head in front of the LORD, and then they're gonna off the bull right there in front of the LORD."
Leviticus,4,16,And the priest who's been blessed will take some of the bull's blood and bring it to the tabernacle where everyone gathers:
Leviticus,4,17,"Yo, the priest gonna dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it like seven times in front of the LORD, you know, right before the curtain."
Leviticus,4,18,"And he's gotta drip some of the blood on the altar's horns, the one right in front of the LORD, in the tabernacle hangout. Then he's gotta spill all the blood at the base of the altar for the burnt offering, right by the tabernacle's entrance."
Leviticus,4,19,And he's gonna remove all the fat from that animal and totally roast it on the altar.
Leviticus,4,20,"And he's gonna do the same thing with this bull as he did with the other one for a sin offering. The priest is gonna make things right for them, and they'll be forgiven."
Leviticus,4,21,"And he's gotta take the bull outside the hangout spot, and roast it just like he roasted the first bull, 'cause it's a sacrifice to make up for the crew's sins."
Leviticus,4,22,"If a leader messes up and accidentally breaks any of God's commandments by doing something wrong that they didn't know about, and becomes guilty;"
Leviticus,4,23,"If he realizes he has sinned, he should bring a perfect male goat as his offering."
Leviticus,4,24,He's gonna put his hand on the goat's head and take it out in the same spot where they do the burnt offering for the LORD. It's like a sacrifice for sin and stuff.
Leviticus,4,25,"Then the priest will take some of the blood from the sin offering and dab it on the corners of the big altar, and pour the rest of the blood at the base of the big altar."
Leviticus,4,26,"And he's gotta roast all that fat on the altar, like the fatty peace offering sacrifice. The priest will make things right for him and forgive his sin."
Leviticus,4,27,"And if, like, anyone from the regular peeps accidentally messes up and does something against the Lord's commandments, you know, like things that shouldn't be done, and they feel guilty about it, then... yeah."
Leviticus,4,28,"If someone realizes they have sinned, they need to bring a flawless female goat as an offering to make up for their wrongdoing."
Leviticus,4,29,"Then he'll put his hand on the head of the sin offering and take care of it right there, instead of the burnt offering."
Leviticus,4,30,Then the priest will dab some of the blood with his finger and dab it on the corners of the sacrifice altar and pour out all the blood at the base of the altar.
Leviticus,4,31,"And like, the priest gotta remove all the fat from it, just like how fat is removed from a peace offering sacrifice, you know? And then the priest gotta burn it on the altar, and it's all for that sweet aroma that the LORD loves, man. It's like a way for the priest to make things right for the person and get their forgiveness."
Leviticus,4,32,"And if he brings a lamb for a sin offering, he's gotta bring a flawless female one."
Leviticus,4,33,"And he's gonna place his hand on the head of the sin offering and, like, kill it as a sin offering where they do the same for the burnt offering."
Leviticus,4,34,"And the priest will take some of the blood from the sin offering and dab it on the edges of the lit altar, and then pour out all the blood at the base of the altar:"
Leviticus,4,35,"And he's gotta remove all the fat, like how you take out the fat from the lamb sacrifice for peace offerings. Then the priest has to burn them on the altar, just like the fire offerings to the LORD. By doing this, the priest fixes his mistake and gets his sins forgiven."
Leviticus,5,1,"If someone messes up and hears somebody swearing, and they're a witness, whether they saw it or knew about it; if they don't speak up, then they will be responsible for their own mistake."
Leviticus,5,2,"If someone comes into contact with something unclean, like a dead unclean animal or a dead unclean bug, and they didn't even realize it, they will also become unclean and at fault."
Leviticus,5,3,"If he gets involved with something that makes a person unclean, like any kind of uncleanness, and he doesn't realize it, but later finds out, then he's in the wrong."
Leviticus,5,4,"If someone makes a promise, swearing to do something bad or good, whatever it is that they promise with an oath, even if they forget about it, once they realize what they promised, they'll be considered guilty for breaking it."
Leviticus,5,5,"When somebody messes up in any of these situations, they gotta own up and admit that they screwed up:"
Leviticus,5,6,"So this dude needs to bring his apology gift to the big man upstairs for the wrong things he did. It's gotta be a female sheep or baby goat, like a lamb or a kid of the goats, as a way to say sorry. And the priest will take care of all the forgiveness stuff for him."
Leviticus,5,7,"And if he can't afford to bring a lamb, then he should bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons as a way to make up for his wrongdoings before the LORD. One bird will be a sacrifice for his sins, and the other one will be entirely burnt as an offering."
Leviticus,5,8,"Then he'll take them to the priest, who will offer the sin offering first and twist off its head without tearing it apart:"
Leviticus,5,9,"And he's gonna like, sprinkle some of that sin offering blood on the side of the altar. And the rest of the blood is gonna be, like, squeezed out at the bottom, you know? It's like, totally a sin offering."
Leviticus,5,10,"And he should offer the second one as a burn sacrifice, following the usual way. The priest will then make things right for him, making up for the sin he committed, and he will be forgiven. (manner: or, ordinance)"
Leviticus,5,11,"But if he can't bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then the person who sinned should offer one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a sin offering. They shouldn't put any oil or frankincense on it, because it's for a sin offering."
Leviticus,5,12,"Then you gotta take that thing to the priest, and the priest is gonna take a lil' handful of it, as a reminder, and burn it up on the altar, just like the other offerings that are set on fire for the LORD. Yeah, it's like a way of saying sorry for messing up or doing something wrong."
Leviticus,5,13,"The priest will help him make things right for the sin he messed up with, and he'll be forgiven. The rest of the stuff belongs to the priest, like a snack."
Leviticus,5,14,"God texted Moses, like,"
Leviticus,5,15,"If someone accidentally does something wrong and sins without realizing it in the sacred things belonging to the LORD, they should bring a perfect ram from their flock as a way to make amends, valuing it in silver coins based on the standard weight of the sanctuary, as a way to compensate for their mistake."
Leviticus,5,16,"If someone messes up with something sacred, they gotta make it right. They gotta pay an extra 20% and give it to the priest. The priest will fix things up with a special sacrifice and then it's all good, forgiven!"
Leviticus,5,17,"So, like, if someone messes up and does any of the stuff that the Lord says not to do, even if they didn't realize it, they still messed up and gotta own up to it."
Leviticus,5,18,"He has to grab a flawless ram from his squad, valued as a trespass offering, and take it to the priest. The priest will make things right for him when he messes up unknowingly and doesn't have a clue, and he'll be forgiven."
Leviticus,5,19,"Yo, this a straight-up apology gift. Dude totally messed up big time and seriously offended the LORD."
Leviticus,6,1,"So, like, God talked to Moses and was like,"
Leviticus,6,2,"If someone messes up and does something wrong against the LORD, like lying to their homie about taking care of their stuff, or ripping them off or stealing from them, or straight-up deceiving them..."
Leviticus,6,3,Or if you find something that was lost and lie about it or swear falsely—any of these actions is a sinful thing to do.
Leviticus,6,4,"If someone messes up and does something wrong, causing harm or taking something by force or trickery, or if they were entrusted with something to keep and it got lost, they gotta make it right and give it back."
Leviticus,6,5,"If someone lies about something they swore to, they have to give it back and add an extra twenty percent. They have to give it to the person it belongs to on the day they say sorry for what they did."
Leviticus,6,6,"And he's gotta bring his trespass offering to the LORD, a flawless ram from the crew, valued just right, as a trespass offering to the priest:"
Leviticus,6,7,"And the priest, like, totally fixes things up for him in front of the LORD, and bam! It's forgiven, dude! Everything he messed up and did wrong in that situation, he's in the clear now."
Leviticus,6,8,"Yo, God was like, Mosess, check this out'"
Leviticus,6,9,"Yo, Aaron and his squad gotta follow this rule: When it comes to the burnt offering, it's all about keeping that fire burning on the altar all night until morning. That fire gotta stay lit, ya feel me?"
Leviticus,6,10,"The priest gotta get dressed in his linen outfit, including linen pants. Then he gotta scoop up the ashes from the burnt offering on the altar and put 'em next to the altar."
Leviticus,6,11,"Then he has to change his clothes, put on different ones, and take the ashes outside the camp to a spot that's clean."
Leviticus,6,12,"The fire on the altar gotta keep burnin' nonstop, can't let it die out. The priest's gotta throw some wood on it every morning and arrange the burnt offering on top. Then he's gotta burn that fat from the peace offerings on there."
Leviticus,6,13,"The flame on the altar gotta stay lit 24/7, no extinguishing allowed."
Leviticus,6,14,"So, like, this is the rule for the meat offering, okay? The sons of Aaron gotta offer it to the Lord, right in front of the altar."
Leviticus,6,15,"And he's gonna take some of that flour, oil, and frankincense from the meat offering and burn it on the altar. It's gonna be a dope smell that reminds everyone of the Lord."
Leviticus,6,16,"Aaron and his homies gotta chow down on the leftovers: grab some unleavened bread and feast in the sacred spot, right in the court of the tabernacle where everyone gathers."
Leviticus,6,17,"Don't even think about adding any leaven to it. I've designated it as their special share of my fire offerings, and it's super sacred, just like the sin offering and the trespass offering."
Leviticus,6,18,"All the guys from Aaron's fam gotta grub on this. It's a forever rule for your fam to follow when it comes to the lit offerings for the LORD, cooked by fire. And whoever messes with 'em gotta stay holy."
Leviticus,6,19,"Then God spoke to Moses, like,"
Leviticus,6,20,"Yo, peep this offering from Aaron and his homies, that they gotta bring to the LORD on the day he's anointed. It's like a tenth of an ephah of high-quality flour, always a solid meat offering. Split it up, half in the morning and the other half at night."
Leviticus,6,21,"You gotta use oil when cookin' it in a pan. After it's baked, bring it in. Then, offer the baked pieces of the meat as a delicious smellin' offering to the LORD."
Leviticus,6,22,"And the TikTok-famous priest who takes over for his dad will be the one to offer it: tiktok it's a forever rule for the Lord; like, it's gotta be completely roasted."
Leviticus,6,23,"Like, all the food offerings for the priest gotta be totally burnt, dude. No munching on them, okay?"
Leviticus,6,24,"God was like, 'Yo, Moses, listen up,'"
Leviticus,6,25,"Yo, Aaron and his squad, listen up. This is the deal with the sin offering: You gotta kill it where you usually do the burnt offering, in front of the LORD. Trust me, it's super sacred."
Leviticus,6,26,"The priest who sacrifices it for sin gets to chow down on it: it gets eaten in the holy spot, specifically in the tabernacle courtyard."
Leviticus,6,27,"Anything that comes into contact with it must be considered sacred. And if any of its blood splatters onto clothing, you must wash those garments in a special area designated for sacred rituals."
Leviticus,6,28,"But the pot you use for cooking must be shattered if it's made of clay, and if it's made of bronze, it must be scrubbed and washed with water."
Leviticus,6,29,"All the dudes who are priests get to chow down on it: super sacred vibes, bro."
Leviticus,6,30,And you can't eat any sin offering that has its blood brought into the tabernacle to make things right in the holy place. It has to be burnt up in the fire instead.
Leviticus,7,1,"So basically, this is the deal with the trespass offering: it's like super sacred and pure, you know."
Leviticus,7,2,"In the spot where they do the sacrifice for the burnt offering, that's where they'll handle the trespass offering too. Sprinkle the blood all around the altar."
Leviticus,7,3,"And he's gonna give up all that juicy fat; the thicc booty and the fat covering the guts,"
Leviticus,7,4,"And like, you gotta remove the two kidneys and that juicy fat surrounding them, ya know, by the flanks. And also the caul thingy above the liver, along with the kidneys, he's gotta take 'em away, man."
Leviticus,7,5,"And the priest gotta yeet them onto the altar, a lit sacrifice for the LORD. It's like a way of saying sorry for messing up."
Leviticus,7,6,"All the dudes who are priests gotta eat that stuff, and they gotta chow down on it in the special holy spot, 'cause it's like super duper holy, you know?"
Leviticus,7,7,"The sin offering and the trespass offering are like two peas in a pod, yo. They gotta follow the same rules and regulations, no exceptions. Only the priest who performs the atonement with it is legit."
Leviticus,7,8,And the priest who presents someone's burnt offering gets to keep the skin of the offering for himself.
Leviticus,7,9,All the lit snacks that are baked or fried in the stove and pan belong to the priest who offers them. (Alternative: on the fancy plate or as a slice)
Leviticus,7,10,And the sons of Aaron shall each receive an equal share of every meat offering that is mixed with oil and is dry.
Leviticus,7,11,"So, like, this is the deal with the peace offerings, fam. It's all about this law that says you gotta offer it up to the big man upstairs, the LORD."
Leviticus,7,12,"If he wants to give thanks, then he should bring some lit unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and some anointed unleavened wafers with oil, and some epic fried cakes made with fine flour."
Leviticus,7,13,"And on top of the usual cakes, he's gotta bring some fresh bread along with his thanksgiving offering and peace offerings."
Leviticus,7,14,"And from that, the priest should take one as a special offering to the LORD. It will belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings."
Leviticus,7,15,"And like, the meat of the peace offering he's given as a gratitude thing, it's got to be eaten on the same day it's brought, you know? Don't save any of it for later, bro, finish it up before morning."
Leviticus,7,16,"But if the sacrifice he gives is a vow or a freewill offering, he should chow it down on the same day he gives it, and whatever's left should be devoured the next day too:"
Leviticus,7,17,"But on the third day, you gotta burn up the rest of that sacrifice meat with fire."
Leviticus,7,18,"And yo, if anyone eats any of the meat from their peace offerings on the third day, it's a major no-go. It won't count as an acceptable offering, and the person who eats it will be totally guilty for their wrongdoing. It's like a straight-up abomination, fam."
Leviticus,7,19,"If you come into contact with anything dirty, don't eat the meat. Burn it up! But if the meat is clean, go ahead and dig in, fam!"
Leviticus,7,20,"But if someone eats the meat from the peace offerings that is dedicated to the LORD, while they are unclean, they will be separated from their community."
Leviticus,7,21,"And if someone touches something impure, whether it's something impure from a person, an impure animal, or something disgusting and impure, and then eats the meat from a peace offering that belongs to the LORD, that person will be separated from their community."
Leviticus,7,22,"God was like, 'Yo Moses, listen up,'"
Leviticus,7,23,"Hey, listen up, all you peeps in Israel! I've got somethin' important to say. Don't chow down on any fatty goodness from those beef, lamb, or goat dishes of yours, ya hear?"
Leviticus,7,24,"Yo, you know that fat from an animal that kicks the bucket on its own or gets torn up by other beasts? Yeah, you can totally use that fat for anything else you want, but no way should you be munching on it. Stay away from that stuff, fam. #respecttheanimals"
Leviticus,7,25,"If anyone chows down on the fatty part of an animal offered as a fiery sacrifice to the LORD, they're totally getting booted from their crew."
Leviticus,7,26,"Yo, don't be consuming any blood, whether it's from birds or animals, anywhere you live, alright?"
Leviticus,7,27,"If anyone eats any kind of blood, they'll be totally canceled from their clique."
Leviticus,7,28,"Yo, the LORD was like talking to Moses, and He was all like,"
Leviticus,7,29,"Yo, listen up, Israel fam! If you wanna offer some peace offerings to the big man upstairs, make sure you bring them right to the Lord as an oblation. Show some love for those peace offerings, y'all!"
Leviticus,7,30,"He himself will bring the lit offerings to the LORD, including the fat and the meat. He'll bring it all, so that the meat can be waved as an offering to the LORD."
Leviticus,7,31,"The priest's gotta grill up that fat on the altar, but the juicy breast meat belongs to Aaron and his crew."
Leviticus,7,32,And you gotta give the priest the right shoulder as a hella rad offering from the sacrifices you bring to show your chill vibes.
Leviticus,7,33,The dude from Aaron's squad who's in charge of offering up the blood and fat for the peace offerings gets to keep the right shoulder as their share.
Leviticus,7,34,"So, like, I've totally claimed the wave breast and heave shoulder from the Israelites' peace offerings, ya know? And forever, I've hooked Aaron the priest and his sons up with 'em as a solid rule for the fam. It's a gift that keeps on giving, bud, straight from the Israelite crew."
Leviticus,7,35,"This is the deal where Aaron and his squad get anointed with some lit gifts from the Lord. It went down on the day they stepped up to serve the Lord, doing their priest duties, all official-like."
Leviticus,7,36,"This is what the LORD said should be given to the children of Israel when they were anointed, and it should be a forever thing for all their future peeps."
Leviticus,7,37,"This is the deal with the burnt offering, meat offering, sin offering, trespass offering, consecrations, and sacrifice of the peace offerings."
Leviticus,7,38,"This is what God told Moses on Mount Sinai, when He commanded the Israelites to bring their offerings to Him, while they were in the middle of the Sinai desert."
Leviticus,8,1,"And then the LORD was like, 'Yo, Moses, listen up,'"
Leviticus,8,2,"Yo, grab Aaron and his homies, their dope outfits, that blessed oil, a bull for the sin sacrifice, two rams, and a basket of bread without that yeast, ya feel?"
Leviticus,8,3,"Yo, round up all the squad and bring 'em to the entrance of the sacred hangout spot, yo."
Leviticus,8,4,So Moses followed God's instructions and the entire crowd assembled at the entrance of the tent where they gathered to worship.
Leviticus,8,5,"And Moses was like, yo fam, listen up! This is the thing that the LORD straight up commanded us to do, you feel me?"
Leviticus,8,6,"So Moses gathered Aaron and his homies, and gave them a fresh wash."
Leviticus,8,7,"Then he dressed him up in the coat, put on a trendy belt, dressed him up in the cool robe, and placed the ephod on him. And he rocked the stylish belt that went with the ephod, and secured it to him."
Leviticus,8,8,"And he put the drip-worthy breastplate on him, and he slipped in the mad lit Urim and Thummim into the breastplate."
Leviticus,8,9,"Then he put the cool hat on his head, and on the front of the hat he placed a shiny golden plate, the special crown, just like the LORD told Moses."
Leviticus,8,10,"So, Moses grabbed the anointing oil and started putting it on the tabernacle and everything inside it, making it totally holy."
Leviticus,8,11,"Then he dabbed some on the altar about seven times, and put oil on the altar and all its stuff, including the fancy sink and its stand, to make it all holy and stuff."
Leviticus,8,12,"And he dripped some of that holy oil on Aaron's head, giving him a special blessing and making him super holy."
Leviticus,8,13,"So Moses brought Aaron's sons and dressed them in fancy clothes, and put belts around them, and placed stylish hats on their heads, just as the LORD told Moses to do."
Leviticus,8,14,"Then he brought the bullock for the sin offering, and Aaron and his squad placed their hands on the head of the bullock for the sin offering."
Leviticus,8,15,"Then he killed the animal, and Moses took the blood and spread it all around the edges of the altar with his finger. He cleansed the altar and poured the blood at the base of it, making it holy and able to bring peace and forgiveness."
Leviticus,8,16,"Then he gathered all the juicy stuff inside, like the fatty parts, the covering of the liver, the two kidneys, and their fat. Moses straight up burned it all on the altar."
Leviticus,8,17,"So, like, that bull and everything - the whole deal, like its hide, flesh, and dung - it was totally burned up outside the camp, just like the LORD told Moses to do."
Leviticus,8,18,"And he's like, yo, he brought the ram for that burnt offering, and Aaron and his squad placed their hands on the ram's head."
Leviticus,8,19,"And he straight up yeeted that thing; and Moses sprinkled the blood all around the altar, like a boss."
Leviticus,8,20,"Then he like, totally sliced up the ram, and Moses straight up burned the head, the chunks, and the fat. No waste, bro."
Leviticus,8,21,"Then he washed the insides and the legs with water. And Moses burned the entire ram on the altar. It was like a lit sacrifice, pleasing to the LORD, just as the LORD told Moses to do."
Leviticus,8,22,"Then he brought another ram, the special ram for consecration, and Aaron and his squad placed their hands on its head."
Leviticus,8,23,"So he killed the animal, and Moses took some of its blood and placed it on the tip of Aaron's right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot."
Leviticus,8,24,"Then Moses brought Aaron's sons and put some blood on the tip of their right ear, and on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. And Moses sprinkled the blood all around the altar."
Leviticus,8,25,"Then he gathered all the fat, the juicy parts, and the stuff inside, along with the stuff on top of the liver, the two kidneys, and their fat, and even the right shoulder:"
Leviticus,8,26,"And from the basket of unleavened bread, that was right there in front of the LORD, he grabbed one plain bread, and a bread with oil, and a thin crispy bread, and placed them on the fat, and on the right shoulder:"
Leviticus,8,27,"And he gave everything to Aaron and his sons, and they waved them as an offering to the LORD."
Leviticus,8,28,Then Moses grabbed them from their hands and lit them up on the altar along with the burnt offering. Those were like special goodies that smelled really good to God. It's a fire gift for the Lord.
Leviticus,8,29,"Then Moses took the juicy part of the ram and did a little wave action with it to present as an offering to the LORD. This was part of the special ram that Moses got, just like the LORD told him to do."
Leviticus,8,30,"So Moses grabbed some of that anointing oil and blood from the altar, and he sprinkled it on Aaron, his clothes, his sons, and their clothes. Basically, he made them all holy and set apart for a special purpose."
Leviticus,8,31,"Moses was like, 'Yo, Aaron and fam, you gotta cook up that meat right outside the holy meeting spot. Then you can chow down with the sacred bread from the special basket, just like I told you. Aaron and his sons gotta be the ones munching on it, no one else."
Leviticus,8,32,"You gotta torch the leftover meat and bread, fam. Burn it up real good with fire."
Leviticus,8,33,"And like, you can't leave the tabernacle hangout for a whole week until your consecration is over, man. It's like a sacred time, bro. You gotta stay put for seven days straight, 'cause that's how long it takes to get you all consecrated and stuff."
Leviticus,8,34,"Just like the Lord said, he did it today to make things right for you."
Leviticus,8,35,"So basically, you gotta hang out by the entrance of the tent where everyone gathers. Do this day and night for a whole week and make sure you follow all the rules God gave ya. It's super important, otherwise you might end up in big trouble. God made it clear, so just do it!"
Leviticus,8,36,So Aaron and his squad totally did everything the LORD told them to do through Moses.
Leviticus,9,1,"So, on the eighth day, Moses hit up Aaron and his boys, along with the senior peeps of Israel."
Leviticus,9,2,"Yo, Aaron, grab a fresh calf as a sacrifice for our sins, and a dope ram as a burnt offering. Make sure they're flawless, then present 'em to the LORD."
Leviticus,9,3,"Yo, Israel fam, listen up. So, here's the deal - when it comes to dealing with sins and stuff, you gotta grab a baby goat, like, as an offering. And not just that, but you also need to bring a young calf and a lamb, ya know, newborn and all, with no flaws or anything. These little buddies are gonna be, like, burnt offerings and whatnot."
Leviticus,9,4,"And bring a bullock and a ram for peace offerings to sacrifice before the LORD, along with a meat offering mixed with oil. Today the LORD is gonna show up for you."
Leviticus,9,5,"So they brought what Moses told them to bring to the tabernacle, and all the people gathered and stood in front of the Almighty."
Leviticus,9,6,"Moses was like, yo listen up! God gave us the lowdown on what we gotta do. And if we follow it, we gonna witness some epic divine awesomeness from the LORD."
Leviticus,9,7,"Yo, Aaron! Head to the altar and bring your sin offering, burnt offering, and make things right for yourself and the peeps. Offer the people's offering and make things right for them, just like the LORD told us."
Leviticus,9,8,"So Aaron went up to the altar and killed the sin offering calf, which was for himself."
Leviticus,9,9,"Then Aaron's boys brought him the blood and he like dipped his finger in it and put that stuff on the horns of the altar, and like spilled the rest of the blood at the bottom of the altar:"
Leviticus,9,10,"And he burned the fat, the kidneys, and the fatty layer above the liver of the sin offering on the altar, just as the LORD told Moses to do."
Leviticus,9,11,And he totally roasted the meat and the animal skin away from the camp using straight fire.
Leviticus,9,12,"And he totally slaughtered the burnt offering; and Aaron's squad presented him with the blood, which he sprinkled all around on the altar."
Leviticus,9,13,"And they gave him the burnt offering, along with its pieces and the head. And he burned them on the altar."
Leviticus,9,14,"And he washed the insides and the legs, then he burned them on the altar along with the burnt offering."
Leviticus,9,15,"Then he took the people's offering and grabbed the goat, which was the offering to make up for their mistakes. He killed it and presented it as a sacrifice to cleanse their sins, just like he did at first."
Leviticus,9,16,"And he brought the burnt offering and totally flexed it, following all the lit rules and stuff. *Or you know, the ordinance, if you prefer that term.*"
Leviticus,9,17,"Then he grabbed a handful of the meat offering and burnt it on the altar, alongside the burnt sacrifice from this morning. He filled his hand with it, ya know?"
Leviticus,9,18,"He also killed the bull and the sheep as a peace offering for the people, and Aaron's sons gave him the blood to sprinkle all around the altar."
Leviticus,9,19,"And like, the juicy parts of the bullock and ram, like the backside, and the stuff that covers the insides, and the kidneys, and the fatty part above the liver, ya know?"
Leviticus,9,20,"And they took the fat and placed it on top, then he burned it on the altar:"
Leviticus,9,21,"And Aaron flexed the boobs and the right shoulder, showing them off as an offering to the LORD, just like Moses told him to do."
Leviticus,9,22,"And Aaron raised his hand towards the people and blessed them, then he stepped down from making the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings."
Leviticus,9,23,"So Moses and Aaron entered the meeting hub, then came back out and gave a shoutout to the peeps. And boom, the amazing presence of the LORD was visible to everyone!"
Leviticus,9,24,"Then this fire just suddenly appeared in front of the LORD and totally destroyed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar! When everyone saw it, they were like freaking out and dropped to the ground, man."
Leviticus,10,1,"So Nadab and Abihu, Aaron's sons, each grabbed their own censer, loaded it with fire and added incense. They went ahead and offered unauthorized fire before the Lord, even though He didn't give them the green light for it."
Leviticus,10,2,"Then the Lord sent out some crazy fire and totally wrecked them, and they were toast in front of the Lord."
Leviticus,10,3,"Yo, Aaron, listen up. This is what the LORD said: 'I'm gonna show My greatness to those who approach Me, and in front of everyone, I'll be glorified.' And Aaron stayed quiet."
Leviticus,10,4,"So Moses was like, 'Yo, Mishael and Elzaphan, you dudes who are Uzziel's sons and Aaron's cousins, come over here. I need you to grab your bros and get them out of the camp away from the sanctuary.'"
Leviticus,10,5,"So they like, approached the place and totally grabbed them undercover, like hiding them in their cool jackets and sneaked them out of the camp, just as Moses had told them to do."
Leviticus,10,6,"Yo, Aaron and his homies Eleazar and Ithamar, listen up! Don't take off your hats or tear your clothes, aight? If you do, you might end up dead and bring God's anger down on everyone. Instead, let your peeps, the whole Israel crew, mourn the fire that the Lord started."
Leviticus,10,7,"Don't dip out of the tabernacle hangout, or you might meet your maker. 'Cause the LORD's holy oil is on you. And they listened up to what Moses said."
Leviticus,10,8,"So, God hit up Aaron and was like,"
Leviticus,10,9,"Yo fam, when you and your squad step into the congregation spot, make sure y'all ain't sippin' on wine or anything strong. It's a forever rule, passed down from generation to generation. If you break it, you might end up dead, so better play it safe!"
Leviticus,10,10,"And so you can tell the difference between what's sacred and what's not, and what's pure and what's impure;"
Leviticus,10,11,"So you can like, pass down all the rules that the LORD told Moses so that the children of Israel know what's up."
Leviticus,10,12,"So Moses was like, 'Yo Aaron, Eleazar, and Ithamar, my boys, grab that leftover meat offering that the LORD was craving, and chow down near the altar, but make sure there's no yeast because it's super sacred and legit."
Leviticus,10,13,"And like, you gotta chow down on it in the sacred spot, because it's like totally yours, and your sons' too, from the offerings that the LORD is all about burning up: 'cause that's what I've been told to tell ya."
Leviticus,10,14,"So, like, make sure to chow down on the wave breast and heave shoulder in a tidy spot, fam. It's all good for you, your squad, and your fam. Cause, ya know, it's what you deserve, like your crew's rightful stuff, that comes from the peace offerings cooked up by the peeps of Israel."
Leviticus,10,15,"They have to bring the heave shoulder and the wave breast along with the fire offerings of the fat, to wave it as an offering before the LORD. It's gonna be yours and your crew's forever, because the LORD said so."
Leviticus,10,16,"So Moses was super determined to find the goat that was sacrificed for the sin, but guess what? It was totally burnt up! He was hella mad at Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's surviving sons, and he shouted at them, saying,"
Leviticus,10,17,"Yo, why haven't y'all chowed down on that sin offering in the holy spot? Like, it's super sacred and God hooked you up with it to take on the wrongdoing of the crew and make things right with the Lord, ya know?"
Leviticus,10,18,"Yo, listen up! The blood wasn't taken into the holy {place}. You were totally supposed to eat it there, just like I commanded, ya know?"
Leviticus,10,19,"So Aaron was like, 'Listen up Moses, today they brought their sin offering and burnt offering before the LORD, and some crazy stuff happened to me. If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it be considered good in the LORD's eyes?"
Leviticus,10,20,"And when Moses found out, he was totally chill with it."
Leviticus,11,1,"So, God was like talking to Moses and Aaron, and here's what He said to them,"
Leviticus,11,2,"Yo, listen up, Israel fam! Check it, these are the animals you're allowed to munch on from all the animals on this planet."
Leviticus,11,3,"You can totally chow down on animals that have split hooves, chew cud, and are all clovenfooted. Yum!"
Leviticus,11,4,"But like, don't eat these animals that chew their food over and over or that have like, split hooves: like camels, for example. They chew their food, but their hooves aren't split, so they're considered unclean for you."
Leviticus,11,5,"And the coney, because it chews the cud but does not divide the hoof, it's considered unclean by you."
Leviticus,11,6,"And like, the hare, 'cause it chews cud and stuff, but doesn't have split hooves, it's, like, totally unclean for you and stuff."
Leviticus,11,7,"So, like, even though pigs have a split hoof and all, they don't chew the cud. Totally unclean, dude."
Leviticus,11,8,"Don't chow down on their meat, and stay away from their dead bodies; they're totally gross and polluted to you."
Leviticus,11,9,"You can totally chow down on all the fish that have fins and scales, whether they're chillin' in the oceans, seas, or rivers."
Leviticus,11,10,"Any sea creature or river-dweller without fins and scales, basically anything swimming around in the waters, is like a total no-go and totally uncool."
Leviticus,11,11,"Bruh, those things are total disgust, like legit abomination. Don't even think about munching on their meat, but straight up treat their dead bodies with utter repulsion."
Leviticus,11,12,"Anything without fins or scales in the water? Like, totally not cool vibes, guys. It's a total abomination, like, seriously. Don't be into that, okay?"
Leviticus,11,13,"And these are the birds you should totally avoid; they're a big no-no: the eagle, the ossifrage, and the ospray. Don't even think about eating them, they're straight-up nasty."
Leviticus,11,14,"And the vulture, and the kite, you know, same species and all;"
Leviticus,11,15,Every raven clings to its own squad;
Leviticus,11,16,"And like, there's this totally rad owl, and this super cool night hawk, and the cuckoo with its unique sound, and the hawk doing its thing, all chillin' and being awesome in their own way."
Leviticus,11,17,"And there were these cool owls: the little owl, the cormorant, and the mighty great owl,"
Leviticus,11,18,"And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,"
Leviticus,11,19,"And like, there's the stork and the heron, they're like totally their own thing, and then there's the lapwing and the bat too."
Leviticus,11,20,"Yo, any birds that crawl on all fours? Yeah, they're totally not cool with me, feel me? It's like, they're a big no-no in my book."
Leviticus,11,21,But you can totally eat any of those rad flying bugs that walk on four legs and have long legs that help them hop around on the ground;
Leviticus,11,22,"These are the ones you can chow down on: the locusts of various types, the bald locusts of their own kind, the beetles of their own kind, and the grasshoppers of their own kind."
Leviticus,11,23,"But, like, all those other flying bugs that crawl with four legs are, like, totally gross and not cool, dude. They're, like, a major freak-out for you, ya know?"
Leviticus,11,24,"And like, if you happen to, um, touch the dead bodies of these things, you'll be totally unclean until the evening. Yeah, just be careful, okay?"
Leviticus,11,25,"If anyone touches any part of a dead animal, they gotta wash their clothes and they'll be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,11,26,"Dude, any animal that doesn't have a split hoof or chew the cud, it's totally uncool for you. If you touch those animals, you'll be uncool too."
Leviticus,11,27,"And anything that walks on its paws, like all kinds of four-legged animals, those are considered uncool to you: if you touch their dead body, you'll be uncool until the evening."
Leviticus,11,28,"If you touch those dead animals, you need to wash your clothes and you'll stay dirty until the evening. Yep, they're totally gross and unclean for you."
Leviticus,11,29,"These little creatures, like, totally won't be cool with you, you know? I'm talking about the weasel, the mouse, and the tortoise family, man."
Leviticus,11,30,"And like, there were also these super cool animals called ferrets, chameleons, lizards, snails, and moles."
Leviticus,11,31,"These are the disgusting creatures that you should avoid: anyone who touches them, even if they're already dead, will be gross until sunset."
Leviticus,11,32,"If anything dead falls on any of these things, they will become unclean. Whether it's a wooden utensil, clothing, animal skin, or a bag - basically anything that's used for something - it has to be washed with water and will remain unclean until evening. Then it will be considered clean again."
Leviticus,11,33,"If any of them falls into a regular container, everything in it becomes unclean and you have to shatter it."
Leviticus,11,34,"Like, any food that gets all wet is like, totally unclean, and any drink in, like, any container that gets all wet is also unclean. So, yeah."
Leviticus,11,35,"And anything that comes into contact with their dead bodies will be considered unclean. Whether it's an oven or a stovetop, it has to be destroyed because it's contaminated and it'll make you unclean too."
Leviticus,11,36,"But like, if a water source has lots of water, it's considered clean. But if anything touches a dead body, it's like totally unclean, dude."
Leviticus,11,37,"If any part of their dead body falls onto any seeds that are being planted, it'll be considered clean."
Leviticus,11,38,"But like, if any water accidentally gets on the plant, and like, any part of a dead animal falls on it, then it's gonna be unclean for you, dude."
Leviticus,11,39,"If any animal that you're allowed to eat dies, whoever touches its dead body will be unclean until the evening."
Leviticus,11,40,"If you chow down on that dead animal, you gotta clean your threads and stay dirty until the end of the day. And if you're carrying around that dead creature, clean your clothes too and stay unclean until the evening."
Leviticus,11,41,"And anything that crawls on the ground is, like, totally gross and disgusting; it's a big no-no to eat it."
Leviticus,11,42,"You can't eat anything that crawls on its belly, or anything that walks on all fours, or anything that has more than four feet among all the crawling creatures on the earth, because they are disgusting."
Leviticus,11,43,"Don't ever let yourselves be tainted by any disgusting creepy stuff, and don't let yourselves get dirty with them either, 'cause that would totally mess you up."
Leviticus,11,44,"Bruh, I'm the LORD your God, so like, you gotta make yourselves pure and be legit holy, 'cause I'm all about that holy life too, you know? And yo, don't mess with any creepy crawlies that roam the earth, okay? Stay clean and chill."
Leviticus,11,45,"Dudes, I'm the LORD who totally rescued you guys from Egypt and became your God. So, you gotta be super holy, just like me. #HolinessGoals"
Leviticus,11,46,"Yo, here's the lowdown on the rules for beasts, birds, all the living creatures that swim in the waters, and those that crawl on the earth:"
Leviticus,11,47,"To distinguish between what's gross and what's rad, and between the animals you can chow down on and the ones you gotta leave alone."
Leviticus,12,1,"Yo, God was like, Mosess, listen up!'"
Leviticus,12,2,"Yo, tell the Israelites this: If a woman gets preggo and has a baby boy, she gotta be considered unclean for a whole week. She gotta follow the same rules as when she's on her period, ya know? Unclean and all."
Leviticus,12,3,"And on the eighth day, they're gonna snip off the extra skin down there."
Leviticus,12,4,"After her period of purification, she must wait for thirty-three days before she can touch anything holy or enter the sacred place."
Leviticus,12,5,"But if she has a baby girl, she'll be considered unclean for two weeks, just like during her period. After that, she must wait for sixty-six days to complete her purification."
Leviticus,12,6,"Once her purification time is over after giving birth to a son or daughter, she should bring a lamb that's a year old as a burnt offering and a young pigeon or turtledove as a sin offering to the entrance of the tabernacle. She must present them to the priest."
Leviticus,12,7,"Yo, who's gonna present it to the LORD and make things right for her, so she can be cleansed from the blood situation? This is the rule for any chick who gives birth, whether it's a boy or a girl."
Leviticus,12,8,"And if she can't afford a lamb, she can bring two turtles or two young pigeons instead. One is for the burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. The priest will make things right for her, and she will be considered clean."
Leviticus,13,1,"So, like, God totally talked to Moses and Aaron. He was all like,"
Leviticus,13,2,"If a dude has some weird stuff going on with his skin, like a bump, a nasty scab, or a funky spot, and it looks like that leprosy thing, he's gotta go see Aaron the priest or one of his sons who are also priests. Yeah, it's like a swelling too, just to be clear."
Leviticus,13,3,"So, like, the priest gotta check out this skin problem, right? If the hair in the infected area is all white and the problem is worse than just on the surface, it's definitely leprosy. The priest will give it a look and, like, declare the person unclean."
Leviticus,13,4,"If there's a white spot on your skin that's not too deep, and the hair there isn't turning white, the priest will quarantine you for seven days."
Leviticus,13,5,"Yo, the priest gotta peep him on the seventh day and check it out, if the infection looks the same and ain't spreading on the skin, then the priest gotta keep him in isolation for another seven days:"
Leviticus,13,6,"And the priest gonna check him again on the seventh day: and, yo, if the rash looks darker but ain't spreading on the skin, the priest gonna say he's clean: it's just a scab. Then he gotta wash his clothes and he good to go."
Leviticus,13,7,"But yo, if the scab starts spreading all over the skin after the priest has checked it for cleansing, then the priest gotta take another look:"
Leviticus,13,8,"And if the priest notices that, like, yo, the scab is spreading on the skin, then the priest gotta be all 'dude, you're unclean, it's totally leprosy'."
Leviticus,13,9,"So, if a guy gets hit with leprosy, he's gotta go see the priest."
Leviticus,13,10,"And the priest will check it out: if the skin has a white bump and the hair turned white, and there's some fresh raw flesh in the bump; it's a sign of a live, active infection."
Leviticus,13,11,"Yo, his skin got that ancient leprosy vibes, and the priest gonna be like, 'Yo, bro, you unclean, but I ain't gonna quarantine you or nothing, just so y'know, 'cause you unclean n' all."
Leviticus,13,12,"Yo, if you got leprosy spreading all over your skin, from head to toe, the priest gonna notice it, no cap."
Leviticus,13,13,"So like, the priest should totally check it out: and woah, if the leprosy has spread all over his body, he'll be declared clean from the disease: it's all turned white, dude! He's in the clear."
Leviticus,13,14,"But if there's a gross skin issue, he's gonna be considered unclean."
Leviticus,13,15,"And the priest will check out the gnarly skin, and say it's unclean: because gnarly skin is totally unclean, dude: it's like leprosy, you know?"
Leviticus,13,16,"If the infected skin heals and becomes white again, they should go see the priest;"
Leviticus,13,17,"So the priest checks him out, and if the infection looks white, then the priest declares him squeaky clean from the infection. He's all clear, no worries."
Leviticus,13,18,"And like, there was this total gross boil on their flesh, even on the skin, but then it like magically got healed, you know?"
Leviticus,13,19,"If a boil appears on the skin and it's white with a red tinge, the person should show it to the priest."
Leviticus,13,20,"And like, if the priest sees it and, whoa, it looks like it's beneath the skin and the hair turns white, the priest will totally say the person is unclean. It's, like, a serious case of leprosy coming from the boil."
Leviticus,13,21,"But yo, if the priest peep it and there ain't no white hairs and it ain't deeper than the skin but kinda dark, then the priest gonna keep them isolated for a whole week:"
Leviticus,13,22,"If it spreads a lot on the skin, the priest will say the person is unclean: it's a plague."
Leviticus,13,23,"But if the TikTok trend stays the same and doesn't go viral, it's just a basic burn, and the priest will say it's all good."
Leviticus,13,24,"Or if someone's skin has a fiery burn with a bright white or somewhat reddish, white spot on it..."
Leviticus,13,25,"So like, the priest gotta check it out, and if the hair in the bright spot is like, totally white and looks deeper than the skin, then it's like a leprosy thingy that comes from a burn or something. That's when the priest says the person is unclean, like it's a legit leprosy situation."
Leviticus,13,26,"But yo, if the priest peep it and sees that there ain't no white hair in the spot that's lit up, and it ain't no different from the rest of the skin, but kinda darker; then the priest gotta put homie on lockdown for seven days:"
Leviticus,13,27,"On the seventh day, the priest checks them out. If there's a lot of spreading on the skin, the priest declares them unclean because it's the nasty leprosy."
Leviticus,13,28,"And if the lit spot stays where it is, and doesn't spread on the skin but kinda darkens, it's just a mild burn, and the priest will declare them clean, because it's just an inflammation from the burn."
Leviticus,13,29,If a dude or chick have a nasty sore on their head or their beard;
Leviticus,13,30,"So like, the priest has to check out the disease, you know? And if it's like, more than just a surface thing, like if it's deep, and there's this weird yellow hair on it, then the priest is all like, 'Dude, you're unclean!' It's this dry scaly thing, like leprosy, on your head or beard."
Leviticus,13,31,"So, like, if the priest checks out this skin issue and sees that it's not too deep, and there's no black hair in it, then he's gonna isolate the person with the issue for a week, okay?"
Leviticus,13,32,"And on day seven, the priest will check out the skin infection. If the scabby patch hasn't gotten bigger and there's no yellow hair in it, and it's not deeper than the surface of the skin,"
Leviticus,13,33,"He gotta shave his head, but he can't touch that scaly patch; and the priest gonna keep the one with the patch locked up for another seven days:"
Leviticus,13,34,"And on the seventh day, the priest will check out the scall and, yo, if the scall hasn't spread on the skin or goes deeper than the skin, then the priest will declare the person clean. They gotta wash their clothes and be clean, ya know."
Leviticus,13,35,"But yo, if that scall keeps spreading all over the skin even after it's been cleansed;"
Leviticus,13,36,"So, like, the priest checks out the person and if the rash has like, spread on the skin, the priest doesn't have to look for blonde hair, cuz that person's unclean, man."
Leviticus,13,37,"But if the rash is still there and has black hair growing in it, the rash has healed and he is good to go. The priest declares him clean."
Leviticus,13,38,"If someone, whether it's a dude or a girl, has these lit white spots on their skin,"
Leviticus,13,39,"So, like, the priest needs to check out these spots on their skin, and if they're kind of like darkish white, then it's just like a cool freckle thing and they're all good, no worries."
Leviticus,13,40,"And the dude whose hair has fallen out, he's bald, but he's legit clean. #freshshave"
Leviticus,13,41,"If someone's hair is falling off from the front of their head, making them forehead bald, they're still considered clean."
Leviticus,13,42,"And yo, if there's like a white reddish sore on the bald head or the bald forehead, that's straight up leprosy popping off in his bald head or his bald forehead."
Leviticus,13,43,"So, like, the priest checks it out, and if there's, like, a white or reddish sore on their bald head or forehead, it's, you know, like leprosy on the skin."
Leviticus,13,44,"He's, like, a super messed up dude, totally unclean: the priest's gonna be all, 'Yeah, he's seriously unclean, no hope for him.' His sickness is like, in his head, you know?"
Leviticus,13,45,"If someone has leprosy, they gotta rip their clothes, go bald, cover their mouth, and yell 'I'm unclean, super unclean!'"
Leviticus,13,46,"Like, for real, any day that he's got that plague, he's totally contaminated and defiled. Gross, right? He's all unclean and stuff. So he's gotta live all by himself, outside the camp. That's where he's gonna stay, you know?"
Leviticus,13,47,"And like, if there's this piece of clothing with leprosy, whether it's made of wool or linen, ya know,"
Leviticus,13,48,"Whether it's in the cool design or the cozy fabric - be it linen or wool, or even some dope leather goods - in whatever fly form it comes, rock it with style and flair. No matter if it's stitched or crafted, make it a masterpiece of creativity."
Leviticus,13,49,"If there's like this green or red blotch on a piece of clothing or your skin or anything made of skin, whether it's like the pattern or the fabric itself, it's most likely leprosy and you gotta go show it to the priest. The word 'thing' in Hebrew means like a vessel or an instrument, by the way."
Leviticus,13,50,And the priest will check out the nasty situation and quarantine the person with the problem for a whole week:
Leviticus,13,51,"And he gotta check out the disease after a whole week: if the disease spread through the clothes, whether in the threads or in the fabric, or even on some animal skin, or anything made of animal skin; then it's a nasty case of leprosy; it's totally unclean."
Leviticus,13,52,"So, like, that outfit has gotta be totally burned if it's made of wool or linen or any kinda animal skin and has some nasty leprosy thing going on. Burn it all up, man!"
Leviticus,13,53,"And if the priest checks it out and sees that the infection hasn't spread on the clothing, whether it's in the threads, fabric, or anything made of leather;"
Leviticus,13,54,"Then the priest will be like, 'Yo, wash that thing where the plague is, and keep it quarantined for another seven days, fam.'"
Leviticus,13,55,"Then the priest will check the skin rash after it has been washed and, look, if the rash hasn't changed color and hasn't spread, then it is considered unclean. You have to burn it up in the fire because it has corroded deep down, whether it's bald on the head or on the forehead."
Leviticus,13,56,"And if the priest checks it out, and, like, sees that the skin condition is still kinda shady even after washing it, then he should totally tear it out of the clothes or the skin or the pattern, ya know?"
Leviticus,13,57,"And if the stain is still on the clothing, whether on the design or the fabric or any kind of material; it's a contagious infection: you need to destroy the affected item by setting it on fire."
Leviticus,13,58,"Yo, check it. If you gotta clean some clothes or whatever, whether it's made of threads or animal skin or whatever, after you've washed it and the disease is gone, you gotta wash it again to make sure it's completely clean."
Leviticus,13,59,"So basically, here's how it goes when it comes to leprosy in clothes, whether it's made of wool, linen, or even animal skin. You either say it's clean or you say it's unclean, following the rules."
Leviticus,14,1,"God was like, yo Moses, listen up!"
Leviticus,14,2,Here's the deal for dealing with a leper who's getting cleansed: they gotta be taken to the priest.
Leviticus,14,3,"So, like, the priest, right? He'll like, leave the whole camp and stuff. And then he's gonna check out the leper, you know? And if the leprosy's all healed and stuff, like, that's a good sign, ya know?"
Leviticus,14,4,"So, the priest tells the person who needs to be purified to gather two birds that are alive and clean, along with some cedar wood, scarlet, and hyssop. You can also use sparrows instead of birds, by the way."
Leviticus,14,5,"Then the priest will be like, 'Yo, take one of them birds and snuff it out in a clay pot with water flowin' through it:'"
Leviticus,14,6,"Now, take the cool bird, along with some cedar wood, scarlet thread, and hyssop. Dip them and the living bird into the blood of the bird that was killed over the flowing water."
Leviticus,14,7,"Then he's gotta sprinkle that dude with the leprosy seven times, say he's all good, and let the bird back into the wild open field."
Leviticus,14,8,"The person getting cleaned up needs to freshen up their outfit, give themselves a clean shave, and take a nice refreshing shower to feel all fresh and clean. Then they can join the group and hang out outside their tent for a whole week."
Leviticus,14,9,"But on the seventh day, he has to like, totally shave all his hair off - head, beard, eyebrows, the whole deal. And not just that, he's gotta wash his clothes and his body in water, you know? Then he'll be all clean and good to go."
Leviticus,14,10,"So, on the 8th day, grab two male lambs that are perfect, no flaws. Also, get one female lamb that's less than a year old, also flawless. Then get a small amount of top-notch flour, mix it with some oil for an offering, and also bring some more oil."
Leviticus,14,11,"And the priest who helps the guy get clean will bring the clean dude, and all that stuff, to the LORD, at the entrance of the cool meeting place:"
Leviticus,14,12,"The priest should nab a dope lamb and offer it as a trespass offering. And don't forget to bring the log of oil, then wave them as a lit wave offering in front of the LORD."
Leviticus,14,13,"And he's gotta kill the lamb in the same spot where he's doin' the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place. 'Cause just like the sin offering is for the priest, the trespass offering is super holy too!"
Leviticus,14,14,"So the priest will take some of the blood from the offering for wrongdoing and put it on the tip of the right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and the big toe of the right foot of the person being purified."
Leviticus,14,15,Then the priest will grab some of the oil and pour it into the palm of his own left hand:
Leviticus,14,16,Then the priest will take some of the oil from his left hand and dip his right finger into it. He will sprinkle the oil seven times in front of the LORD using his finger.
Leviticus,14,17,"The priest gotta take the leftover oil he's got and put a little bit on the right ear, right thumb, and right big toe of the person who needs to be cleansed, right on top of the blood from the trespass offering."
Leviticus,14,18,"And the little bit of oil that's left in the priest's hand, he needs to pour it on the head of the person who needs to be cleansed. Then the priest will do his thing to make things right for that person in front of the LORD."
Leviticus,14,19,"And the priest will flex with the sin offering, to make things right for the person who needs cleaning up from their impurity; and then they'll straight up slay the burnt offering:"
Leviticus,14,20,"So like, the priest will totally put the burnt offering and the meat offering on the altar, you know? And then the priest will like, do this thing to make everything cool and make up for any bad vibes. Then, the person will be all purified and good to go."
Leviticus,14,21,"If he's broke and can't afford it, he can bring one lamb as a peace offering, wave it around to make up for his mistake. He should also bring one-tenth of a deal of fancy flour mixed with oil as a food offering, and a log of oil."
Leviticus,14,22,"And like, get two turtledoves or two young pigeons, you know, whatever he can find. One of them is gonna be for like, making up for sin or whatever, and the other one is gonna be, like, completely burnt up as an offering."
Leviticus,14,23,"And on the eighth day, he gotta bring them to the priest, right at the door of the chill tabernacle, in front of the LORD, to get their cleansing on."
Leviticus,14,24,"Then the priest gotta grab the lamb for the forgiveness offering, and the vial of oil, and like, totally wave them as an offering to the Lord, ya know?"
Leviticus,14,25,"And the dude will slay the lamb for the apology, and the priest will take some of the lamb's blood and dab it on the top of the right ear of the person being cleansed, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the big toe of their right foot."
Leviticus,14,26,"Then the priest gotta pour some oil into the palm of his own left hand, no cap:"
Leviticus,14,27,Then the priest will dab some of the oil from his left hand with his right finger seven times in front of the LORD:
Leviticus,14,28,"And the priest will dab some of the oil he's got in his hand on the top part of the right ear of the person who needs to be purified. He'll also put some on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot, right on the spot where the blood from the sin offering is."
Leviticus,14,29,"And the leftover oil that the priest has, he should apply on the head of the person being purified, to make things right with the LORD."
Leviticus,14,30,"And he should totally offer one of those turtledoves or young pigeons, whatever he can find tbh;"
Leviticus,14,31,"If he wants to make up for his sin, he should bring a sin-offering and a burnt-offering, along with some food. Then the priest can make things right for him in front of the LORD."
Leviticus,14,32,"This is the rule for someone with leprosy, whose hand can't reach what they need to get clean."
Leviticus,14,33,"Yo, the LORD was like, talking to Moses and Aaron, and this is what He said,"
Leviticus,14,34,"Once you guys enter Canaan, the place I'm hooking you up with as your new digs, and I drop a nasty leprosy situation in one of your homes in your hood;"
Leviticus,14,35,"And the person who owns the house will go and inform the priest, like, 'Yo, it kinda looks like there's some crazy stuff going on in this house, like a major problem or something:'"
Leviticus,14,36,"Then the priest is gonna be like, 'Yo, everyone needs to dip from the crib before I step in and check out the situation. We don't want anything in the house getting contaminated. After that, the priest can enter the house and do his thing. Emptying it or getting it ready, you know."
Leviticus,14,37,"And he'll check out the infection, like, if there's this infection happening on the walls of the crib, with some weird looking green or red marks, which are like, lower than the wall, ya know?"
Leviticus,14,38,"After that, the priest bounces out of the crib and seals the door tight for a whole week:"
Leviticus,14,39,"So, like, the priest will come back on the seventh day and check it out, you know? And, like, if the disease has, like, spread on the walls of the house, then yeah, there's a problem."
Leviticus,14,40,"Then the priest will be like, 'Yo, get rid of those gross stones with the plague on them. Just chuck 'em somewhere dirty outside the city, man."
Leviticus,14,41,"And he's gonna make sure the whole crib gets a deep clean, like, everywhere. They're gonna dump all the dust they scrape off outside the city in a gross spot, though. No mess inside, yo."
Leviticus,14,42,"And they're gonna swap out those stones for new ones, ya know? Then they'll grab some fresh mortar and start patching up the house."
Leviticus,14,43,"And if the plague pops up once more in the house, after you've removed the stones, scraped it clean, and put on a fresh coat of paint;"
Leviticus,14,44,"So the priest will come and check it out, and if he sees that the infection has spread throughout the house, then it's a serious case of leprosy in the house and it's considered unclean."
Leviticus,14,45,"And he will totally wreck the whole house, demolishing every single stone, all the wood, and even the mortar. Then he'll haul it all away from the city to some dirty spot."
Leviticus,14,46,"Also, if someone goes into the house while it's shut, they'll be considered unclean until the evening."
Leviticus,14,47,"Anyone chillin' indoors gotta do laundry; same goes for anyone grubbin' in the house, gotta do laundry too."
Leviticus,14,48,"So, like, if the priest checks out the house and sees that the plague hasn't spread, after they've plastered it up and stuff, then the priest will be all like, 'The house is all good, man, the plague is healed.'"
Leviticus,14,49,"So, like, he's gotta grab two birds, some cedar wood, scarlet material, and this herb called hyssop, to clean the house and stuff:"
Leviticus,14,50,And he's gonna take one of the birds and off it goes in like a clay pot full of fresh water:
Leviticus,14,51,"Then he'll grab some cedar wood, hyssop, scarlet, a live bird, and dip them in the blood of the dead bird and running water. After that, he'll sprinkle the house seven times."
Leviticus,14,52,"Then he gotta purify the crib using the bird's blood, running water, a live bird, cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet."
Leviticus,14,53,"But he gotta set free the bird, like, outside the city in, like, wide open spaces, and do this atonement thing for the house, and it'll be all clean and stuff."
Leviticus,14,54,Here's the rundown on how to deal with any type of leprosy or scaly skin issues:
Leviticus,14,55,"And for when a piece of clothing or a house is infected with a bad vibe,"
Leviticus,14,56,And for a bump or rash or any weird skin thing:
Leviticus,14,57,"So like, here's the deal: this is the lowdown on dealing with leprosy. Like, when things are unclean or clean, this is the law you gotta follow. You gotta know what's up in the day when things are unclean and when they're clean, you know?"
Leviticus,15,1,"So, like, the LORD was talking to Moses and Aaron, and He was like,"
Leviticus,15,2,"Yo, listen up, Israelites! So, if any dude has like a gross bodily discharge, he's totally unclean because of it. Gross, huh? Yeah, it's like that."
Leviticus,15,3,"And this is how he becomes unclean when he has a bodily discharge: whether his bodily fluids flow freely or they are blocked, it's what makes him unclean."
Leviticus,15,4,"Any bed the person with the condition lies on is not clean, and anything they sit on is also not clean."
Leviticus,15,5,"If anyone touches their bed, they gotta wash their clothes, take a bath, and stay unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,6,"If someone sat on something that someone with an issue sat on, they gotta wash their clothes, take a bath, and they'll be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,7,"If someone touches the infected person's skin, they gotta wash their clothes, take a shower, and stay unclean until the evening."
Leviticus,15,8,"And if someone with a spitting problem spits on someone who is clean, then they should wash their clothes and take a shower with water, and they will be considered unclean until the evening."
Leviticus,15,9,And any chair that someone with the condition sits on will be considered unclean.
Leviticus,15,10,"And anyone who touches anything that was under them will be unclean until the evening. If someone carries any of those things, they should wash their clothes and take a shower, and they will be unclean until the evening."
Leviticus,15,11,"If he touches someone who has a contagious disease and forgets to wash his hands with water, he needs to clean his clothes and take a full-on water bath. He'll be considered unclean until the evening."
Leviticus,15,12,"If someone with a nasty condition touches something made of clay, it needs to be smashed. And anything made of wood should be washed with water."
Leviticus,15,13,"And once the person who had a bodily discharge has been healed from it, they should wait for seven days as a part of their cleansing process. They should also wash their clothes, take a shower with flowing water, and then they'll be good to go, all clean and fresh."
Leviticus,15,14,"And on the eighth day, he should bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and go before the LORD at the entrance of the tabernacle, and give them to the priest:"
Leviticus,15,15,"Then the priest is gonna offer them, one for like a sin thingy, and the other for like a burnt offering, ya know? And the priest is gonna make everything cool with the Lord for him and his like, issues and stuff."
Leviticus,15,16,"If a guy's stuff comes out, he needs to wash his whole bod with water and stay dirty until evening."
Leviticus,15,17,Any clothes or fabrics with bodily fluids on them need to be washed with water and will remain unclean until evening time.
Leviticus,15,18,"When a dude hooks up with a chick and they do the dirty, they gotta take a quick shower and stay unclean till evening."
Leviticus,15,19,"If a girl is having a menstrual flow and there's blood coming out of her body, she should stay away from others for seven days. Anyone who touches her will be considered impure until the evening."
Leviticus,15,20,"Anything she sits or lies on while she's in her separate time will be considered unclean, including the things she uses."
Leviticus,15,21,"If anyone touches her bed, they gotta wash their clothes, take a shower, and yup, they're gonna be unclean until the evening."
Leviticus,15,22,"If anyone touches anything she sat on, they should wash their clothes, take a shower, and they'll be considered unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,23,"And if it happens to be on her bed or on anything she sits on, when he touches it, he will be considered unclean until the evening."
Leviticus,15,24,"And if anyone hooks up with her and she's on her period, he'll be considered unclean for a week. And the bed they get busy on will also be unclean."
Leviticus,15,25,"And if a girl has a situation where she's bleeding for many days outside the time of her separation, or if it goes on longer than her separation period, then all the days of her being unclean due to the bleeding will be just like her separation days."
Leviticus,15,26,"Any bed she uses during her time of menstruation will be considered her special designated period bed, and anything she sits on will become unclean, just like her menstruation."
Leviticus,15,27,"And whoever touches those things will be like, totally unclean, and must wash their clothes and take a refreshing bath using water, and they'll remain unclean until the evening."
Leviticus,15,28,"But if she is healed from her condition, then she will wait for seven days, and after that she will be considered clean."
Leviticus,15,29,"On day eight, she's supposed to bring two turtles or two young pigeons to the priest, right at the entrance of the tabernacle where everyone gathers."
Leviticus,15,30,The priest gotta bring one animal for a sin offering and another for a burnt offering. Then the priest gotta make things right with the LORD for the lady's uncleanness.
Leviticus,15,31,"So basically, make sure the Israelites keep themselves clean to avoid meeting a grim fate of dying in their impurity. Gotta respect my tabernacle, which is chillin' with them, you know?"
Leviticus,15,32,"Here's the deal for anyone dealing with reproductive health issues and accidentally spreading their seed, making things messy and unconventional;"
Leviticus,15,33,"And for anyone experiencing health issues, whether it's related to menstruation or any other bodily discharge, whether it's a man or a woman, or anyone engaging in activities with someone considered unclean."
Leviticus,16,1,"So, like, after Aaron's two sons offered stuff to the LORD and ended up dying, the LORD started talking to Moses, you know?"
Leviticus,16,2,"God was like, 'Yo Moses, tell your bro Aaron he can't just stroll into the super sacred spot behind the curtain in front of the mercy seat whenever he feels like it. If he does, he's gonna end up dead, because I'mma show up in the cloud right above the mercy seat."
Leviticus,16,3,So Aaron should enter the sacred {spot} with a rad young bull for a sin-offering and a dope ram for a burnt offering.
Leviticus,16,4,"He's gotta put on that fresh holy linen coat, and rock those linen breeches on his bod. Gotta flex that linen girdle and top it off with a linen mitre. Those clothes are hella sacred, so he better cleanse his skin with water before wearing them."
Leviticus,16,5,"So, basically, he's gonna grab two baby goats from the crew of Israelite peeps as a sacrifice for their sins. Oh, and also a ram for a fire sacrifice."
Leviticus,16,6,"And Aaron will need to flex his sin-offering bull, just for himself, and take care of his own business, and his fam too."
Leviticus,16,7,"And he's gonna grab those two goats and bring them over to the LORD, like right outside the tabernacle. It's gonna be lit at the door of the congregation, fam."
Leviticus,16,8,"And Aaron gotta draw straws for the two goats: one for God, and the other one for the scapegoat. Scapegoat, by the way, is Hebrew for Azazel. #randomgoatselect"
Leviticus,16,9,"And Aaron's gonna bring the goat that got picked by the LORD, and offer it as a sin offering. Ya know, the one that got chosen and all."
Leviticus,16,10,"But like, the goat that got picked as the scapegoat, it's gotta be brought in front of the LORD all alive and stuff, to make things right, ya know? And then it's gotta be set free into the wilderness as the official scapegoat."
Leviticus,16,11,"So Aaron is gonna bring this bullock, which is basically a big ol' cow, for the sin offering. He's gotta do this for himself first, and make things right, you know? Not just for himself though, but also for his family. Then, he's gotta take that cow and kill it, 'cause that's the whole point of the sin offering for himself."
Leviticus,16,12,"And he will grab a censer full of fiery coals from the altar in front of the LORD, and his hands full of crushed sweet incense, and carry it inside the curtain:"
Leviticus,16,13,"And, like, he's gonna light up the incense in front of the LORD, so that the smoke hides the mercy seat, you know, the one on top of the testimony, just to make sure he doesn't accidentally, like, bite the dust or anything."
Leviticus,16,14,Then he'll take some of the bull's blood and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy seat towards the east. He'll sprinkle the blood on the mercy seat seven times with his finger.
Leviticus,16,15,"So he'll sacrifice the goat for the sin offering, specifically for the people, and take its blood inside the curtain. He'll treat the goat's blood just like he did with the bull's blood, sprinkling it on the mercy seat and in front of the mercy seat."
Leviticus,16,16,"And he's gonna like, fix the holy {place}, 'cause the guys from Israel have been super dirty and doing all sorts of bad stuff. So, he's gonna do the same for the tabernacle where everyone gathers, 'cause it's still chillin' with them even though they're all dirty."
Leviticus,16,17,"Yo, no one should be up in the tabernacle of the congregation when he's about to go in and do his thing to make things right in the holy spot. He gotta come out first, and make things right for himself, his fam, and the whole congregation of Israel."
Leviticus,16,18,"Then he's gonna head over to the altar in front of the LORD and make things right there, you know? He'll grab some blood from the bull and the goat and spread it on the corners of the altar. It's all about making things right and cleansing, you dig?"
Leviticus,16,19,"Then he's gonna sprinkle the blood on it seven times with his finger, making it all clean and sacred, getting rid of all the icky stuff that made it impure from the Israelite squad."
Leviticus,16,20,"And once he's finished making everything in the holy {place}, and the gathering spot, and the altar all good again, he's gonna bring in the live goat:"
Leviticus,16,21,"So Aaron will put both his hands on the head of the goat that's still alive, and he'll admit all the wrongdoings and sins of the people of Israel. Then, he'll place all that guilt on the goat's head and have a capable guy lead the goat away into the wild-lands. (And just so you know, that capable guy is like, the right person at the right time!)"
Leviticus,16,22,"And the goat, like, totally gonna carry all their bad stuff, you know, to this deserted place and then just set it free. Wild, right? 🔥"
Leviticus,16,23,So Aaron's gonna step into the tabernacle hangout spot and take off his fancy linen clothes that he wore when he went to the super sacred place and leave 'em there.
Leviticus,16,24,"Then he gotta clean himself up with water in this holy spot, put on his fresh clothes, step outside, and make his burnt offering for himself and the rest of the people to make things right."
Leviticus,16,25,"And he's gotta like, totally roast the fatty part of the sin offering on the altar, no cap."
Leviticus,16,26,"The person who releases the goat as the scapegoat needs to wash their clothes, cleanse their body with water, and then return to the camp."
Leviticus,16,27,"The bullock and the goat, which were sacrificed to make up for our wrongdoings, must be taken outside the camp and burned, including their skin, flesh, and dung."
Leviticus,16,28,"And the person who burns them should wash their clothes and clean themselves in water, and only then may they return to the camp."
Leviticus,16,29,"Yo, here's the deal: this is gonna be a never-ending rule for y'all. On the seventh month, specifically the tenth day, you gotta lay low and take a break – no workin' at all. And I mean everyone, whether you're from here or just visiting."
Leviticus,16,30,"Because, like dude, on that day, the priest will totally hook you up with an atonement that will cleanse you, so you can be, like, super clean from all your sins in front of the LORD, you know?"
Leviticus,16,31,"It's like a chill day off for you, where you don't stress out and just take it easy, totally intentionally, forever."
Leviticus,16,32,"And the priest, who he will choose and dedicate to serve as a priest in place of his father, will make amends and wear the special holy clothes, also known as the 'fill his hand' garments."
Leviticus,16,33,"And he's gotta do this whole atonement thing for the holy sanctuary, the tabernacle where everyone gathers, the altar, the priests, and like, every single person in the whole congregation, you know?"
Leviticus,16,34,"So this is gonna be a forever rule for you, like a tradition, to make up for all the wrong stuff the Israelites do once a year. And yeah, the dude totally followed what the LORD told Moses to do."
Leviticus,17,1,"So God like, totally talked to Moses, right? He was all like, 'Yo, Moses, listen up!'"
Leviticus,17,2,"Yo, Aaron, his sons, and all y'all Israelites, listen up! God's got a message for you, so pay attention:"
Leviticus,17,3,"If any dude from the house of Israel decides to slaughter an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp or outside the camp,"
Leviticus,17,4,"If you don't take the offering to the entrance of the place where we all gather to worship the Lord, your actions will be seen as shedding blood. Basically, you'll be kicked out of the community."
Leviticus,17,5,"So that the Israelites can bring their sacrifices, which they do in the open field, and bring them to the LORD, at the entrance of the sacred tent where the meetings take place, to the priest, and offer them as peace offerings to the LORD."
Leviticus,17,6,"The priest gonna spray that blood on the LORD's altar, right by the door of the tabernacle where everyone gathers, then burn that fat to make the LORD happy."
Leviticus,17,7,"And they won't worship those fake idols anymore, because they've been messing around with them. This rule will always apply to them, forever and ever."
Leviticus,17,8,"So, like, when you gotta talk to them, just be like, if there's any dude from the fam of Israel or any outsiders chillin' with you, and they wanna bring some fire offerings or sacrifices,"
Leviticus,17,9,"If someone doesn't take their offering to the door of the hangout spot where God is chillin', they're gonna be totally banned from their crew."
Leviticus,17,10,"And if any dude from the gang of Israel, or even a stranger staying in the hood, chows down on any kind of blood, I'll straight up bring the heat on that person and kick them out of the squad."
Leviticus,17,11,"Yo, listen up! Life itself depends on blood, like it's the real deal. And I've totally given it to you to do some soul-cleansing on the altar. Yeah, blood is what really does the trick when it comes to making things right with your soul."
Leviticus,17,12,"So, listen up, peeps of Israel! I'm telling you straight up, none of y'all should be chowing down on that blood. And for all the visitors in your hood, same rules apply - no blood on their plates either."
Leviticus,17,13,"If any dude from the fam of Israel or even any random peeps chilling with us goes out and hunts down some tasty animals or birds, he's gotta pour out the blood and give it a dust covering. Like, keep it clean and respectful, ya know?"
Leviticus,17,14,"So, like, the life of all living things is in their blood, you know? That's why I told the kids of Israel not to eat any flesh with the blood still in it. 'Cause, like, the life of all living things is in the blood, man. If anyone goes against that and eats it, they're totally out of the game."
Leviticus,17,15,"If anyone eats something that died on its own or was torn by animals, whether they are from your own community or a stranger, they must wash their clothes, take a shower, and remain unclean until evening. After that, they will be clean."
Leviticus,17,16,"But like, if he doesn't wash or bathe his body, then he's gonna have to take responsibility for his own wrongdoings, you know?"
Leviticus,18,1,"Yo, God hit up Moses with a message,"
Leviticus,18,2,"Yo, listen up, guys! This is a message for all the Israelites. So, like, hear me out. I'm the Almighty, the God who's got your back."
Leviticus,18,3,"Yo, don't be doing the same messed up stuff the Egyptians used to do when you were living there. And when I bring you to the land of Canaan, don't start copying their messed up ways either. Don't follow their laws and customs, man."
Leviticus,18,4,"Make sure to follow my rules, and always keep my commandments, living accordingly. Just so you know, I am the LORD your God."
Leviticus,18,5,"So like, you gotta obey all my rules and decisions, okay? 'Cause if you do, you'll have a totally awesome life with me, the LORD."
Leviticus,18,6,"Yo, don't get with fam members to see them in the buff. That's a no-go, I'm the LORD. #boundaries"
Leviticus,18,7,"You gotta respect your parents and not expose their private stuff. Your mom's off-limits, so don't go spreading her private business around."
Leviticus,18,8,"Don't do anything inappropriate with your dad's wife – that's just wrong, dude."
Leviticus,18,9,"You can't expose the nudity of your sibling, whether they're your dad's daughter or your mom's daughter, whether they're born in the same house or outside. It's a no-no to reveal their nakedness."
Leviticus,18,10,Don't go exposing the bodies of your granddaughter or your great-granddaughter. That's just as bad as exposing yourself. Keep it covered!
Leviticus,18,11,"If your dad has a step-daughter from his wife and she's your sister, don't be creeping on her, okay? Keep it respectful and don't expose her nakedness, fam."
Leviticus,18,12,"Yo, don't be checking out or getting with your dad's sister, 'cause she's like family and that's not cool."
Leviticus,18,13,"Don't go around exposing your mom's sister's private stuff, 'cause she's practically family, ya know?"
Leviticus,18,14,"Don't mess with your uncle by getting involved with his wife, that's just plain wrong. She's your aunt, man."
Leviticus,18,15,"Don't be creeping on your daughter-in-law, she's your son's wifey. Keep it respectful and don't be exposing her like that."
Leviticus,18,16,"Don't go exposing your brother's wife, dude. It's like totally stepping into your bro's private territory."
Leviticus,18,17,"Don't be out here revealing the private stuff of a woman and her daughter, and don't be messing around with her granddaughters either. That's her fam, and it's totally not cool."
Leviticus,18,18,"Don't even think about marrying your girl's sister just to annoy her and see her naked, while she's still alive. Like, seriously, don't even go there. Keep it classy, bro."
Leviticus,18,19,"And you better not even think about getting close to a girl and seeing her naked, for as long as she's kept separate due to her impurity."
Leviticus,18,20,"And don't hook up with your neighbor's spouse, it's not cool and totally not worth it."
Leviticus,18,21,"Yo, don't be sacrificing your kids to Molech or disrespecting the name of God, alright? I'm the LORD, just so you know. (BTW, Molech means Moloch in Greek)"
Leviticus,18,22,"Don't hook up with guys if you're a guy, it's totally not cool. It's considered like a major no-no."
Leviticus,18,23,"Don't hook up with animals, that's nasty. And no girl should be getting freaky with animals either. It's just all messed up, man."
Leviticus,18,24,"Don't mess yourself up by doing any of these things, because all the other nations messed themselves up and I had to kick them out:"
Leviticus,18,25,"And the land is totally messed up: so I'm like, yeah, I'm gonna hold it accountable for all the bad stuff happening and the land itself is just like, 'nope', and throws out all the people living there."
Leviticus,18,26,"So, like, you gotta follow all the rules and laws that I've given you, and you absolutely cannot do any of these disgusting things. And I mean, seriously, this applies to everyone, whether they're a part of your own people or a stranger living in your community. No exceptions, guys!"
Leviticus,18,27,"Yo, listen up, cuz the dudes in this land before you totally messed up and did all sorts of messed up things, making the whole place super contaminated and gross."
Leviticus,18,28,"So, like, don't be grossed out, but if you mess up the land by making it dirty and stuff, it might kick you out, just like it did with the previous peeps before you."
Leviticus,18,29,"If anyone does any of these terrible things, even those who do them will be excluded from their community."
Leviticus,18,30,"So make sure to follow my rules, and don't engage in any of these disgusting practices that were done by people before you. Don't taint yourselves with them. I'm the LORD your God."
Leviticus,19,1,"God hit up Moses like,"
Leviticus,19,2,"Yo, peep this, fam! Listen up, all the homies in the Israel crew. God's holla'n at ya, say'n 'Yo, y'all gotta keep it holy, 'cause I, the LORD your God, I'm all about that holiness.'"
Leviticus,19,3,"You gotta show mad respect to your moms and dads and keep it chill on the sabbaths - I'm the real deal, the LORD your God."
Leviticus,19,4,"Don't get caught up with idols or create your own trendy gods, fam. I'm the OG, the LORD your God."
Leviticus,19,5,"And if you wanna flex by offering a chill sacrifice to the LORD, go for it whenever you feel like it, no pressure."
Leviticus,19,6,"You gotta chow down on that sacrificial offering right away, like, same day and next day. But yo, if there's anything left till the third day, you gotta roast that stuff up in the fire, no leftovers allowed."
Leviticus,19,7,"And like, if you eat it at all on the third day, it's like totally gross and unacceptable, dude. Just no."
Leviticus,19,8,"So, like, if anyone eats that thing, they'll, like, totally be held responsible for their wrongdoing, 'cause they disrespect the sacred thing of the LORD, you know? And that person will totally be kicked out from their gang."
Leviticus,19,9,"When you gather the crops from your land, don't completely take all the crops from the edges of your field, and don't collect every last bit of the harvested crops."
Leviticus,19,10,"Don't be greedy with your vineyard, okay? Like, don't pick all the grapes. Leave some for those in need, whether they're poor or strangers. Just remember, I'm the LORD your God, so be kind and generous."
Leviticus,19,11,"Don't swipe stuff that isn't yours, don't front or be fake, and don't fib to your squad."
Leviticus,19,12,"Don't be fake when using my name, and don't disrespect your God's name. I'm the LORD, FYI."
Leviticus,19,13,"Don't scam or steal from your homie, and don't keep a worker's paycheck overnight, give it to them immediately."
Leviticus,19,14,"Don't be dissing the deaf or trippin' up the blind, bro. Just respect God, you know? 'Cause I'm the LORD."
Leviticus,19,15,"When judging others, make sure you don't play favorites based on their social status. Treat everyone fairly and with integrity, regardless of whether they're rich or poor. Always strive to be just and impartial when making judgments."
Leviticus,19,16,"Don't go spreading rumors and gossip amongst your peeps, and don't stand in the way of helping out your neighbor when they're in need. Just a heads-up, I'm the LORD, so you better stay in line."
Leviticus,19,17,"Don't harbor any hate for your bro deep down inside. If you see your neighbor messing up, call them out and help them avoid sin. Don't let sin stick to them, ya feel?"
Leviticus,19,18,"Don't seek revenge or hold grudges against your peeps, but treat your neighbor as you treat yourself. I'm the LORD, by the way."
Leviticus,19,19,"You gotta follow my rules, okay? Don't let your animals crossbreed, like seriously, keep them from mixin' it up. And when you plant crops, stick to one type of seed, none of that mixed stuff, alright? And don't even think about wearing clothes made of both linen and wool, that's a big no-no!"
Leviticus,19,20,"If anyone has sexual relations with a woman who is a servant, engaged to be married but not set free yet, they shall be punished, but not with death, since she is not free. The punishment shall be a beating, because she has been mistreated."
Leviticus,19,21,"And he's gotta bring his trespass offering to the LORD, right at the door of the tabernacle where everyone gathers, you know? Like, a ram. That's what he's supposed to bring for his trespass offering."
Leviticus,19,22,"And the priest is gonna hook him up with a ram as a peace offering to make things right with the LORD for the screw-up he did. Once that's done, his wrongdoing will be totally forgiven."
Leviticus,19,23,"So when you finally settle in the land and have planted all kinds of food-producing trees, remember this: for the first three years, consider the fruit off-limits, like it's not ready yet. Don't eat it just yet."
Leviticus,19,24,"But in the fourth year, all the fruit from the tree should be set aside to give thanks to the LORD. It's all about praising Him!"
Leviticus,19,25,"And like, in the fifth year, you can totally feast on the fruit, so that it gives you mad good vibes and, yo, abundance, you know? 'Cause, like, I'm the LORD your God and all that."
Leviticus,19,26,"Don't chow down on anything with the blood, and stay far away from magical stuff and time-watching."
Leviticus,19,27,Don't shave or trim the edges of your head or mess up the corners of your beard.
Leviticus,19,28,"You shouldn't carve yourself or get any tattoos as a way to honor the deceased. Remember, I'm the LORD."
Leviticus,19,29,"Don't sell out your daughter and make her a prostitute; if you do, the whole land will become full of immorality and wickedness."
Leviticus,19,30,"Make sure you respect my chill downtime and treat my sacred place with mad reverence, because I'm the LORD, you know?"
Leviticus,19,31,"Don't hang out with people who mess with spirits or try to be all magical, it's not cool and you'll just end up feeling dirty. I'm the real deal, the boss, the LORD your God."
Leviticus,19,32,"Respect your elders, man! Give props to those wise old souls, and show reverence to your God. I'm the one and only, the LORD."
Leviticus,19,33,"If a random person, like, stays in your hood, you gotta treat 'em with respect. Can't be hatin' or puttin' 'em down or anything, ya know? Like, be chill and show some love, man. No need to cause trouble or be mean. That's not cool."
Leviticus,19,34,"Treat the outsider chillin' with you like part of the crew, show 'em love like they're one of your own, 'cause, bro, back in the day, we were strangers in Egypt. Just a reminder, I'm the LORD your God, so keep it real."
Leviticus,19,35,"Don't be unfair when making decisions or sizing things up, whether it's using a measuring tape, a scale, or any kind of measurement."
Leviticus,19,36,"You gotta have fair scales, fair measurements, a fair container, and a fair liquid measure, okay? Because I'm the LORD your God who rescued you from Egypt. Just sayin', y'know. #NoCheating #Grateful"
Leviticus,19,37,"So, like, you gotta follow all my rules, and make sure you do everything I say, you know? 'Cause I'm the LORD and all that. No biggie."
Leviticus,20,1,"So, God was like, yo Moses, listen up,"
Leviticus,20,2,"Once again, tell all the people of Israel, whether they're from Israel or just visiting, that if anyone sacrifices their child to Molech, they're gonna pay the ultimate price. The people of the land will gather round and stone them to death."
Leviticus,20,3,"And I'll totally be against that dude, like I'm cutting him off from his squad. It's because he went and offered his kids to Molech, like straight up defiling my sacred place and disrespecting my holy name."
Leviticus,20,4,And if the peeps out there totally ignore it when someone sacrifices their child to Molech and don't do anything about it:
Leviticus,20,5,"So, like, I'm totally gonna be super mad at that guy and his whole fam and I'm gonna, like, completely cut them off. And anyone who's, like, following his bad vibes and doing all that shady stuff with Molech, they gotta bounce too from their crew."
Leviticus,20,6,"And if someone starts chasing after people who claim to commune with spirits or practice wizardry, going after them like they're dating, I will personally be totally against that person, and they will be completely excluded from their community."
Leviticus,20,7,"Yo, make yourselves pure and live with mad integrity, 'cause I'm your God, fam."
Leviticus,20,8,"And you gotta follow my rules, like actually do them: I'm the LORD and I make you holy."
Leviticus,20,9,Anyone who disrespects their parents is seriously in trouble. It's like they're bringing death upon themselves because they've disrespected their own parents. They've got no one to blame but themselves.
Leviticus,20,10,"If a dude cheats with someone else's girl, whether it's his bro's girl or his neighbor's girl, both the cheater and the cheatee gotta face the ultimate consequence - death penalty, no joke!"
Leviticus,20,11,"If anyone hooks up with his dad's ex, they're totally exposing their dad's private business. Both of 'em are gonna get straight up eliminated, their actions are on their own heads, no one else's."
Leviticus,20,12,"If a dude hooks up with his ex's daughter, they're both getting wiped out. They totally messed things up and it's all on them, man."
Leviticus,20,13,"If a guy hooks up with another guy like he does with a girl, it's considered totally messed up: they need to face the consequences and it's on them."
Leviticus,20,14,"If a dude marries both a girl and her mom, that's absolutely messed up: they gotta be burned alive, both of them, no exceptions. It's all about keeping things clean and righteous, no wickedness allowed in our crew."
Leviticus,20,15,"If someone engages in intimate relationships with an animal, they will definitely face capital punishment, and the animal involved will also be put to death."
Leviticus,20,16,"If anyone engages in inappropriate relations with an animal, the consequences are severe: both the person and the animal must be put to death. They will face the consequences of their actions, and justice will be served."
Leviticus,20,17,"If a guy ever hooks up with his sister (his dad or mom's daughter) and they start getting all naked together, that's super messed up. People will totally disown them for that, 'cause exposing your sister like that is just not cool. They gotta deal with the consequences of breaking the rules, 'cause that's on them."
Leviticus,20,18,"If a dude hooks up with a girl who's on her period and exposes her nakedness, he's messing with her flow and she's revealing her menstrual cycle. They both gotta be expelled from their community."
Leviticus,20,19,"You can't hook up with your mom's sister or your dad's sister, 'cause that's just getting it on with close family. They'll have to deal with the consequences of their actions, ya know?"
Leviticus,20,20,"If a dude hooks up with his uncle's wife, he's exposing his uncle's private stuff. They'll face the consequences and won't have any kids."
Leviticus,20,21,"If a dude starts dating his bro's ex, it's not cool, man. He's breaking the bro code and disrespecting his bro's boundaries. They won't be able to have any kids together. It's just not right, ya know?"
Leviticus,20,22,"So, like, make sure you follow all of my rules and do what I say, okay? That way, when you move to the land I'm taking you to, you won't get kicked out or anything. Stay cool, bro."
Leviticus,20,23,"And don't copy the ways of the people I kicked out before you, cause they were doing all sorts of messed up stuff and I couldn't stand them."
Leviticus,20,24,"But yo, listen up fam, I already told y'all that you're gonna get their land and I'm gonna hook you up with it. It's gonna be lit, like a sick spot that's flowing with mad milk and honey. Just remember, I'm the LORD your God, and I've set you apart from all them other peeps out there."
Leviticus,20,25,"So, like, you gotta remember to distinguish between the animals that are considered clean and the ones that are considered unclean, you know? Also, make sure to tell the difference between the birds that are clean and the ones that are unclean. And, like, don't do anything that would make your souls icky or disgusting by messing with any unclean animals, birds, or any of those creepy-crawly things on the ground. Back then, I decided they were unclean, so, yeah."
Leviticus,20,26,"And you gotta be straight up sacred to me: 'cause I, the LORD, am sacred and like, I've totally set you apart from everyone else, so you could be like, totally mine."
Leviticus,20,27,"If anyone, male or female, practices witchcraft or claims to have supernatural powers, they will face severe consequences. They will be subjected to stoning, and their fate will be their own responsibility."
Leviticus,21,1,"Yo, listen up, Moses. Go talk to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and tell them this: None of them should mess with dead bodies and get themselves defiled among their peeps."
Leviticus,21,2,"But for his squad, like, the fam that's close to him - you know, his mom, dad, sibling, bros and sis,"
Leviticus,21,3,"And for his sister, a virgin who is close to him and has not been married, he may choose to be intimate with her."
Leviticus,21,4,"But he shouldn't do anything that goes against his reputation, since he's a well-respected person among his crew. He's gotta keep his dignity intact. (Or ya know, if he's married, he shouldn't do anything that would dishonor himself for his wifey and stuff.)"
Leviticus,21,5,They're not supposed to go bald or shave the edges of their beard or make any cuts on their skin.
Leviticus,21,6,"They gotta be totally dedicated to their God, and never diss their God's name. 'Cause they're the ones bringing the lit offerings to the LORD and munching on that holy bread. So, yeah, they gotta stay super holy."
Leviticus,21,7,"They shouldn't marry someone who is promiscuous or disrespectful, and they shouldn't marry a divorced woman. It's because they are dedicated to serving their God."
Leviticus,21,8,"So, like, you gotta make him all holy and stuff, 'cause he's the one serving up the bread for your God. He's gotta be real sacred to you, 'cause I, the LORD, am the one who makes you all holy and stuff."
Leviticus,21,9,"If a priest's daughter disrespects herself by engaging in promiscuous behavior, she dishonors her father and must face the consequence of being punished by fire."
Leviticus,21,10,"The high priest, you know, the one who got that anointing oil poured on his head and is all set to put on those cool garments, is not allowed to show off his head or rip his clothes, fam."
Leviticus,21,11,He can't touch dead bodies or defile himself even for his parents;
Leviticus,21,12,"He can't leave the holy place and disrespect the sacredness of his God's sanctuary because he's got the anointing oil on him, representing his special position. I am the LORD."
Leviticus,21,13,And he's gonna find himself a wifey who's pure as ice.
Leviticus,21,14,"He can't marry a widow, divorced woman, someone who disrespects or a bad girl, but he can marry a virgin from his own crew."
Leviticus,21,15,"He must not disrespect his offspring among his squad, 'cause yo, I, the LORD, gonna bless him."
Leviticus,21,16,"So, God was like, 'Hey Moses, listen up,'"
Leviticus,21,17,"Yo Aaron, listen up. If any of your descendants got some flaws, tell 'em to step back and not bring no bread to offer to God."
Leviticus,21,18,"Anyone with imperfections, like being blind, lame, having a flat nose, or any other physical abnormality, should not come forward."
Leviticus,21,19,"Or like, someone who's got a messed up foot or a messed up hand,"
Leviticus,21,20,"Or someone with a hunchback or someone who's short, or someone with an eye problem, or someone with a skin condition, or someone with scars, or someone who's had a rough time down there."
Leviticus,21,21,"Dude, anyone who's got any kind of flaw from the family of Aaron, the priest, can't come close to offer the offerings of the LORD that are burned up. If he's got a flaw, he can't come close to offer God's bread, period."
Leviticus,21,22,"He's gonna chow down on God's bread, like the super legit holy stuff and the kinda holy stuff too."
Leviticus,21,23,"Yo, they can't go near the vail or altar if they got any blemish. Gotta keep my sanctuaries holy, 'cause I'm the LORD and I'm the one who makes 'em sacred."
Leviticus,21,24,"So Moses was like, hey Aaron and his sons, and yo all the Israelite peeps, listen up, I got something to tell ya."
Leviticus,22,1,"Yo, God straight up talked to Moses, like,"
Leviticus,22,2,"Yo, Aaron and his sons, listen up! I'm telling ya, keep yourselves away from the sacred stuff of the Israelites. Don't go disrespecting my holy name by messing with the things that are dedicated to me. I'm the LORD, by the way."
Leviticus,22,3,"Tell them that anyone from your crew, no matter which gen they come from, who messes with the sacred stuff that the Israelites dedicate to the LORD while being unclean, will be totally out of my presence. Just so you know, I'm the LORD."
Leviticus,22,4,"If any dude from the Aaron fam is dealing with leprosy or some gross running thing, he can't chow down on holy stuff until he gets himself cleaned up. Also, if anyone touches something dirty because of a dead body or a guy who's got some weird stuff coming out, you gotta stay away too."
Leviticus,22,5,"Like, if you touch some gross creepy creature or come in contact with a dude who's all unclean, whatever kind of unclean stuff he's got going on;"
Leviticus,22,6,"If your soul comes in contact with any of these things, you're gonna be unclean until the evening and you can't munch on the holy stuff unless you clean yourself up with some water."
Leviticus,22,7,"And when it's dark outside, he'll be good to go and can eat the sacred stuff as his grub."
Leviticus,22,8,"Don't eat anything that died on its own or was killed by animals, or else you'll make yourself impure. I'm the LORD."
Leviticus,22,9,"So, like, they gotta follow my rules, ya know? Otherwise, they'll take on the sin and end up dead. And if they disrespect it, it's like a major deal, okay? I, the LORD, am the one who makes 'em all sacred and stuff."
Leviticus,22,10,"No random person can munch on the sacred stuff: only a chill non-local friend of the priest, or someone working for them, can snack on the sacred stuff."
Leviticus,22,11,"But if the priest pays for someone's soul with his own cash, he can dig into the grub, as well as those who were born in his crib. They all get a taste of the meal he buys. (BTW, that thing in curly braces means 'with the money he spent on it')."
Leviticus,22,12,"If the priest's daughter gets hitched to someone outside the fam, she can't chow down on the sacred offerings. And by 'someone outside the fam,' I mean some random dude she barely knows. 🚫🍽️"
Leviticus,22,13,"But like, if the priest's daughter becomes single again or gets a divorce, and she doesn't have any kids, and she goes back to live with her dad, just like when she was young, she can totally eat her dad's food, but no random person can eat it."
Leviticus,22,14,"If someone accidentally eats something holy, they should give the priest a fifth of it as compensation."
Leviticus,22,15,And they shall not disrespect the sacred stuff the Israelites offer to the LORD;
Leviticus,22,16,"Don't let them take on the guilt of doing wrong when they eat sacred things. 'Cause I, the LORD, make them holy."
Leviticus,22,17,"God talked to Moses, like,"
Leviticus,22,18,"Yo, Aaron and his homies, listen up! This message goes out to all the peeps in Israel, whether you're part of the fam or just visiting. If you wanna make a dope offering to the LORD, whether it's a promise you made or a freewill offering, here's what you gotta do."
Leviticus,22,19,"You gotta bring a flawless dude from cows, sheep, or goats whenever you feel like it."
Leviticus,22,20,"Yo, anything that's messed up, you can't be bringin' that as an offering 'cause it ain't gonna be cool with the big man upstairs."
Leviticus,22,21,"And if someone wants to bring a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD to fulfill their vow, or a voluntary offering of cattle or sheep, it has to be flawless and in perfect condition to be accepted; there should be no defects in it."
Leviticus,22,22,"If your animal is blind, injured, disabled, has a weird growth, has a skin condition, or is covered in sores, don't bring it as an offering to the LORD or burn it on the altar!"
Leviticus,22,23,"If the animal you're planning to offer as a freewill offering has any extra or missing parts, like a bullock or a lamb, it won't be accepted if it's for a vow. You can also offer a kid instead of a lamb if you want."
Leviticus,22,24,"Don't even think about presenting anything to the LORD that's all banged up, squished, shattered, or sliced. And don't even try making any offerings like that in your turf."
Leviticus,22,25,"Yo, don't even think about offering up some janky bread from some random person to God. That stuff is probably messed up, all full of flaws and imperfections. It ain't gonna pass as good enough for Him, trust me."
Leviticus,22,26,"And God was like, 'Yo Moses, listen up,'"
Leviticus,22,27,"When a lit bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, comes into the world, it's gotta chill with its mom for a solid seven days. Then on the eighth day and after, it's ready to be lit AF and offered up in fire to the LORD."
Leviticus,22,28,"Yo, don't be slaying both a cow or an ewe and their offspring on the same day, fam. No need to take out the whole fam, ya feel me? And by ewe, I mean a she goat, just so you know. Keep it chill and spread the love, bro."
Leviticus,22,29,"And when you want to give thanks to the LORD, offer it however you want."
Leviticus,22,30,"Eat it all that day, no leftovers till tomorrow. I'm the LORD, FYI."
Leviticus,22,31,"So, like, you gotta follow my commandments and actually do them, you know? I'm the LORD, by the way."
Leviticus,22,32,"Yo, don't disrespect my holy name, yo. I wanna be respected and revered by the whole squad of Israelites, aight? I'm the LORD, I'm the one who makes y'all sacred, ya feel me?"
Leviticus,22,33,That rescued you from Egypt to be your God: I'm the LORD.
Leviticus,23,1,"So, God starts talking to Moses like,"
Leviticus,23,2,"Yo, tell the squad of Israelites that the LORD wants them to know about these lit celebrations, called holy convocations. They're straight up the LORD's parties, fam."
Leviticus,23,3,"Yo, listen up! You gotta hustle for six days straight, but on the seventh day, it's time to chillax and have a lit gathering. No work allowed, bro! This day is all about resting and connecting with the big man upstairs, no matter where you're at in this world."
Leviticus,23,4,"These are the lit celebrations of the LORD, like totally sacred get-togethers, that you gotta announce when the time is right."
Leviticus,23,5,"On the fourteenth day of the first month, when the sun goes down, it's time for the LORD's passover."
Leviticus,23,6,"Yo, listen up fam! On the fifteenth day of the same month, we gotta celebrate the feast of unleavened bread for the LORD. It's gonna be lit for a whole week, so you gotta chow down on that unleavened bread, no cap."
Leviticus,23,7,"On the first day, you gotta have a lit gathering: no adulting allowed, just chillax and enjoy the vibes."
Leviticus,23,8,"But like, for real, you gotta bring some lit fire offering to the Lord for seven days straight. And on the seventh day, it's gonna be totally holy, fam. No working like a slave on that day, okay?"
Leviticus,23,9,"And God was like, talking to Moses and stuff, and this is what He said,"
Leviticus,23,10,"Yo, listen up, Israel squad! When you finally enter the lit land that I'm hooking you up with and start reaping those juicy crops, make sure you bring a juicy first batch to the priest. It's like the MVP of your harvest, ya feel me? But fo' real, it's all about that omer, aka a handful of blessings!"
Leviticus,23,11,"And he's gonna be like, waving that sheaf in front of the LORD, to be like, 'Yo, this is cool with us.' And he gotta do it the day after the sabbath, you know, when the priest does the whole waving thing."
Leviticus,23,12,"On that day, when you lift up the sheaf, you gotta offer a rad lamb, totally flawless and one year old, as a lit sacrifice to the Lord."
Leviticus,23,13,"And the food offering should be two tenths of fine flour mixed with oil, a lit offering for the LORD that's absolutely fire: and the drink offering should be wine, one fourth of a hin."
Leviticus,23,14,"And you won't be munching on bread, roasted grains, or fresh corn until you've made a nice offering to your God. This rule is gonna stick around forever, so make sure you remember it in all the places you call home."
Leviticus,23,15,"And you gotta start counting from the day after the chill sabbath, like when you first made that wave offering with the sheaf. Gotta count seven complete sabbaths, okay?"
Leviticus,23,16,"Count fifty days, starting from the day after the seventh sabbath, and bring a fresh offering to the LORD."
Leviticus,23,17,"Yo, take two bomb-a** loaves made with dope flour from your crib. Don't forget to add some leaven to make them legit. These loaves are some next-level offering to the Lord, representing the firstfruits."
Leviticus,23,18,"And you gotta bring seven flawless lambs, only one-year-old, along with a young bull and two rams. They're gonna be like a lit burnt offering to the LORD, with some dope bread, drink, and fire that smells hella good to the LORD."
Leviticus,23,19,"Yo, like sacrifice a goat kid for the sin redemption vibes, and two baby lambs for a chill peace sacrifice. 🐐✌️"
Leviticus,23,20,"And the priest gonna flex them along with the fresh bread, like a lit wave offering to the LORD, with the two lambs: they gotta be straight up holy for the priest, ya feel?"
Leviticus,23,21,"And on that same day, you're supposed to make it a special gathering for yourself. Don't do any sort of work that day – it's gonna be a forever rule for all of you, everywhere you live, for all of time."
Leviticus,23,22,"When you're gathering your crops, don't be all like super neat and stuff by clearing out every last bit at the corners of your field. Also, don't snatch up every little leftover piece when you're harvesting. You gotta leave those for the poor and the outsiders in your land. Just so you know, I'm like the LORD, your God, and I'm sayin' this!"
Leviticus,23,23,"So, God talked to Moses and was like,"
Leviticus,23,24,"Yo, listen up, Israel fam! Come the seventh month, on the first day, it's time to chillax and have a lit Sabbath. We gonna make some noise with the trumpets, and get everyone together for a dope and sacred gathering."
Leviticus,23,25,"Don't do any basic work on that day, but make sure to offer a lit offering to the LORD."
Leviticus,23,26,"Then God texted Moses like, 'Yo dude, listen up!'"
Leviticus,23,27,"On the 10th day of the 7th month, there's gonna be a day where we make up for our mistakes. It's gonna be a special and sacred gathering for you guys. You gotta reflect on your actions and bring an offering that we burn up for the LORD."
Leviticus,23,28,"And like, you gotta chill on that day, no hustlin' or anything, 'cause it's like a special day to make things right with the Big Guy upstairs, ya know?"
Leviticus,23,29,"If anyone doesn't show sadness on that day, they'll be kicked out of their group."
Leviticus,23,30,"If anyone dares to do any work on that day, they will be totally canceled from the squad."
Leviticus,23,31,"Don't bust a move, fam. This rule is gonna be forever and always, from now 'til forever, wherever you homies chill."
Leviticus,23,32,"It's like a chill day for you, where you can totally take a break and reflect on life. On the ninth day of the month, starting in the evening and going all the way until the next evening, you should embrace this chill day and let your souls feel the good vibes."
Leviticus,23,33,"And God was like, 'Yo Moses, listen up,'"
Leviticus,23,34,"Yo, Israel, listen up! On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, we're gonna have this lit celebration called the feast of tabernacles. It's gonna go down for a whole week to honor the LORD. So get ready to party, ya'll!"
Leviticus,23,35,"On the first day, it's time to gather and chillax: no hustle or grind allowed."
Leviticus,23,36,"For a whole week, you gotta light it up for the LORD with some fire offerings. And on the eighth day, it's gonna be a real epic gathering for you, where you'll keep the fire offerings going strong for the LORD. It's gonna be lit, and make sure you don't do any boring work during that time. It's all about that special day, so no grinding, bro."
Leviticus,23,37,"These are the lit events the Lord wants you to flex on, where you gather up and bring your best game to offer some fire to the Lord. We're talking about lit burnt offerings, dope meat offerings, sacrifices, and drink offerings, all on point and on the right day."
Leviticus,23,38,"In addition to the sacred days of the Lord, and in addition to the stuff you give to Him like your gifts, promises, and voluntary offerings."
Leviticus,23,39,"Yo, on the 15th day of the 7th month, after you've gathered all the dope fruit from the land, it's time to throw a lit feast for the LORD that lasts a whole week! The first day is like a chill Sabbath, and then the eighth day is also a Sabbath."
Leviticus,23,40,"On the first day, get some lit branches from swaggy trees like palm trees, thick trees, and willows from the brook. Then, for a whole week, party it up and show your happiness to the LORD your God. Eyyy!"
Leviticus,23,41,"And you gotta turn it into a lit celebration for the big man upstairs, lasting a whole seven days every year. This is gonna be a forever thing that you and your crew gotta keep doing, partying it up in the seventh month."
Leviticus,23,42,"You gotta live in these rad temporary shelters for a whole week, fam. It's like a chill retreat, where every Israelite homie gets in on the vibe and sets up their own cozy booth."
Leviticus,23,43,"So that future peeps know I had the Israel fam crash in tents when I rescued them from Egypt. Just FYI, I'm the real deal, the LORD your God."
Leviticus,23,44,So Moses told the Israelites about all the lit celebrations approved by the LORD.
Leviticus,24,1,"So, the Almighty was like, 'Yo Moses, listen up,'"
Leviticus,24,2,"Yo, tell the Israelites to bring you some legit extra virgin olive oil, like real quality stuff, for the lighting of the lamps. We want those flames to be burning non-stop, like always lit. #litlamps"
Leviticus,24,3,"Aaron gotta keep that testimony flowing in the tabernacle, no hiding anything. He gotta do it from evening 'til morning, non-stop, always in the presence of the LORD. This rule gonna last for generations, no changing it, ever."
Leviticus,24,4,He will make sure the lights are always on fleek on that lit candle holder in front of the LORD.
Leviticus,24,5,And you're gonna grab some fancy flour and bake twelve cakes with it. Each cake will have two tenths of a deal in it.
Leviticus,24,6,"And you're gonna arrange them in two rows, with six in each row, on the clean table in front of the LORD."
Leviticus,24,7,"And you gotta sprinkle some dope frankincense on each row, so it's all lit on the bread as a commemoration, like a sick offering to the LORD."
Leviticus,24,8,"Every weekend he's gotta make sure it's all good in front of the LORD, no breaks, like forever, 'cause it's a promise to the children of Israel."
Leviticus,24,9,"So, like, this food is totally for Aaron and his sons. They gotta eat it in the super holy place 'cause it's like the most holy thing ever. It's one of those offerings that the LORD made with fire, and it's like a forever rule."
Leviticus,24,10,"So there was this dude, right, whose mom was from Israel, but his dad was Egyptian. He hangs out with the Israelites and starts beefing with another Israelite guy in the camp."
Leviticus,24,11,"So, this Israelite dude straight up started dissing the name of the LORD and hurling curses left and right. People were like, 'Nah, we can't let this slide,' and took him to Moses for some serious talk. Oh, by the way, this dude's mom's name is Shelomith and she's from the tribe of Dan, in case you were wondering."
Leviticus,24,12,"So they kept him in custody, to understand what the LORD wanted to reveal. {to expound unto them according to the mouth of the LORD: Hebrew: to explain to them according to what the LORD had spoken}"
Leviticus,24,13,"So, God starts talking to Moses, like, for real,"
Leviticus,24,14,"Drag that person who cursed outside the hangout spot, and have everyone who witnessed it put their hands on their head, and then have the whole squad throw rocks at them."
Leviticus,24,15,"Yo, listen up, Israel fam. Check it, if anyone disses our God, they gotta own up to their own mess."
Leviticus,24,16,"If someone disrespects the name of the LORD, they're gonna face serious consequences. The whole crew's gonna come together and stone 'em, whether they're a local or an outsider. Non-negotiable, disrespecting the LORD's name leads to death."
Leviticus,24,17,"If someone takes another person's life, they will definitely face the consequences and be given the death penalty. {smiteth...: Hebrew: strike the life of a person}"
Leviticus,24,18,"If someone kills an animal, they must make restitution, giving up another animal in return. It's a life for a life."
Leviticus,24,19,"So if someone messes up their friend's vibe, they gotta experience the same mess in return."
Leviticus,24,20,"If someone wrongs you, get back at them in a fair and equivalent way. Just like they messed with someone, they should be messed with in return."
Leviticus,24,21,"If someone takes the life of an animal, they must make restitution for it; but if someone takes the life of a human, they will face the penalty of death."
Leviticus,24,22,"You all gotta follow the same set of rules, whether you're from outta town or born and raised here. 'Cause I'm the LORD your God, and that's how we roll."
Leviticus,24,23,"So Moses was like, yo guys, we gotta drag out this dude who was straight-up cursing and stone him with some serious rocks outside the camp. And the Israelite peeps were like, word, we'll do just what the LORD told Moses."
Leviticus,25,1,"So, like, God totally talked to Moses on mount Sinai and said,"
Leviticus,25,2,"Yo, listen up, fam! God's got a message for the Israelites. When you finally reach the land He's givin' you, that place gotta take a break, chillax, and give the Lord a day of rest. #Respect"
Leviticus,25,3,You gotta work the land and take care of your plants for six good years to get a bountiful harvest.
Leviticus,25,4,"But yo, on the seventh year it's gonna be a chill day for the land, a chill day dedicated to the LORD. You gotta lay off your crops and vines, no planting or trimming allowed."
Leviticus,25,5,"You can't harvest any crops that grow on their own from your field, and don't pick any unripe grapes from your vineyard either. It's a year of rest for the land, so let everything grow naturally."
Leviticus,25,6,"The chill day of rest, y'all can grub on the produce of the land. It's all good for you, your crew, even those who work for you, and any visitors kickin' it with you."
Leviticus,25,7,"And for your animals, and for the creatures that are in your land, all the growth will be their food."
Leviticus,25,8,"So like, you gotta count seven sets of seven years, which equals forty-nine years. It's kinda like a cycle, ya know?"
Leviticus,25,9,"Yo, on the tenth of the seventh month, when it's time for atonement, blast the epic jubilant trumpet sound all over your land. It's gonna be LIT! 🎺💥"
Leviticus,25,10,"Yo, listen up! The fiftieth year is gonna be lit! You gotta make it special, like, holy and stuff. Spread the word across the land that everyone's free and can do their own thing. It's gonna be a total celebration, you know? Everyone goes back to their own land and reunites with their fam. How dope is that?"
Leviticus,25,11,"That fiftieth year shall be a total vibe for you: you gotta take a break from planting, harvesting whatever grows on its own, and picking those fresh grapes from your vine without getting it all neat and tidy."
Leviticus,25,12,"Yo, it's time for the jubile, fam! It's gonna be lit and all holy vibes, ya know? You can totally feast on the bountiful harvest straight from the fields. No cap!"
Leviticus,25,13,"When the year of celebration comes around, everyone gotta go back and get what's rightfully theirs."
Leviticus,25,14,"And if you sell something to your friend, or buy something from your friend, you must not be unfair to each other:"
Leviticus,25,15,"Yo, check it out, when it comes to buying stuff from your neighbor after the jubile, you gotta consider the years they've been holding onto it. And when they sell you their goods, the number of years they've been growing those fruits matters, yo!"
Leviticus,25,16,"As time goes on, the value will go up if it's been around for a while, but if it's still new, the price will be lower. The price is based on how many good years it has left, so that's what you're paying for."
Leviticus,25,17,"So, like, don't be all mean and stuff to each other, okay? But like, respect your God and be all afraid and stuff because I'm the LORD, your God, you know?"
Leviticus,25,18,"So, like, make sure you follow my rules, keep them in mind, actually do them, and then you'll have peaceful vibes while living in this land."
Leviticus,25,19,"And the earth will totally come through with its bounty, and you'll feast on your favorite foods, and chillax in safety within its realms."
Leviticus,25,20,"And like, if y'all are like, 'Yo, what are we gonna munch on in the seventh year? Like, we can't even plant or harvest our crops anymore, bruh:'"
Leviticus,25,21,"Yo, I'm about to drop a major blessing on you in year six, and it's gonna keep the good vibes flowing for three whole years, producing mad fruit!"
Leviticus,25,22,"And in the eighth year, you shall plant crops and still enjoy the leftover harvest until the ninth year. Until the new fruits come in, you can feast on the previous year's stock."
Leviticus,25,23,"Yo, the land is off limits for sale forever, cuz it belongs to me. Just a reminder, y'all are like visitors and travelers hangin' out with me."
Leviticus,25,24,"And you gotta give back the land in all the areas you own, okay?"
Leviticus,25,25,"Yo, if your bro is, like, super broke and had to sell some of his stuff, and if any of his fam wants to buy it back, then they should totally do it, man. Gotta help your brother out and make sure he gets back what he had to sell."
Leviticus,25,26,"And if the dude doesn't have anyone to hook him up, but he's got the means to do it himself, he's gotta step up and handle it all on his own."
Leviticus,25,27,"Yo, like, if someone sold something and later realizes they made an extra profit, they gotta figure out how many years passed and give that extra cash back to the person they sold it to. So, they can get their thing back and return to owning it."
Leviticus,25,28,"But if he can't give it back, then what he sold will stay with the person who bought it until the year of jubilee. When the jubilee comes, it will be released, and he will get his property back."
Leviticus,25,29,"If someone sells a house in a city with walls, they have the right to buy it back within a year after selling it. They've got a whole year to make the redemption happen."
Leviticus,25,30,"And if it's not bought back within a whole year, then the house in the city with walls shall belong forever to the person who purchased it for all their descendants. It won't be released during the jubilee."
Leviticus,25,31,"So, like, the villages without walls, they're gonna be treated like fields in the countryside. You can totally buy them back and the peeps living there get to leave in this rad celebration called jubile. It's like, their redemption, ya know?"
Leviticus,25,32,"Like, the Levites can totally buy back their cities whenever, you know, and their houses in those cities too."
Leviticus,25,33,"If someone buys a house from the Levites, that house and the city it's in will be returned in the year of jubilee. The cities of the Levites are their property among the Israelites."
Leviticus,25,34,"But like, they can't sell the land around their cities, man! It's, like, their forever property and stuff."
Leviticus,25,35,"And yo, if your bro is broke and struggling alongside you, then you gotta help him out, even if he's a total stranger or just passing through. The goal is to give him a chance to thrive with you. Handd failin' and all that) And when I say help, I mean like lift him up, empower him, ya know?"
Leviticus,25,36,"Don't charge interest or make extra profit from someone, but respect your God so that your fellow brother can thrive alongside you."
Leviticus,25,37,"Don't be charging interest when you loan money to your homie, and don't be expecting a profit when you lend them food."
Leviticus,25,38,"I'm like your ultimate big boss, the one who saved you from Egypt and hooked you up with the land of Canaan, all so I can be your forever God."
Leviticus,25,39,"And if your bro who lives near you ends up being broke and sells himself to you, you can't force him to be your servant forever. You gotta treat him like a homie, not a servant."
Leviticus,25,40,"But like a part-time worker or someone crashing at your place, he'll be with you and help you out until the jubilee year comes around."
Leviticus,25,41,"And then he'll bounce from your life, him and his squad, and go back to his fam, inheritin' the legacy of his ancestors."
Leviticus,25,42,"They're like my squad, the ones I rescued from Egypt. No way I'm letting them be sold off as slaves. No way I'm about that slave trade vibe."
Leviticus,25,43,Don't be a total control freak over someone; just respect and fear your God.
Leviticus,25,44,"You will have slaves from the neighboring nations; they will be your male and female servants, and you can acquire them by purchasing."
Leviticus,25,45,"Also, if there are any cool kids from other countries hanging out with you, you can totally buy them and their families who have been born in your land. They'll be your squad for real."
Leviticus,25,46,"And you'll pass them down to your kids as an inheritance, so they can possess them. They'll be your servants forever. But don't treat your fellow Israelites harshly by ruling over them with force."
Leviticus,25,47,"If a foreigner or someone new to the city becomes successful because of you, and your friend who lives nearby becomes poor and has to sell themselves to the foreigner or new person in the area, or to the relatives of that foreigner:"
Leviticus,25,48,"Once he's been sold, there's a chance for him to be bought back; one of his own family members can be the one to buy him back:"
Leviticus,25,49,"His uncle or his cousin can help him out, or any close relative from his family can step in to help him out; or if he's able, he can even help himself out."
Leviticus,25,50,"And the person who purchased him shall calculate the time from when he was sold until the year of jubilee, and the price of his purchase shall be based on the number of years, similar to what a hired worker would earn during that time."
Leviticus,25,51,"If there's still a bunch of years left, he's gotta cough up the cash to buy back his freedom, equal to the original price he was sold for."
Leviticus,25,52,"And if there's only a few years left until the year of jubile, then the person should tally it up and pay back the value of their release based on their remaining years."
Leviticus,25,53,"And he'll work for him like a part-time gig worker, but the boss can't be all controlling and strict in front of you."
Leviticus,25,54,"And if he hasn't been freed during these years, then he'll be released during the year of jubile, along with his squad of children. By the way, this is how it's gonna go down."
Leviticus,25,55,"So, like, the deal is, the children of Israel are totally my squad. They're my true ride-or-dies that I rescued from Egypt, you know? And hey, just so you know, I'm the big boss in charge here - I'm the LORD, your God."
Leviticus,26,1,"Don't make any idols or statues, don't even think about setting up some fancy stone image in your territory, and definitely don't worship it. I'm the LORD your God, so just chill and show some respect."
Leviticus,26,2,"Yo, you gotta keep my sabbaths and show respect to my sanctuary. I'm the LORD, no cap."
Leviticus,26,3,"If you follow my rules, and obey my commands, and actually do them;"
Leviticus,26,4,"And I'll make it rain when it's supposed to, and the land's gonna produce a ton of crops, and the trees in the fields are gonna bear mad fruit, dude!"
Leviticus,26,5,"And like, your gains will be super awesome, going from one dope harvest to the next, and the time to plant will totally blend into the time to gather. And you'll totally feast on your bread until you're fully stuffed, living in your land with mad security."
Leviticus,26,6,"I got you covered, fam! There's gonna be mad peace in the land, and you can chillax without anyone making you shake in your sneakers. Plus, I'm gonna kick those savage beasts outta here, so you won't have to worry about any swords ruining the vibe in your hood. Trust me, it's gonna be lit!"
Leviticus,26,7,"And you'll totally own your haters, like, you'll chase them down and they'll straight up be defeated by your sword skills."
Leviticus,26,8,"Like, seriously, five of you will totally go after a hundred and, like, a hundred of you will totally own ten thousand in battle. Your enemies will just, like, totally get wrecked by your swords, no doubt."
Leviticus,26,9,"Because I'll totally have your back, and help you thrive, and let your squad grow, and solidify my covenant with you."
Leviticus,26,10,"And y'all can totally feast on the nostalgic goodies, and flex your retro style together with the fresh and trendy ones."
Leviticus,26,11,"And I'll totally set up my hangout spot right in your midst: and trust me, I won't even be remotely disgusted by you."
Leviticus,26,12,"And I'll be chillin' with y'all, bein' your God, and you'll be my squad."
Leviticus,26,13,"I'm the LORD your God, the one who set you free from Egypt so you wouldn't be slaves anymore. I've smashed your chains and made you walk tall."
Leviticus,26,14,"But, like, if you don't listen to me and refuse to follow all these rules;"
Leviticus,26,15,"And like, if you totally diss my rules or if your soul is like totally grossed out by my judgments, and you're like, 'Nah, I'm not gonna follow all of your commandments,' and you end up breaking my covenant..."
Leviticus,26,16,"I'mma bring some serious chaos your way, like straight up terror, sickness, and fever that's gonna mess with your vision and make your hearts heavy with sadness. And on top of that, when you try to plant your crops, it's gonna be a total waste 'cause your enemies gonna swoop in and eat 'em all."
Leviticus,26,17,"And I'll be totally against you, so you're like, totally doomed to be defeated by your enemies. The people who legit can't stand you will totally be in charge, and you'll freak out and run away when there's actually no one chasing you."
Leviticus,26,18,"And if you still refuse to listen to me, then I'm gonna have to dish out seven times the consequences for your mistakes."
Leviticus,26,19,"And I'll totally bring down your ego and make your dreams feel unattainable, while your world feels like a solid block of metal and your surroundings become as hard as shiny brass:"
Leviticus,26,20,"And all the effort you put in will be for nothing: because your land won't produce any crops, and the trees won't bear any fruits."
Leviticus,26,21,"But if you like, totally go against me and ignore what I'm saying, then brace yourself for some major consequences. I'm talking about seven times the amount of troubles coming your way, straight up karma for all the wrong things you've done."
Leviticus,26,22,"I'm gonna let loose some savage creatures on you, who will snatch away your lil' ones, wreck your livestock, and seriously thin out your crew. Your usual paths are gonna be deserted."
Leviticus,26,23,"And if you don't wanna get your act together despite everything I've been tryna teach you, but instead insist on going against me;"
Leviticus,26,24,"If you keep messing up, I'll definitely come at you with consequences, like, seven times worse for all your wrongdoings."
Leviticus,26,25,"And I'll bring in some serious heat that'll totally take revenge on all the drama going against our agreement. Once you all gather up in your cities, I'll send some major sickness vibes your way, and you'll end up being handed over to your enemies."
Leviticus,26,26,"And when your bread stash runs out, there will be a squad of ten ladies baking your bread in a super-oven. They'll even measure it out for you! But guess what? You'll chow down on it, and you still won't be full. Like, seriously, can't even get satisfied."
Leviticus,26,27,"If you straight up don't listen to me after all this, but instead choose to go against what I'm saying;"
Leviticus,26,28,"I'll totally be ticked off and give you a taste of my discipline if you keep going against me. Like, for real, I'll make sure you pay for your wrongs seven times over."
Leviticus,26,29,And you'll chow down on your sons' and daughters' flesh.
Leviticus,26,30,"And I'm gonna wreck your fancy hangouts, demolish your statues, and throw your lifeless bodies on top of your worthless idols. Gotta say, my soul's gonna totally despise you."
Leviticus,26,31,"And I'm gonna totally trash your cities, leave your holy places in ruins, and I won't even appreciate the sweet smells you're offering."
Leviticus,26,32,"And I'm gonna make the land all empty and abandoned, and the peeps who have beef with you are gonna be super shook when they see it."
Leviticus,26,33,"I'm gonna like totally disperse you among all these people who aren't down with our beliefs, and I'll send this sword-wielding trouble your way. Your homeland will be a ghost town and your cities will be ruins."
Leviticus,26,34,"Once the land is left deserted and you guys are stuck in your enemies' territory, that's when the land can finally have some downtime and chill out, enjoying its sabbaths."
Leviticus,26,35,"While it's all abandoned, it'll chill out and recharge because it never took a break during your chill days when you were living there."
Leviticus,26,36,"For those of you who survive, I'm gonna make your enemies so freakin' scared that they get weak in the knees. Just the sound of a leaf rustling will make 'em run like they're being chased by a sword. And even when no one's after 'em, they'll stumble and fall."
Leviticus,26,37,"And they'll start tripping over each other, like, out of nowhere, man... And you won't stand a chance against your enemies, no matter how hard you try."
Leviticus,26,38,"And like, you're totally gonna get wiped out by the non-believers, and your enemies are gonna totally devour your land."
Leviticus,26,39,"And those of you who survive will suffer the consequences of your wrongdoing in the territories of your enemies; just like your ancestors, you will also bear the burden of their past wrongdoings."
Leviticus,26,40,"If they own up to their wrongs, including the wrongs of their ancestors, and admit the ways they've messed up and rebelled against me;"
Leviticus,26,41,"So like, I totally went against them and made them end up in their enemies' land. But, if they are willing to humble themselves and actually admit they messed up, then I'll be cool with punishing them for their wrongdoings."
Leviticus,26,42,"I'll totally remember the promises I made to Jacob, Isaac, and Abraham, and I'll also remember the land I promised them, no doubt!"
Leviticus,26,43,"Yo, the land's gonna be abandoned by them and get a break by observing her sabbaths while she's empty without them. They gotta face the consequences of their wrongdoing cuz they straight up disrespected my laws and hated my commandments."
Leviticus,26,44,"And even though they might find themselves in enemy territory, I won't abandon them or despise them so much that I wipe them out and break my promise with them. 'Cause I'm still the LORD their God."
Leviticus,26,45,"But yo, I got mad love for their ancestors, who I brought out of Egypt in front of all those other nations, just so I could be their God. I'm the LORD, no doubt."
Leviticus,26,46,"Here's the deal: These are the rules and regulations that the LORD established, right on Mount Sinai through Moses, for the children of Israel."
Leviticus,27,1,"God was like, yo Moses, listen up!"
Leviticus,27,2,"Yo, listen up, peeps of Israel! If a dude decides to make a super specific promise, those people involved gotta be dedicated to the LORD, and you gotta figure out their worth."
Leviticus,27,3,"And you gotta set a value for guys between 20 and 60 years old, and that value is gonna be 50 shekels of silver, just like the ones they use at the holy place."
Leviticus,27,4,"And if it's a female, then you should value it at thirty shekels."
Leviticus,27,5,"If it's someone between the ages of five and twenty, you gotta pay twenty shekels for a guy and ten shekels for a girl, no cap."
Leviticus,27,6,"If the person is between one month and five years old, you should estimate their worth at five silver shekels if they're male, and three silver shekels if they're female."
Leviticus,27,7,"And if someone is 60 years old or older, and they're a dude, you gotta pay 'em 15 shekels. But if they're a lady, it's just 10 shekels, yo."
Leviticus,27,8,"But like, if he's, you know, not as rich as you thought, then he has to go meet the priest and the priest will evaluate him. The priest will assign a value to him based on how much he can actually afford to give."
Leviticus,27,9,"And if it's an animal that people offer to the LORD, anything that anyone gives from that animal to the LORD will be sacred."
Leviticus,27,10,"He can't switch or swap it, trading something good for something bad, or something bad for something good. And if he does decide to exchange one animal for another, then both the animal and the swap are considered sacred."
Leviticus,27,11,"And if it's some kind of unclean animal that they don't offer as a sacrifice to the LORD, then they gotta bring the animal to the priest:"
Leviticus,27,12,"The priest has to give it a fair assessment, whether it's excellent or not so great. Whatever value the priest assigns to it, that's how it's gonna be. So basically, the priest's opinion is what really matters here."
Leviticus,27,13,"But if he actually wants to buy it back, then he has to pay an extra 20% of its value."
Leviticus,27,14,"Yo, when a person decides to make their crib all holy for the Lord, the priest gotta come over and check it out. They'll evaluate if it's lit or not, and whatever the priest determines, that's how it's gonna roll."
Leviticus,27,15,"And if the one who made it sacred wants to buy back his house, he has to pay an additional fifth of the money you valued it at, and then it becomes his again."
Leviticus,27,16,"If someone sets apart a portion of their land as an offering to the LORD, the value of it should be based on the amount of seed it can produce. For example, if it can yield enough barley seed to measure a homer, it would be valued at fifty shekels of silver. (By the way, a homer is a unit of measurement for land.)"
Leviticus,27,17,"If someone sets apart their field until the year of celebration, according to your assessment, it should remain untouched."
Leviticus,27,18,"But if he sets apart his field after the jubile, then the priest will calculate the cash based on the remaining years until the next jubile, and it will be deducted from the total value."
Leviticus,27,19,"And if the person who set aside the field wants to buy it back, they must pay an additional 20% of the appraised value, making it officially theirs."
Leviticus,27,20,"And if he doesn't want to buy back the land, or if he has already sold the land to someone else, it can't be bought back again."
Leviticus,27,21,"But yo, when that field bounces in the jubile, it be straight up sacred for the LORD, like a totally devoted field; the priest be owning that shiz."
Leviticus,27,22,"And if someone dedicates a field they have purchased to the LORD, but it's not part of their own land,"
Leviticus,27,23,"The priest will calculate how much you're worth until the year of jubilee. On that day, he'll give your value as a sacred offering to the LORD."
Leviticus,27,24,"During the year of jubile, the field will go back to the original owner, the one who originally owned the land."
Leviticus,27,25,"And like, all your calculations gotta be based on the sacred shekel, you know? Like, twenty gerahs will make up one shekel."
Leviticus,27,26,"You can't dedicate any firstborn animals as an offering to the Lord. Whether it's an ox or a sheep, it belongs to the Lord as his firstborn."
Leviticus,27,27,"And if it's like, a nasty animal or whatever, then you gotta like, buy it back based on how much it's worth, and throw in an extra fifth as a bonus: or if you don't buy it back, then you can sell it for how much it's worth."
Leviticus,27,28,"Yo, listen up! Any item, whether it's a human or an animal or something from your property, that's dedicated to the LORD can't be sold or bought back. It's considered super sacred and belongs solely to the LORD."
Leviticus,27,29,Any person who is declared devoted cannot be bought back; they must be put to death.
Leviticus,27,30,"Like, all the tithe stuff from the land, whether it's from the seeds or the fruits of the trees, belongs to the LORD. It's legit super sacred to Him."
Leviticus,27,31,"And if someone wants to redeem any of their tithes, they should add an extra 20% to it."
Leviticus,27,32,"When it comes to givin' a tenth of your animal herd or flock - any critter that goes under the rod - that tenth is gonna be set apart for the LORD, all sacred and stuff."
Leviticus,27,33,"He won't overthink whether it's a vibe or not, and he won't try to tweak it. But if he does decide to make a change, both the original and the new version will be super legit; it can't be reversed or cancelled."
Leviticus,27,34,"Yo, peep this, these are the rules that the LORD dropped on Moses for the Israel squad straight up at mount Sinai."
Numbers,1,1,"So, the big man upstairs talked to Moses while they were chillin' in the middle of nowhere (specifically the Sinai wilderness), inside the meeting place tent, on the first day of the second month, during the second year after they dipped from Egypt. And here's what He had to say..."
Numbers,1,2,"Yo, gather up the whole crew of Israelites, y'know, count 'em all by their fams and their dads' houses, and tally up their names, like each dude countin' off."
Numbers,1,3,"All the dudes in Israel who are 20 or older and capable of joining the battle—y'all gotta be counted up by you and Aaron, army style."
Numbers,1,4,"And, like, you gotta have a representative dude from each tribe, you know? Each one being the top dog of their own family, man."
Numbers,1,5,"So, these are the dudes who got your back: Reuben's crew, you got Elizur, Shedeur's kid."
Numbers,1,6,"Simeon's crew: Shelumiel, the offspring of Zurishaddai, holding it down."
Numbers,1,7,"In the tribe of Judah, there was Nahshon, Amminadab's offspring."
Numbers,1,8,"Issachar squad representin' with Nethaneel, Zuar's son."
Numbers,1,9,"Representing Zebulun, we have Eliab, Helon's son."
Numbers,1,10,"From the Joseph fam: for Ephraim, it's Elishama, Ammihud's kid. And for Manasseh, it's Gamaliel, Pedahzur's offspring."
Numbers,1,11,"Representing Benjamin, we've got Abidan, cool kid and offspring of Gideoni."
Numbers,1,12,"Dan's crew includes Ahiezer, the son of Ammishaddai."
Numbers,1,13,"Yo, Asher had this dude named Pagiel, son of Ocran."
Numbers,1,14,"This dude Gad had a son named Eliasaph, whose other name was Deuel (or Reuel, if you wanna be fancy)."
Numbers,1,15,"For Naphtali, there was Ahira, Enan's kid."
Numbers,1,16,"These were the total legends of the crew, straight-up bosses of their family tribes, leaders of massive squads in Israel."
Numbers,1,17,"So Moses and Aaron took these dudes, and I'm about to drop their names for you:"
Numbers,1,18,"So, like, everyone came together on the first day of the second month, right? And they started sharing all their family history and stuff, you know, their whole ancestry. They did it all based on their dads' side of the family, you know, counting everyone who was at least twenty years old. It was like a whole big headcount thing, you know?"
Numbers,1,19,"Just like how God told Moses, he counted them in the middle of nowhere at Sinai."
Numbers,1,20,"And the kids of Reuben, Israel's OG son, organized by their fams, all based on their dads' crib, counting them up by name and ID, only including the dudes who were twenty or older, ready to go out and fight in battle;"
Numbers,1,21,"So, like, the peeps from the tribe of Reuben, there were like, um, 46,500 of them, ya know?"
Numbers,1,22,"So, like, for the Simeonites, they were counted and stuff, based on their families and stuff, you know? Like, the dudes who were counted were like, all the guys who were like 20 years old and older and ready to go to war and stuff. Oh, and they were counted like, individually, by their names and everything."
Numbers,1,23,"So, like, the peeps from the tribe of Simeon, their total came to fifty-nine thousand and three hundred. Can you believe it?"
Numbers,1,24,"In the fam of Gad, based on their fam history, their dads' crew decide how many peeps of fighting age there were, starting from twenty and up, ready to join the battle squad."
Numbers,1,25,"Yo, the tribe of Gad had a total of 45,650 people in their count."
Numbers,1,26,"So, like, the peeps from the tribe of Judah, sorted by their fams and stuff, based on their dad's crib and the count of their names, dude, starting from 20 years old and older, all the ones ready to hit the battlefield, you know?"
Numbers,1,27,The peeps from the tribe of Judah had a total of 74.6K heads counted.
Numbers,1,28,"This is the deal with the Issachar fam: counting all the fam members by their generations, families, and their dads' houses. We only counting peeps who are at least 20 years old and can handle themselves in a war. So basically, only the warriors are getting counted."
Numbers,1,29,"There were, like, 54,400 peeps from the tribe of Issachar."
Numbers,1,30,"So, this is the deal: The dudes from the tribe of Zebulun - we're talking about their fam and all - were counted, ya know? They were like 20 years old and older, ready to go into battle. They numbered 'em all and everything, based on their names and their dads' houses."
Numbers,1,31,"The peeps from the Zebulun tribe were a solid 57,400 deep when they got counted."
Numbers,1,32,"From the crew of Joseph, specifically the offspring of Ephraim, sorted by their bloodlines, organized by their family units and patriarchal homes, counting all the individuals who were twenty years or older, and capable of joining the battle ranks;"
Numbers,1,33,"There were like 40K and 500 of the squad from the Ephraim tribe, you know?"
Numbers,1,34,"So, like, of the peeps from the fam of Manasseh, counting all the descendants and their fams, based on the dads' lineages, and like, the total number of peeps who were like, 20 years old and older, and were ready to, you know, fight in battle;"
Numbers,1,35,"So, like, there were a total of 32,200 peeps from the tribe of Manasseh who got counted."
Numbers,1,36,"Among the peeps of Benjamin, based on their fams and all, by their fams' cribs, counting all those with dope names, from when they turned twenty and older, every one who was ready to throw down in battle;"
Numbers,1,37,"So, like, the people from the tribe of Benjamin, their count was, you know, 35,400."
Numbers,1,38,"So, like, the peeps from the tribe of Dan, you know, organized and all, based on their fams and stuff, according to how many of them there were who were like a certain age and older, and who was fit for battle and ready to go out there and fight."
Numbers,1,39,"So, like, the people from the tribe of Dan, there were a total of 62,700 of them, you know?"
Numbers,1,40,"So, like, the dudes from the Asher tribe, they were organized into clans, according to their family line and their dad's house. They counted all the bros who were like at least twenty years old and could join the army and fight and stuff."
Numbers,1,41,"So, like, there were, um, you know, 41,500 peeps from the tribe of Asher in the count."
Numbers,1,42,"Yo, check it out. This is about the peeps from the tribe of Naphtali. So, like, throughout all their descendants and families, they were organized based on their dads' houses and all that. And get this, they counted how many people there were who were at least twenty years old and strong enough to join the army. Pretty cool, right?"
Numbers,1,43,"So, like, the people from the tribe of Naphtali, they were, like, 53,400 in total."
Numbers,1,44,"These are the people that Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of Israel counted - twelve in total, each representing their family."
Numbers,1,45,"All the peeps of Israel, 20 or older, ready to flex and fight for Israel, were counted by their fams,"
Numbers,1,46,"There were like 603.5K peeps in da count, no cap."
Numbers,1,47,"But the Levites, following their ancestral tribe, weren't counted among the rest."
Numbers,1,48,"So, God was like, talking to Moses and was all like,"
Numbers,1,49,Just don't count the Levi tribe or try to keep track of their numbers among the Israelite kids:
Numbers,1,50,"But, like, you gotta choose the Levites to be in charge of the super important tabernacle and everything in it. They gotta carry the tabernacle and all its stuff and take care of it. They gotta serve and be totally present for it, and they gotta camp all around the tabernacle, you know?"
Numbers,1,51,"When the tabernacle moves, the Levites got it covered. They take it down when it's time to move, and set it up when it's time to settle. Anybody who tries to mess with it better watch out, because they'll be dealt with."
Numbers,1,52,"So, like, the Israelites gotta set up their tents, right? Each person chillin' in their own spot, stickin' to their own crew, with their own flag and all. They gotta do this in their cool squads and set up camp wherever they roll."
Numbers,1,53,"Yo, so here's the deal: the Levites gotta set up shop all around the tabernacle of testimony, making sure the whole Israelite crew stays on God's good side and avoids any divine anger. They're responsible for holding it down and taking care of everything in the tabernacle of testimony. Righteous, right?"
Numbers,1,54,"And the Israel fam totally followed everything the LORD told Moses. They were like, 'we got you, homie.'"
Numbers,2,1,"So like, God was all, 'Yo Moses and Aaron, listen up,'"
Numbers,2,2,"Yo, all the dudes from the children of Israel gonna set up their own standard, repping their dad's house. They gonna chill way off near the tabernacle of the congregation, you know, like right across from it."
Numbers,2,3,"And on the east side where the sun comes up, the crew representing the camp of Judah will set up camp with all their squads. Nahshon, Amminadab's son, will lead the way for the people of Judah."
Numbers,2,4,"And the crew, along with the ones who were counted, were like, sixty-four thousand and six hundred strong."
Numbers,2,5,"And the ones camping next to him will be the tribe of Issachar. Nethaneel, Zuar's son, will be the leader of the Issacharites."
Numbers,2,6,"And the gang, and the squad that was repping, consisted of a solid 54.4k."
Numbers,2,7,"And representing the Zebulun squad is Eliab, Helon's offspring, who's about to take charge of the Zebulun crew."
Numbers,2,8,"And his squad, and the total count, were like 57k4h (57,400)."
Numbers,2,9,"In the Judah squad, there were like a hundred thousand, eighty thousand, six thousand, and four hundred people. They're the ones leading the pack, yo."
Numbers,2,10,"On the south side, the camp of Reuben will have their flag, with Elizur, son of Shedeur, leading their troops."
Numbers,2,11,"So, his crew and all the people in it, there were a total of 46,500."
Numbers,2,12,"And the ones who camp next to him will be from the tribe of Simeon, and the leader of the Simeonites will be Shelumiel, son of Zurishaddai."
Numbers,2,13,"And the squad, and all the peeps in it, were like fifty-nine thousand and three hundred in total."
Numbers,2,14,"Next up, the squad of Gad: Eliasaph, Reuel's son, will be leading the way for the sons of Gad. (By the way, Reuel is also known as Deuel.)"
Numbers,2,15,"And the squad he had, those counted among them, were 45,650 strong."
Numbers,2,16,"The total number of peeps in Reuben's crew was 150,450, spread out across their squads. And they're gonna roll out in the second wave, ya know?"
Numbers,2,17,"Then the meeting spot will move along with the Levites in the middle of the crew. They'll camp and move forward according to their assigned spots, each person following their own team."
Numbers,2,18,"The squad of Ephraim will rock it on the west side, with their leader Elishama, Ammihud's offspring, leading their crew like a boss."
Numbers,2,19,"And his squad, and the ones that got counted, they were, like, 40k and 500."
Numbers,2,20,"And Manasseh's crew will be led by Gamaliel, Pedahzur's offspring."
Numbers,2,21,"And his crew, and the total number of them, were 32.2K."
Numbers,2,22,"Next up is the crew from Benjamin, led by Abidan, son of Gideoni. He's got it on lock for his tribe, no doubt."
Numbers,2,23,"And his squad, and the total number of them, were like, 35.4k."
Numbers,2,24,"There were like, a whopping 108.1K soldiers in the Ephraim squad, ready to rumble. And they were gonna bring it, stepping up strong in the third position."
Numbers,2,25,"Yo, the camp of Dan gonna be on the north, surrounded by their armies, and leading the children of Dan is gonna be Ahiezer, Ammishaddai's son, as their captain."
Numbers,2,26,"And his crew, and the total number of them, were sixty-two thousand and seven hundred."
Numbers,2,27,"And the squad chilling with him will be the crew of Asher: and the leader of the Asher squad will be Pagiel, Ocran's son."
Numbers,2,28,"And the squad, along with all the cool peeps in it, totaled up to a whopping forty-one thousand five hundred!"
Numbers,2,29,"And now, peep this squad from Naphtali: leading the pack of Naphtali crew will be Ahira, the offspring of Enan."
Numbers,2,30,"And the squad, along with all those who got counted, totaled up to fifty-three thousand and four hundred."
Numbers,2,31,"So, like, there were, like, a hundred thousand and fifty-seven thousand and six hundred peeps in the camp of Dan. And they gotta, like, chill in the back with their flags or whatever."
Numbers,2,32,"So here's the deal: we got a headcount of all the Israelite peeps, organized by their family clans. The total number of folks included in this count, spread across all the different squads, was a whopping six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty."
Numbers,2,33,"But, like, the Levites weren't part of the headcount with the other Israelites, cuz that's what the LORD told Moses to do."
Numbers,2,34,"So, like, the Israelites totally followed all the instructions that the LORD gave to Moses. They set up camp in their designated spots and went on their way, like, moving forward and all. Each fam had their own assigned spot, you know, based on their dad's lineage."
Numbers,3,1,Here's the fam history of Aaron and Moses when the LORD was chatting with Moses up on Mount Sinai.
Numbers,3,2,"So like, Aaron had these four sons and their names were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar."
Numbers,3,3,"So, these are the names of Aaron's boys, the cool priests who were chosen and set apart to do their priestly duties. It's like they got totally blessed by being anointed. And just to be clear, they were chosen and filled with the power to do their priestly thing by Aaron himself."
Numbers,3,4,"So, Nadab and Abihu straight up got smited by the LORD because they pulled a major goof and offered some sketchy fire in the presence of the LORD. This happened in the wild 'n' free Sinai land, and to top it off, they didn't even have any kids. To fill their vacancy, Eleazar and Ithamar stepped up and did the priestly tasks while Aaron, their dad, looked on."
Numbers,3,5,"So God talked to Moses like,"
Numbers,3,6,"Gather the Levi squad and bring them to Aaron the head honcho priest, so they can be his trusted crew for all things ministry."
Numbers,3,7,"And they gotta make sure they stay on top of their duties, looking after the whole crew and keeping everything in check by the hangout spot, making sure everything runs smoothly in the hangout."
Numbers,3,8,"And they gotta be responsible for all the stuff in the gathering place, like the instruments and everything, and make sure the Israelite peeps take care of business and do all the tasks needed for the gathering place."
Numbers,3,9,And you gotta hook up Aaron and his fam with the Levites. They totally belong to them from the Israelite crew.
Numbers,3,10,"Yo, choose Aaron and his homies to do their priest duties and protect their priest's office. And anyone who ain't part of the crew better watch out 'cause they'll be straight up terminated."
Numbers,3,11,"yo, God came at Moses like,"
Numbers,3,12,"Yo, listen up! Check it, I've chosen the Levites from the fam of Israel to take the place of all the firstborn who come out of the womb. So basically, the Levites are gonna be all mine, ya dig?"
Numbers,3,13,"Yo, all the firstborn, they belong to me, you know what I'm saying? When I unleashed my power and messed up Egypt, that's when I specially claimed all the firstborn in Israel, humans and animals alike. They're mine, fam. I'm the almighty, no doubt."
Numbers,3,14,"So, God was like talking to Moses out in the middle of nowhere, in Sinai, and this is what He said,"
Numbers,3,15,"Count all the Levi kids according to their dads' houses, by their fams. You gotta count all the dudes who are one month old or older."
Numbers,3,16,"So Moses counted them just as the LORD told him to. {translation: in other words, exactly as God said}"
Numbers,3,17,"So, like, these were the dudes from the Levi squad, you know? They had some pretty cool names: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
Numbers,3,18,"So here's the deal, these are the names of Gershon's sons and their fams: Libni and Shimei, ya feel me?"
Numbers,3,19,"And Kohath had some sons: Amram, Izehar, Hebron, and Uzziel, each belonging to their own family."
Numbers,3,20,"And Merari had these cool families: Mahli and Mushi. So, these are the families of the Levites based on their dad's houses."
Numbers,3,21,"The Libnites and the Shimites were part of Gershon's crew. Ya heard? These dudes were reppin' the Gershonites, straight up."
Numbers,3,22,"So, like, there were seven thousand, five hundred dudes, you know, all aged one month and older, all, like, counted up and stuff."
Numbers,3,23,"The Gershonite fams gonna set up shop behind the tabernacle, towards the west side."
Numbers,3,24,"And the head of the fam of the Gershonites gotta be Eliasaph, Lael's kid."
Numbers,3,25,"The job of the Gershon dudes in the gathering spot party crib is to take care of the party crib itself, the chill camping pad, the dope roof, and the swaggy entrance curtain."
Numbers,3,26,"And the sick curtains all around the chill hangout spot, and the epic door curtain for the chill hangout spot, which is right by the chill tabernacle and the lit altar, and the sick cords for all the chill services there."
Numbers,3,27,"The Kohath fam got the Amram squad, the Izehar clique, the Hebron crew, and the Uzziel squad. Those peeps are the fams of the Kohath squad."
Numbers,3,28,"There were a total of 8.6K dudes, aged one month and up, holding it down and taking care of the holy place."
Numbers,3,29,"The Kohath fams gonna set up their tents on the south side of the tabernacle, fam."
Numbers,3,30,"And the main guy in charge of the family clans of the Kohathites will be Elizaphan, Uzziel's son, just so you know."
Numbers,3,31,"Their job is to take care of the ark, the table, the candlestick, the altars, the vessels used in the sanctuary, the hanging, and all the other tasks that need to be done."
Numbers,3,32,"And Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, shall be the ultimate leader among the top-notch Levites, and he will be in charge of supervising those who ensure the utmost care for the sacred sanctuary."
Numbers,3,33,"Merari's crew was made up of the Mahlites and the Mushites. That's the fam of Merari, y'all."
Numbers,3,34,"And, like, the total number of dudes that were counted, you know, were like six thousand two hundred, like from just a month old and older."
Numbers,3,35,"The top dude from the fam of Merari was Zuriel, Abihail's son. They gonna set up camp on the north side of the tabernacle."
Numbers,3,36,"The sons of Merari are in charge of taking care of the boards, bars, pillars, sockets, and all the stuff in the tabernacle. They've got the whole setup under their watch, and it's their responsibility to make sure everything's in order."
Numbers,3,37,"And the lit AF pillars of the court all around, with their dope sockets, lit pins, and sick cords."
Numbers,3,38,"But the ones that chill near the tabernacle on the east side, yeah, the ones right by the gathering spot, gotta be Moses, Aaron, and his sons. They're responsible for taking care of the holy place and making sure the Israelites behave. Oh, and if anyone else gets too close, they're getting cancelled... like, literally, they'll be put to death."
Numbers,3,39,"So, like, Moses and Aaron counted all the Levites, you know, as instructed by the LORD. They counted all the guys, from one month old and up, in each family, and the total was, like, twenty-two thousand. Pretty impressive, right?"
Numbers,3,40,"Yo, Moses, listen up. God wants you to count all the baby dudes of Israel, who are one month old and older. Get their names and keep track of 'em."
Numbers,3,41,And you gotta choose the Levites for me (I'm the LORD) instead of all the firstborns of the Israelites; and the Levites' animals instead of all the firstborns of the Israelites' animals.
Numbers,3,42,So Moses did what God told him to do and counted all the firstborn kids in Israel.
Numbers,3,43,"So, like, there were, uh, 22,213 firstborn dude babies who were one month old or older when they were counted."
Numbers,3,44,"So God was like, 'Yo Moses, listen up!'"
Numbers,3,45,"Yo, I got a quick request for y'all. Instead of the firstborn kids of Israel and their animals, I want the Levites and their cattle. They're gonna be on my squad, 'cause I'm the LORD."
Numbers,3,46,"And for those who are gonna be redeemed, there's a total of 213 firstborn children of Israel, which is more than the Levites."
Numbers,3,47,"You gotta collect five shekels from each person, according to the sanctuary shekel (which is twenty gerahs):"
Numbers,3,48,And you gotta send the cash to Aaron and his squad for the redemption of the odd ones.
Numbers,3,49,So Moses collected extra money from those who were redeemed by the Levites:
Numbers,3,50,"He collected money from the firstborn of the Israelites, totaling 1,365 shekels, according to the standard shekel used in the sanctuary:"
Numbers,3,51,"So Moses handed over the cash from those who were saved to Aaron and his crew, just like the LORD said. Moses was just following orders, man."
Numbers,4,1,"So, like, God starts talking to Moses and Aaron, right? And this is what He says,"
Numbers,4,2,"Count all the dudes from the Kohath squad, who are part of the Levi crew, based on their chill families and their dads' cribs."
Numbers,4,3,Anyone between the ages of thirty and fifty who joins the crew and helps out at the gathering spot needs to step up and do their duties at the sacred tent.
Numbers,4,4,"So, this is the gig for the Kohath crew in the tent where everyone gathers - they handle the super sacred stuff, no joke:"
Numbers,4,5,"And when the crew moves on, Aaron and his fam will come through and they'll take down the cool curtain thingy, and use it to cover up the important ark of testimony:"
Numbers,4,6,"Then they'll cover it with badger skin, and put a blue cloth over it completely, and attach the poles to it."
Numbers,4,7,"And they should put a blue cloth on the table, along with the dishes, spoons, and bowls, all covered. The everlasting bread will be placed on it."
Numbers,4,8,"So, they gotta wrap them up in this sick scarlet cloth, and then cover it all with some dope badgers' skins and fix it up with cool staves, ya know."
Numbers,4,9,"And they gotta grab a blue cloth and cover that lit candlestick and all its lamps, tongs, snuff dishes, and oil vessels that are used to take care of it, ya know?"
Numbers,4,10,"And they gotta wrap it up and all the cool stuff inside with some sick badgers' skins. Then they'll slide that bad boy onto a bar, like, totally sleek style."
Numbers,4,11,"And on the sick altar, they gotta lay down a dope blue cloth, and cover it up with some sick badgers' skins, and attach the handles to it:"
Numbers,4,12,"And they gotta grab all the stuff they use for their holy duties in the sacred place, wrap it up in a cool blue cloth, and then cover it with some sweet badgers' skins. Then they gotta put it on a bar."
Numbers,4,13,"And they gotta clean up the ashes from the altar, then put a super stylish purple cloth on it like, WOW!"
Numbers,4,14,"And they gotta place on it all the stuff they use for serving, like the incense burners, the meat hooks, the shovels, and the bowls - basically everything used at the altar. Oh, and don't forget to cover it up with some badger skins and attach the carrying poles to it."
Numbers,4,15,"And once Aaron and his homies finish covering up the sacred space and all the cool stuff in it, and the squad is ready to move out, then it's the Kohath siblings' turn to carry the important stuff, but they better not lay a finger on anything holy, or they'll be straight up dead. These are the major responsibilities of the Kohath siblings in the hangout spot of worship."
Numbers,4,16,"And Eleazar, Aaron's son who rocks the priest game, is in charge of the oil for lighting, the dope incense, the daily food offering, the anointing oil, keeping an eye on the whole tabernacle, and all the cool stuff inside it, like the sanctuary and its lit vessels."
Numbers,4,17,"Yo, God talked to Moses and Aaron, like,"
Numbers,4,18,Don't ditch the Kohathites from the Levites fam squad:
Numbers,4,19,"So here's what you gotta do, fam: make sure you treat them right, so they stay alive and don't get wiped out, when they come near the super sacred stuff. Aaron and his crew will step in and assign each person their specific tasks and responsibilities."
Numbers,4,20,"But, like, they can't go and peek at the holy things all covered up, otherwise they'll, like, die or something."
Numbers,4,21,"And God like totally slid into Moses' DMs, saying,"
Numbers,4,22,"Yo, count up the Gershon homies from each of their fam's houses, man."
Numbers,4,23,"You gotta count all the peeps, aged 30 to 50, who are ready to serve and do work in the spot where everyone comes together. It's like they're getting prepped for battle, ya know?"
Numbers,4,24,This is what the Gershonites are responsible for: serving and carrying burdens.
Numbers,4,25,"And they gotta carry the cool curtains of the tabernacle, and the tabernacle for everyone to hang out, the stuff that goes on top, and like the super chill covering made from badgers' skins that's put over it. Oh, and they also need to hang up the door cover for the tabernacle. Pretty lit, right?"
Numbers,4,26,"And the cool curtains surrounding the court, and the dope curtain for the entrance to the gate of the court, yo, right by the tabernacle and the altar and all that, and their cords, and all the lit equipment they use, and everything specifically made for them, that's how they gonna serve."
Numbers,4,27,"Aaron and his crew are in charge of all the stuff the Gershonites have to do, including all their hard work and tasks. Make sure to give them clear instructions on what they need to be responsible for."
Numbers,4,28,"So, here's what the fam of Gershon's sons gotta do in the tabernacle: they're under the authority of Ithamar, Aaron the priest's son. No joke, that's their gig."
Numbers,4,29,"When it comes to the Merari fam, you gotta count 'em up based on their family and their dad's crib."
Numbers,4,30,"You gotta count all the peeps that are between thirty and fifty years old, cause they're the ones gonna do the work for the tabernacle. It's like a service, but more like a battle, ya know? {service: btw, it's Hebrew for warfare}"
Numbers,4,31,"And this is what they had to do, all of their tasks in the sacred meeting place: setting up the wooden walls, attaching the bars, erecting the sturdy pillars, and securing the foundations."
Numbers,4,32,"So like, there were these dope pillars all around the court, and not gonna lie, they had these cool sockets and pins with cords and all that jazz. And oh yeah, they had all these sick instruments and stuff for their service. And yo, make sure you know the names of all the instruments they used in their tasks, it's important!"
Numbers,4,33,"This is how the fams of the Merari boys do their thing, you know. They handle all the tasks at the meeting place, taking directions from Ithamar, Aaron's son, who's the priest."
Numbers,4,34,"So, Moses, Aaron, and the head honchos of the crew counted the Kohathite dudes, organizing them based on their fams and ancestral homes."
Numbers,4,35,"Anyone between thirty and fifty years old who wants to join the team and help out in the gathering place tent, can totally do it:"
Numbers,4,36,"So, like, the total number of peeps from each fam was, like, 2,750."
Numbers,4,37,"These were the people from the families of the Kohathites who were counted, all those who could help out at the gathering place. Moses and Aaron counted them just as the LORD commanded, through Moses."
Numbers,4,38,"So, like, they like counted the sons of Gershon, you know, like did a head count of their fams and which fathers' houses they belonged to."
Numbers,4,39,"Anyone between the ages of thirty and fifty, who enters into service for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation,"
Numbers,4,40,"So, like, the total count of them, like, within their clans, based on their family lineage, was like, two thousand six hundred and thirty peeps."
Numbers,4,41,"These are the peeps who were counted from the families of the squad of Gershon, all those who could do work in the hangout spot of the crew, who Moses and Aaron counted as per the command of the Big Man Upstairs."
Numbers,4,42,"And the squad of Merari's sons was counted, with each family repping their OG dads' crib,"
Numbers,4,43,"Anyone who's aged thirty or above, all the way up to fifty, and wants to serve in the tabernacle, can do so!"
Numbers,4,44,"So, like, when they counted all the peeps in their fam, there were, like, 3,200 of them."
Numbers,4,45,"So here's the scoop: these are the peeps who got counted out from the Merari fam, you know, Moses and Aaron did the counting, following the word of the big man upstairs, delivered by Moses himself."
Numbers,4,46,"So, Moses, Aaron, and the OG leaders of Israel, counted all them Levites, you know, from each fam and their ancestral house."
Numbers,4,47,Anyone who volunteered for ministry work or helped with the heavy lifting at the meeting place had to be between the ages of thirty and fifty.
Numbers,4,48,"There were like, a total of 8,580 peeps in their crew, no cap."
Numbers,4,49,"As the LORD ordered, Moses counted each person according to their role and responsibility. They were all counted as the LORD commanded Moses."
Numbers,5,1,"Then God was like, 'Yo Moses, listen up,'"
Numbers,5,2,"Tell the kids of Israel to kick out all the people with leprosy, anyone dealing with bodily issues, and anyone who's been around dead bodies."
Numbers,5,3,You gotta remove both dudes and chicks from the camp and keep 'em outside so they don't mess up the camp where I'm chilling.
Numbers,5,4,"So the Israelite squad followed through and kicked them out of the camp, just like the LORD told Moses. They were totally on point, no doubt."
Numbers,5,5,"God hit up Moses and was like,"
Numbers,5,6,"Yo, listen up Israelites! If any dude or chick out here starts doing some shady stuff, like sinning and straight up disrespecting the Lord, they gonna be in trouble, fam."
Numbers,5,7,"So, like, they gotta totally admit their mistake, right? And, um, they gotta make it right by paying back the full amount they owe, plus an extra 20%, and give it to the person they wronged, you know?"
Numbers,5,8,"But if the dude doesn't have any fam to pay back the wrong, then the wrong should be paid to the LORD, like to the priest and stuff. Plus, there's this ram for making up for it, like to make things right and stuff."
Numbers,5,9,"And whatever the kids of Israel give to the priest as their holy stuff, it becomes his. {offering: or, heave offering}"
Numbers,5,10,"And everyone can keep their own sacred things: whatever anyone gives to the priest, it will belong to them."
Numbers,5,11,"So like, God, totally talked to Moses and was like,"
Numbers,5,12,"Yo, kids of Israel, listen up! So, if a dude's wife goes astray and does him dirty,"
Numbers,5,13,"And if a guy hooks up with her without her husband knowing, and they keep it a secret, and she cheats on her husband, and there's no one who saw them, and she doesn't get caught..."
Numbers,5,14,"And if he starts feeling all jealous and suspicious about his wife, thinking she's unfaithful, whether she actually did anything wrong or not,"
Numbers,5,15,"So, the guy needs to take his wife to the priest and give her offering, which is like one-tenth of a basket of barley meal. Don't forget, no oil or fancy stuff like frankincense on it. This offering is to deal with jealousy and remember any wrongdoings, like a reminder."
Numbers,5,16,Then the priest will bring her up and put her in front of the LORD:
Numbers,5,17,"The priest gotta grab some holy water in, like, a clay pot and mix it with a lil' bit of the dust from the floor of the tabernacle. They gotta put that dust right into the water, you know?"
Numbers,5,18,"So, the priest brings the woman before the Lord, removes her head covering, and gives her the jealousy offering to hold. The priest also holds the bitter water that will cause the curse."
Numbers,5,19,"The priest will make her swear and tell her, if no dude has slept with you, and if you haven't cheated on your husband, then you're in the clear from this crazy water that brings a curse."
Numbers,5,20,"But if you've like, cheated on your husband and like, defiled yourself by sleeping with someone else besides your husband:"
Numbers,5,21,"So the priest is gonna call out the woman and make her swear, and he's gonna say to her, 'God's gonna make you a total curse and swear word among your peeps. He's gonna make your leg go gross and your stomach blow up.'"
Numbers,5,22,"And this water that brings the curse will go into your stomach and make your belly swell, and your thigh rot: And the woman will say, Amen, amen."
Numbers,5,23,"The priest gotta jot down all these bad vibes in a book, and then erase 'em with some super salty water:"
Numbers,5,24,"Then he make the woman drink the nasty water that brings the curse, and the water that brings the curse will make her feel bitter."
Numbers,5,25,"Next, the priest takes the jealousy offering from the woman and does this cool wave thing with it in front of the LORD before putting it on the altar:"
Numbers,5,26,"Then the priest grabs a handful of the offering, like a memorial, and burns it on the altar. After that, they make the woman drink the water."
Numbers,5,27,"And once she drinks the water, if she did something wrong and betrayed her husband, then the cursed water will get inside her and make her feel bitter. Her belly will swell up and her thigh will rot. She will be seen as a curse among her people."
Numbers,5,28,"And if the woman is not defiled, but is clean, then she'll be free to conceive."
Numbers,5,29,"Here's the deal when it comes to jealousy: if a wife disses her man and gets with another guy, breaking the trust, and yeah, things get pretty messed up."
Numbers,5,30,"Or when he starts feeling all jealous and possessive about his wife, and decides to bring her before the LORD, and the priest has to follow through with all the rules and punishments."
Numbers,5,31,"So, like, the dude won't be responsible for any wrongdoing, and the girl will have to take the blame for her own wrongdoing."
Numbers,6,1,"So God was like, talking to Moses, and He said,"
Numbers,6,2,"Yo, listen up, Israelites! God's got a message for y'all. If a dude or a chick wants to take a vow as a Nazarite and dedicate themselves to the Lord, they gotta do it right. It's all about that separation, you feel me?"
Numbers,6,3,"He's gotta ditch the booze, no more wine, beer, or any boozy vinegar. Not even grape juice or juicy grapes, fresh or dried. Strictly dry lifestyle."
Numbers,6,4,"During the entire time of their commitment, they must avoid anything made from grapes, from the juicy fruit to the outer shells. 🍇"
Numbers,6,5,"During the entire time of their commitment, they can't shave their head. They have to let their hair grow long as a way of showing they're dedicated to the LORD. It's a symbol of their holiness."
Numbers,6,6,"Whenever he dedicates himself to the LORD, he can't be around any dead peeps."
Numbers,6,7,"He shouldn't do anything that would dishonor his family when they pass away, because he has dedicated himself to God's guidance."
Numbers,6,8,"During his whole separation period, he's completely devoted to the LORD."
Numbers,6,9,"If someone suddenly dies near you and you accidentally mess up your holy head thingy, then you gotta shave your head to get clean, and you gotta do it on the seventh day."
Numbers,6,10,"And like, on the eighth day he's gotta bring, like, two cool turtles or two rad young pigeons to the priest, right at the door of the super chill tabernacle of the crew:"
Numbers,6,11,"The priest will offer one as a sin offering, and the other as a burnt offering, to make things right for them because they messed up with the dead. Then, their head will be consecrated on that very same day."
Numbers,6,12,"So like, he's gotta dedicate himself to God during his time of being set apart, you know? And he's gotta bring a young lamb as an offering to make up for any wrongdoings. But here's the deal, any days that happened before he messed up and defiled his separation, they won't count anymore. They'll just kinda fade away, ya know?"
Numbers,6,13,"Yo, here's the deal for the Nazarite: Once the time of their separation is up, they gotta be taken to the entrance of the tabernacle, where the congregation gathers. It's the law, fam."
Numbers,6,14,"And he's gonna bring his offering to the LORD, like a good vibes only young lamb for a sick burnt offering, and a fly ewe lamb for a lit sin offering, and a rad ram for peace offerings, all of them flawless and looking fresh."
Numbers,6,15,"And a basket of flatbread, delicious cakes made with fancy flour mixed with oil, and crispy unleavened bread soaked in oil, along with their food offering and drink offerings."
Numbers,6,16,"Then the priest gotta bring those offerings right in front of the LORD, and do his thing with the sin offering and burnt offering:"
Numbers,6,17,"And like, he's gonna bring that ram as, you know, a sick offering to the LORD, along with this basket full of like non-leavened bread. The priest will also offer his own cool meat offering and drink offering."
Numbers,6,18,"The Nazarite gotta buzz his hair at the entrance of the meeting spot, then grab those locks and toss 'em in the fire under the peace offerings."
Numbers,6,19,"The priest gonna grab the cooked ram's shoulder, plus one unleavened cake from the basket, and one unleavened wafer. He'll then put 'em on the hands of the Nazarite after their hair has been shaved off as part of their consecration."
Numbers,6,20,"And the priest shall flex them like a wave offering before the LORD: this is lit for the priest, along with the wavy chest and lifted shoulder: and then the Nazarite can turn up with some wine."
Numbers,6,21,"Yo, here's the deal for those Nazarites who made a vow and brought their offering to the LORD as a sign of their dedication, apart from whatever they earn with their own hands. They gotta keep their word and follow all the rules that come with their commitment."
Numbers,6,22,"So, like, God came up to Moses and was like,"
Numbers,6,23,"Yo, Aaron and his squad, listen up. When you talkin' to the kids of Israel, this is how you bless 'em:"
Numbers,6,24,May God bless you and watch over you:
Numbers,6,25,May the LORD light up your life and show you love and kindness:
Numbers,6,26,May God bless you with good vibes and grant you inner peace.
Numbers,6,27,And they gonna flex my name on the squad of Israel; and I'll bless them.
Numbers,7,1,"And one day, when Moses finished putting together the tabernacle and anointing and making it holy, along with all its stuff like the altar and other things, he made them holy too."
Numbers,7,2,"So, like, the leaders of Israel, you know, the big shots from each family and tribe, who were in charge of all the people, they were the ones making the offerings."
Numbers,7,3,"So, they came to the LORD with their gift - six dope wagons covered up, and twelve oxen. Each prince got a wagon for two and an ox for themselves, and they rolled up to the tabernacle with style."
Numbers,7,4,"So, like, God was talking to Moses, you know? And He was all like, 'Yo, Moses, listen up! I got something important to say!'"
Numbers,7,5,"Just grab stuff from them, so they can do their thing at the hangout spot, and hook the Levites up with it based on what they gotta do."
Numbers,7,6,"So Moses grabbed the sick whips and the buff cows, and handed them over to the Levite squad."
Numbers,7,7,"He gave the sons of Gershon two sick wagons and four dope oxen, according to what they had to do:"
Numbers,7,8,"He gave the sons of Merari four cool wagons and eight strong oxen, according to their tasks under the supervision of Ithamar, Aaron the priest's son."
Numbers,7,9,But he didn't assign any tasks to the Kohathites because their job was to carry stuff on their shoulders at the sanctuary.
Numbers,7,10,"And the squad leaders flexed their offerings when they dedicated the altar on the day it was anointed, they flexed their offerings right in front of the altar."
Numbers,7,11,"Then God was like, 'Yo, Moses, tell the princes to bring their offerings on their own designated days to dedicate the altar.'"
Numbers,7,12,"The dude who made his offering on the first day was Nahshon, Amminadab's son, from the tribe of Judah:"

Numbers,8,1,"And God was like, 'Yo, Moses, listen up,'"
Numbers,8,2,"Yo, Aaron! When you light up those lamps, make sure all seven lamps shine bright right across from the candlestick, alright?"
Numbers,8,3,And Aaron did it; he lit the lamps just like the LORD told Moses.
Numbers,8,4,"The candlestick was made of pure gold and had intricate details, like flowers, that were also beaten into shape. It was created exactly as the LORD showed Moses, following the divine blueprint."
Numbers,8,5,"Yo, the LORD totally spoke to Moses, like, straight up said,"
Numbers,8,6,"Yo, pick some Levites from the crew of Israel, and make sure they're clean AF."
Numbers,8,7,"So this is what you gotta do to make things right: Splash them with some cleansing water, totally shave off every hair, give their clothes a good scrub, and they'll be squeaky clean. Yeah, that's how it's done."
Numbers,8,8,"Alright, grab a fresh young bullock and pair it up with a cool meat offering, like some fine flour mixed with oil. Oh, and don't forget to grab another young bullock for a sin offering."
Numbers,8,9,"Yo, bring all the Levites to the tabernacle and gather the entire crew of Israelite homies:"
Numbers,8,10,"And, like, you gotta gather the Levites and bring them before the LORD, ya know? And then, the children of Israel gotta lay their hands on the Levites, for real."
Numbers,8,11,"And Aaron is gonna flex the Levites in front of the LORD, like an offering from the squad of Israel, so they can do their thing for the LORD. Ya know, wave 'em and all that. They gotta execute the service, you know how it is."
Numbers,8,12,"The Levites gonna put their hands on the bullocks' heads: you gonna offer one of 'em as a sin offering, and the other one as a burnt offering, to the LORD, to make things right for the Levites."
Numbers,8,13,"And you'll put the Levites in front of Aaron and his sons, and present them as an offering to the LORD."
Numbers,8,14,"So basically, you gotta pull the Levites aside from all the Israelite kids. Like, they're gonna be exclusively mine, you know?"
Numbers,8,15,"Then the Levites will start doing their thing at the tabernacle, and you gotta make sure they're all clean and offer them as an offering."
Numbers,8,16,"Yo, the children of Israel are like, fully dedicated to me. I've chosen them to be mine, in place of the firstborn of every Israelite. They're all mine, my peeps."
Numbers,8,17,"All the firstborns of the Israelites belong to me, including humans and animals. On the day when I punished the firstborns in Egypt, I set them apart as sacred for myself."
Numbers,8,18,"So like, I chose the Levites to take care of all the firstborn peeps of Israel."
Numbers,8,19,"So, like, I've chosen the Levites to be a special present for Aaron and his sons. They'll be the ones doing all the important work in the tabernacle and making things right for the people of Israel. This way, no bad stuff will happen to the people when they get close to the sanctuary."
Numbers,8,20,"So, like, Moses, Aaron, and all the crew of Israelite peeps, they did exactly what the LORD told Moses to do for the Levites. The whole gang of Israelites followed through on that for them."
Numbers,8,21,"The Levites were like, super clean after they washed their clothes and stuff. Then, Aaron offered them up as an offering to the LORD, and he made sure they were all purified and cleansed. It was like a fresh start for them and all, ya know?"
Numbers,8,22,"And then the Levites went in to do their job in the tabernacle in front of Aaron and his sons, just as the LORD had told Moses to command the Levites. So, the Levites did as they were told."
Numbers,8,23,"God hit up Moses and was like,"
Numbers,8,24,"Here's what the Levites gotta do: once they hit 25, they start serving at the tabernacle. It's like their duty, you know? Can't wait until they're old enough, then they can do all the important stuff there. It's like waging a war, but inside the tabernacle, y'know?"
Numbers,8,25,"Once they hit fifty, they're off duty and don't have to serve anymore. No more going into battle!"
Numbers,8,26,"But they gotta work together with their squad in the tabernacle, doin' their duties, but ain't gotta hustle. That's how you gotta treat the Levites when it comes to their responsibilities."
Numbers,9,1,"So like, God totally talked to Moses while they were chillin' in the middle of nowhere Sinai, about a year after they escaped from Egypt, and this is what He said,"
Numbers,9,2,"Make sure the children of Israel don't forget to celebrate the passover when the time comes, alright?"
Numbers,9,3,"On the fourteenth day of this month, when it gets dark, you gotta celebrate it on time, following all the rituals and ceremonies. {at even: Hebrew for between the two evenings}"
Numbers,9,4,"So Moses talked to the Israelites, telling them to totally celebrate the passover."
Numbers,9,5,"And they totally celebrated the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month, like, in the wilderness of Sinai. They did everything exactly how the LORD told Moses to do it, and the children of Israel were totally on point with that."
Numbers,9,6,"So, there were these guys who, like, touched a dead dude and got all, like, contaminated and stuff. They couldn't celebrate the passover that day. So, they went and talked to Moses and Aaron about it, you know, like asking for help and guidance on what to do. It was a big deal, man."
Numbers,9,7,"And those guys were like, dude, we're totally contaminated by touching a dead body. So, why are we being held back from bringing our offering to the Lord at the right time, with all the other kids in Israel?"
Numbers,9,8,"Moses was like, 'Hold up, fam. Imma wait here and see what the LORD's got to say about y'all.'"
Numbers,9,9,"So like, God was talking to Moses, and He was all like,"
Numbers,9,10,"Yo, listen up! So, God's saying to the peeps of Israel, if any of y'all or your descendants happen to be unclean 'cause of, like, dead bodies or if you're out on a super long trip, don't sweat it. You can still celebrate Passover and show love to the big man upstairs, the LORD."
Numbers,9,11,"On the fourteenth day of the second month, when night falls, it's time to get ready for the feast. Gather around and dig into some tasty unleavened bread and tangy herbs."
Numbers,9,12,"They gotta finish eating it all before the next day, and definitely not mess up any of the bones. Gotta follow all the rules of the passover feast, no exception."
Numbers,9,13,"But if the dude is clean and chillin' at home, and he decides not to celebrate the passover, he's gonna be kicked out of his squad. It's 'cause he didn't bring the offering to the LORD when he was supposed to, so he's gotta own up to his mistake."
Numbers,9,14,"And if someone who's not from around here comes to hang with y'all, and they wanna join in on the passover celebrations to honor the LORD, they gotta follow all the rules and traditions, just like everybody else. We're all in this together, no matter where we're from."
Numbers,9,15,"So, like, when they finished setting up the tabernacle, this totally cool cloud just completely covered it, specifically the tent where they stored the testimony. And when evening came, it looked like there was this rad fire on top of the tabernacle, all the way until morning."
Numbers,9,16,"And it was always like this: the cloud covered it during the day, and there was a lit fire at night."
Numbers,9,17,"So like, once the cloud was all gone from the tabernacle, the Israelites were like, 'Let's go!'. They would set out and camp wherever the cloud stopped and stayed for a bit."
Numbers,9,18,"When the LORD told them to, the peeps of Israel started moving, and when the LORD told them to stop, they set up camp. They chilled in their tents as long as that cloud stayed put on the tabernacle."
Numbers,9,19,"And like, when the cloud hung out over the tabernacle for, like, a super long time, the children of Israel were, like, totally on point and didn't go anywhere, because that's what the LORD wanted. #nohurry"
Numbers,9,20,"So, like, the cloud hung around the tabernacle for a little while, and as the LORD said, they stayed in their tents, and then they moved when the LORD said so."
Numbers,9,21,"So, like, when the cloud hung around from evening until morning, and when the cloud lifted in the morning, they started moving. Whether it was during the day or at night when the cloud lifted, they kept on moving."
Numbers,9,22,"Whether it was chillin' for two days, a whole month, or even a whole year, whenever that cloud hung out on the tabernacle, the squad of Israelites would stay kickin' it in their tents, not goin' anywhere. But as soon as that cloud was lifted, it was time to hit the road, no time to waste."
Numbers,9,23,"The squad listened up when the LORD gave the word to chill in their tents, and when the LORD said it's time to roll, they moved out. They stayed loyal to the LORD, following Moses as their guide, just as the LORD commanded."
Numbers,10,1,"And God was like, yo Moses, listen up,"
Numbers,10,2,"Yo, make two lit silver trumpets, all in one piece. It's for calling the squad together and letting 'em know it's time to move camps."
Numbers,10,3,"And when they sound the alarm, everyone should gather at the entrance of the meeting spot."
Numbers,10,4,"And if they sound with just one trumpet, then the leaders, who are in charge of the thousands of Israel, will come together with you."
Numbers,10,5,"When you sound an alarm, the camps on the east side shall move ahead."
Numbers,10,6,"When you sound the horn again, the camps on the south side will start moving. They will sound the horn to signal their journey."
Numbers,10,7,"But when the squad's all chillin' and it's time to meet up, you can bring the vibes with a little blow, just don't go all extra and sound the alarm, ya feel me?"
Numbers,10,8,"So like, Aaron's sons, the priests, gotta blast those trumpets, okay? It's gonna be a forever thing, like for all y'all in the fam, ya dig?"
Numbers,10,9,"If you find yourself in a battle on your own turf against your oppressors, make some noise with those trumpets! God will take notice, and He'll help you kick some enemy butt."
Numbers,10,10,"And when you're having a lit day, or on those special occasions, or at the start of each month, make sure to blast those trumpets to show your appreciation for the sacrifices you've made. It's like a reminder to God that you're grateful. And just so you know, I'm the LORD your God."
Numbers,10,11,"So, like, on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, the cloud was, like, totally gone from the tabernacle of the testimony."
Numbers,10,12,"So the Israelites started moving from the desert of Sinai, and the cool cloud settled in the desert of Paran."
Numbers,10,13,"So they set off, totally following what the LORD told them through Moses."
Numbers,10,14,"First up, the camp of the kids from Judah was led by Nahshon, Amminadab's offspring. They had their own cool flag and everything."
Numbers,10,15,"And leading the crew from the tribe of Issachar was Nethaneel, who happened to be Zuar's son."
Numbers,10,16,"And in charge of the crew from the Zebulun squad was Eliab, Helon's son."
Numbers,10,17,"So the tent was packed up, and the Gershon and Merari fams rolled out, carrying the tent with them."
Numbers,10,18,"Then Reuben's squad started moving, organized according to their groups, with Elizur, Shedeur's son, leading over them."
Numbers,10,19,"And in charge of the tribe of the Simeon gang was Shelumiel, son of Zurishaddai."
Numbers,10,20,"And in charge of the squad from the tribe of Gad was Eliasaph, son of Deuel."
Numbers,10,21,"So the Kohathites moved ahead, carrying the holy stuff, while the others set up the tabernacle before they arrived. (Those others being the Gershonites and the Merarites.)"
Numbers,10,22,"The crew of the Ephraim squad moved out, organized by their squads, with Elishama, the son of Ammihud, leading them."
Numbers,10,23,"And Gamaliel, son of Pedahzur, was in charge of the tribe of the children of Manasseh."
Numbers,10,24,"Leading the crew of the Benjamin squad was Abidan, Gideoni's offspring."
Numbers,10,25,"So the Dan squad, the rearguard of all the camps, moved out with their crew. Ahiezer, Ammishaddai's son, was in charge of their squad."
Numbers,10,26,"And leading the tribe of Asher's crew was Pagiel, Ocran's son!"
Numbers,10,27,"And leading the crew of the tribe of the Naphtali peeps was Ahira, Enan's son."
Numbers,10,28,"So, like, this is how the Israelites moved around with their crew, you know, when they were on the move. Like, they had their squads and all, and that's how they rolled out. And I mean, when I say 'these,' it's like the Hebrew word for 'them,' just so you're in the loop."
Numbers,10,29,"So Moses was like, 'Yo Hobab, bro. You're Raguel's kid, right? Well, listen up. Our crew is headed to this rad spot that the LORD promised to give us. You should totally roll with us, man. We've got your back and things are gonna be super awesome for Israel, 'cause the LORD's got good things in store!'"
Numbers,10,30,"And he was like, um, no way; I'm totally gonna dip and go back to my own turf and chill with my fam."
Numbers,10,31,"And he was like, dude, please don't peace out on us. You're our wilderness expert, and you can be our eyes out here, you know?"
Numbers,10,32,"If you come with us, we'll treat you just as well as the LORD treats us!"
Numbers,10,33,"So they left the LORD's mountain and traveled for three whole days. And the sacred ark, representing God's agreement, led the way on this journey, searching for a perfect spot where they could finally rest."
Numbers,10,34,"And the LORD's cool vibes followed them during the day, whenever they dipped out of the camp."
Numbers,10,35,"When the ark was on the move, Moses said, 'Yo, Lord, get up and make your enemies peace out and let those who hate you bounce.'"
Numbers,10,36,"And once it stopped, he said, 'Come back, LORD, to the massive crowd of Israel, with countless thousands.'"
Numbers,11,1,"So, like, when the people started whining, it really ticked off the LORD. And the LORD totally listened to their complaints, which made him super mad. And then the LORD's anger got so intense, it was like a raging fire that scorched the outskirts of the camp and totally consumed those who were causing all the fuss. (BTW, when I say 'complained', I mean they were kinda acting like complainers, you know? And when I say 'it displeased', I mean it was totally annoying to the LORD.)"
Numbers,11,2,"So the people were like, Mosess, help us!' And Moses was all like, 'Yo, God, can you do something about this fire?' And boom, just like that, the fire was put out."
Numbers,11,3,"And he was like, 'Okay, let's name this place Taberah, cuz, you know, the fire of the LORD was straight up burning in there.' {Taberah: which literally means fire burning and stuff.}"
Numbers,11,4,"And the diverse group of people who were with them began to crave and desire things they shouldn't: and the children of Israel started crying again, saying, who can provide us with meat to eat? They couldn't help their cravings and started shedding tears again."
Numbers,11,5,"Yo, we still think about those lit fish we used to grub on back in Egypt like it was no biggie. And don't even get me started on the vibes of them cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic, they were straight fire."
Numbers,11,6,"But, like, our soul is totally drained: there's legit nothing else here except this manna, right in front of us."
Numbers,11,7,The manna looked like tiny coriander seeds and had a color similar to that of bdellium.
Numbers,11,8,"So, the people went around and collected it, and ground it up in mills, or crushed it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made yummy cakes out of it. And let me tell you, it tasted just as good as fresh oil!"
Numbers,11,9,"And like, when it got all misty at night in the camp, this super cool thing called manna fell from the sky and landed on it, you know?"
Numbers,11,10,"So, like, Moses heard the peeps cryin' all over their fams, with every dude postin' up by their tents. And man, the LORD got super ticked off, which totally didn't sit well with Moses, either."
Numbers,11,11,"So, like, Moses straight up asked God, 'Why are you making things so hard for me? Did I do something to annoy you or what, because it feels like you're dumping all of these responsibilities on me without showing me any love or support?'"
Numbers,11,12,"Did I give birth to all these people? Am I their creator just so you can ask me to hold them close like a caring father holding a helpless baby, and lead them to the promised land that you promised their ancestors?"
Numbers,11,13,"Where am I supposed to get enough food to feed all these people? They keep crying to me, demanding meat to eat."
Numbers,11,14,"I can't handle all these people by myself, it's way too overwhelming for me."
Numbers,11,15,"And, like, if you're gonna keep treating me like this, just end me right now, please. But, hey, only if I've done something to earn your approval. I'd rather not witness how miserable my life has become."
Numbers,11,16,"So, like, the LORD was talking to Moses and he was like, 'Yo, Moses, round up seventy dudes who are like the OGs of Israel and they're basically in charge, and bring 'em to the tent where we all meet up, so they can stand with you.'"
Numbers,11,17,"And I'll slide into the DMs and have a convo with you there: and I'll download the vibe that you've got, and I'll spread it to them too; and they'll share the load of dealing with the people, so you don't have to carry it all by yourself."
Numbers,11,18,"Yo, tell the peeps to get themselves ready for tomorrow, 'cause we're about to feast on some delicious meat! Y'all been crying to the Lord, talking about who's gonna hook us up with some meat to eat, like we had it good back in Egypt or something. Well, guess what? The Lord heard ya and He's gonna come through with that meat. So get hyped, 'cause we're about to chow down!"
Numbers,11,19,"Guys, don't even think about indulging in some good eats for just one day, or two days, or five days, not even ten days, or twenty days!"
Numbers,11,20,"Like, seriously, for like a whole month, until it's like coming out of your nose and totally grossing you out: because you straight up dissed the LORD who's right there with you, and like cried to Him saying, 'Why did we even leave Egypt, bro?'"
Numbers,11,21,"So Moses was like, 'Yo, there's like 600k people here, and You're saying You gonna give 'em meat to eat for a whole month? That's wild.'"
Numbers,11,22,"Like, are they seriously expecting us to slaughter a bunch of animals just to feed them? Or are they thinking we can magically gather all the fish in the sea to satisfy their cravings?"
Numbers,11,23,"And God was like, Mosess, seriously? Do you think I suddenly lost my power? Watch and see if what I've said will actually happen or not.'"
Numbers,11,24,"So Moses dipped out and dropped some knowledge on the people, sharing the words of the LORD. He gathered the seventy OGs of the community and had them chill around the tabernacle."
Numbers,11,25,"And, like, God came down in a totally epic cloud and had a chat with him. Then, God was like, 'Yo dudes, check this out,' and He took some of the mad awesome spirit that was on him and straight up handed it over to the seventy elders. And you won't believe it, but when that spirit landed on them, they started prophesying like non-stop, for real!"
Numbers,11,26,"So there were these two dudes back in the camp, one named Eldad and the other named Medad. But get this, the spirit of God came upon them, even though they didn't go out to the sacred tent like the others. And guess what? They started prophesying right there in the camp!"
Numbers,11,27,"Then this dude came running up to Moses and was like, 'Yo, Eldad and Medad are out here prophesying in the camp!"
Numbers,11,28,"So Joshua, Moses' homie and servant, one of his squad, was like, yo Moses, chill out and don't let them do that."
Numbers,11,29,"Moses was like, 'Are you jelly of me, bro? I wish everyone was a prophet and had the Lord's spirit on them! How epic would that be! 🙌"
Numbers,11,30,"So Moses went with the squad, him and the OGs of Israel."
Numbers,11,31,"So like, the Lord sent a really strong wind that brought a bunch of quails from the sea and let them fall all around the camp. It was like a day's journey on one side, and then a day's journey on the other side, surrounding the whole camp. And the quails were like two cubits high above the ground, just covering everything. It was like a huge feast for them!"
Numbers,11,32,"So, like, the people were standing up all day and all night, and even the next day, gathering these quails. The one who collected the least ended up with like ten homers, man! And then they spread them all around the camp, making sure everyone got their share."
Numbers,11,33,"And just as they were still chewing on the meat, before they even finished it, God got super angry at the people and hit them with a really bad sickness."
Numbers,11,34,"And he named that place Kibrothhattaavah, 'cause that's where they buried all those pleasure-seekers. {Kibrothhattaavah: which means, The graves of desire}"
Numbers,11,35,"And the squad moved from Kibrothhattaavah to Hazeroth; and crashed at Hazeroth. (crashed: like, they set up camp, you know?)"
Numbers,12,1,"So Miriam and Aaron had a problem with Moses because he married an Ethiopian woman. Yeah, he went and tied the knot with someone from Ethiopia! (By the way, Ethiopian means Cushite, just FYI.)"
Numbers,12,2,"And they were like, 'Wait, did God only speak through Moses? Like, didn't He also speak through us?' And then God was like, 'Yup, I totally heard that.'"
Numbers,12,3,"(O-M-G, Moses was, like, hella humble, even more than anyone else on the planet.)"
Numbers,12,4,"So, like, out of nowhere, the LORD was all like, 'Hey Moses, Aaron, Miriam, come meet me at the tabernacle, stat!' And, guess what? Yup, the three of them actually went there, no questions asked."
Numbers,12,5,"Then God came down from the sky, in a super cool cloud, and stood at the entrance of the holy tent. He called out to Aaron and Miriam, and they both went to Him."
Numbers,12,6,"Yo, listen up! If there's a prophetic homie among you, I, the LORD, will straight up reveal myself to them in a vision or chat them up in a dream."
Numbers,12,7,"Moses, my servant, is totally real, like, super reliable in taking care of all my stuff."
Numbers,12,8,"I'm gonna have a direct convo with him, no shady talk, and he's gonna see a clear vision of the LORD. So why weren't you scared to diss my boy Moses?"
Numbers,12,9,"God got really mad at them, so He stormed off."
Numbers,12,10,"And the cloud left the tent, and guess what? Miriam suddenly got this skin condition, like really pale, like snow. And Aaron saw Miriam, and, whoa, she had the same skin condition too!"
Numbers,12,11,"Yo Moses, my dude, please don't blame us for this dumb mistake we made and the sin we committed. It's a total facepalm moment, bro."
Numbers,12,12,"Don't let her be like a total zombie, all flesh half eaten up when she's born."
Numbers,12,13,"And Moses hit up the big man upstairs like, 'Yo Lord, I'm begging you, can you please fix her up?'"
Numbers,12,14,"And God was like, 'Yo Moses, if her dad just dissed her, wouldn't she be mad embarrassed for a whole week? Kick her out of the squad for a week, and then she can come back and chill with us."
Numbers,12,15,"So Miriam got excluded from the gang for a whole week, and the squad didn't even move forward without her being let back in."
Numbers,12,16,Then the crew bounced from Hazeroth and set up camp in the wildlands of Paran.
Numbers,13,1,"So like, God was all like, 'Yo Moses, listen up,'"
Numbers,13,2,"Yo, pick some peeps to scope out Canaan, the land I'm hookin' up to the children of Israel. Send a representative from each tribe, ya know, a legit leader."
Numbers,13,3,"So Moses, following God's orders, sent them out from the wildnerness of Paran. All of those guys were leaders of the Israelite squad."
Numbers,13,4,"And these were their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua, who was the son of Zaccur."
Numbers,13,5,"Representing the squad of Simeon, we have Shaphat, Hori's offspring."
Numbers,13,6,"Representing Judah, we got Caleb, son of Jephunneh."
Numbers,13,7,"Igal, the dude who's Joseph's son, represents the tribe of Issachar."
Numbers,13,8,"Representing the Ephraim fam, we got Oshea, AKA Joshua, the son of Nun."
Numbers,13,9,"Representing Benjamin, we got Palti, the offspring of Raphu."
Numbers,13,10,"Representing the Zebulun squad, we got Gaddiel, Sodi's offspring in the mix."
Numbers,13,11,"Representing Team Joseph, specifically from the squad of Manasseh, we have Gaddi, Susi's child."
Numbers,13,12,"Ammiel, the son of Gemalli, representing the Dan tribe."
Numbers,13,13,"Representin' the Asher squad, we got Sethur holdin' it down as Michael's son."
Numbers,13,14,"Representing the Naphtali squad, we got Nahbi, Vophsi's offspring."
Numbers,13,15,"Representin' the tribe of Gad, we got Geuel, son of Machi."
Numbers,13,16,"These are the guys that Moses sent to scope out the land. And Moses gave Oshea, aka Joshua, the nickname Jehoshua."
Numbers,13,17,"So Moses sent them to check out the land of Canaan and told them, 'Go up this road in the south and head towards the mountains.'"
Numbers,13,18,"Check out the land and peep the scene, see who's living there - are they flexin' or kinda weak, a small squad or a massive crew?"
Numbers,13,19,"So, like, they were checking out the land where these people live, you know? They wanted to know if it was a good place or a total dump. And they also wanted to scope out the cities they were living in—whether they were chilling in tents or hiding out in fortresses, you feel me?"
Numbers,13,20,"Yo, check out what the land is like. Is it rich or nah? Any dope trees around? Don't be scared, fam. Confidence is key. Bring back some tasty fruits from the land. It's grape season, y'all!"
Numbers,13,21,"So they went up and explored the land from the desert of Zin all the way to Rehob, like people reaching Hamath."
Numbers,13,22,"So, they headed south and reached Hebron where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, who were the children of Anak, were chilling. (By the way, Hebron was actually built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)"
Numbers,13,23,"So they went to this really cool place called Eshcol and found this huge bunch of grapes. They decided to carry it on a stick together with their friends. Also, they picked some pomegranates and figs!"
Numbers,13,24,"That spot got the name Eshcol, 'cause it had a mad bunch of grapes that the Israelite crew snatched up. {brook: or, valley} {Eshcol: as in, A cluster of grapes}"
Numbers,13,25,"And after like, 40 days of checking out the land, they came back, you know?"
Numbers,13,26,"So they went and met up with Moses, Aaron, and all the Israelites out in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh. They reported to them and showed everyone the awesome fruit they had found."
Numbers,13,27,"So we were like, 'Hey, we went to that place you sent us to, and dude, it's amazing! It's full of good stuff like milk and honey. And check out these fruits we brought back!"
Numbers,13,28,"But yo, the peeps living in that land be mad strong, and the cities be like protected with hella big walls and all. Plus, we spotted these straight-up giants, the children of Anak, in there."
Numbers,13,29,"Bruh, the Amalekites are chilling down in the southern lands, while the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites are posted up in the mountains. The Canaanites are holding it down by the sea and the coast of Jordan, you feel me?"
Numbers,13,30,"So Caleb gathered everyone around Moses and said, 'Yo, let's charge straight up and claim that land as ours! We got this, fam. We totally have what it takes to conquer it!'"
Numbers,13,31,"But the dudes who rolled with him were like, nah bro, we can't take on those people 'cause they're way more buff than us."
Numbers,13,32,"So, they totally trashed the land they explored to the Israelites, saying, 'Dude, this place totally eats people alive! And the people we saw there? Taller than giants, man!'"
Numbers,13,33,"So like, we saw these super tall dudes, the sons of Anak, who were like descendants of even taller dudes. And you know what? We felt so tiny, like grasshoppers, compared to them. And it seemed like that's how they saw us too."
Numbers,14,1,"And like, everyone in the group started shouting and crying, and the peeps were super emotional that night."
Numbers,14,2,"And all the Israelite kids were like ugh, Moses and Aaron are so annoying. The whole crew was like, I wish we were dead in Egypt! No wait, I wish we were dead in this boring wilderness!"
Numbers,14,3,Why did God bring us to this place just to get killed and let our families be taken captive? Wouldn't it be better for us to go back to Egypt?
Numbers,14,4,"And they were like, yo, let's choose a leader and bounce back to Egypt."
Numbers,14,5,"So Moses and Aaron totally dropped to the ground in front of everyone, like, the whole crew of Israelite peeps."
Numbers,14,6,"Joshua, son of Nun, and Caleb, son of Jephunneh, who were part of the land scouting crew, tore their clothes in distress."
Numbers,14,7,"So they said to all the squad of Israel, like, yo, the land we checked out is legit amazing, no cap."
Numbers,14,8,"If God thinks we're cool, he'll totally hook us up with this awesome land that's like super abundant, with milk and honey all flowing and stuff."
Numbers,14,9,"Don't go against the LORD, and don't be scared of the people in the land. They're basically no match for us. They have no protection, but we have the LORD on our side. So, don't be afraid of them."
Numbers,14,10,"But everyone there was like, 'Let's pelt them with stones!' Then, out of nowhere, God's amazing presence showed up in the meeting place where everyone could see, right in front of the whole Israelite crew."
Numbers,14,11,"Yo, Moses! Seriously, how much longer are these people gonna keep testing my patience? Like, when will they finally have some faith in me, especially after all the crazy miracles I've shown them?"
Numbers,14,12,"I'm gonna hit them with a major plague, kick them out of their land, and turn you into a way cooler nation that's way more powerful than them."
Numbers,14,13,"So Moses was like, 'Yo God, if we do this, the Egyptians gonna hear about it and they gonna be shook 'cause you straight flexed your power and brought the Israelites out from among them and all.'"
Numbers,14,14,"And they'll be like, 'Yo, the people of this place need to know that the Lord is with them. They've heard that the Lord is chilling right here, like no distance. The Lord's cloud is always over them, leading the way during the day as a cloud and at night as fire."
Numbers,14,15,"Yo, if you straight up wipe out these peeps like they're all just one person, then all these nations who've heard about you gonna be like,"
Numbers,14,16,"So, like, God couldn't actually get these people into the land He promised them. That's why He ended up, you know, taking them out in the wilderness and stuff."
Numbers,14,17,"Yo, I'm humbly asking you to flex your mad power, just like you promised,"
Numbers,14,18,"God is super patient, totally merciful, forgives all the bad stuff we do, but makes sure justice is served. Sometimes the consequences of our ancestors' wrongdoings can affect us too, for a few generations."
Numbers,14,19,"Like, oh my gosh, please forgive the wrongdoings of these peeps in the most epic way possible, just as you have forgiven them since the time they left Egypt until now. (or, like, until now or whatever)"
Numbers,14,20,"And God was like, 'You know what? I'm totally forgiving you, just like you asked!'"
Numbers,14,21,"I swear, bro, the entire world will be lit with the glory of the LORD."
Numbers,14,22,"So, like, all those dudes who witnessed the epicness of my divine awesomeness and witnessed the sick miracles I pulled off back in Egypt and the wild, they've straight-up tested me ten times now and totally ignored what I've been saying."
Numbers,14,23,"I tell you, they won't even catch a glimpse of the promised land I promised their ancestors. Those who've been giving me trouble won't see it either. #NoLandForThem #PromisedButNotDelivered"
Numbers,14,24,"But my dude Caleb, because he had this whole different vibe going on, and straight up followed me to the max, I'm gonna bring him into the land he checked out; and his offspring will totally own it."
Numbers,14,25,"So, like, there were these Amalekites and Canaanites chillin' in the valley, you know? Tomorrow, head out to the wilderness via the Red Sea route, fam."
Numbers,14,26,"So like, the LORD was talking to Moses and Aaron, right? And He's all like,"
Numbers,14,27,"Yo, how much longer do I have to put up with this whack group of people who keep complaining about me? I've been hearing their constant complaints, like, seriously, why are the children of Israel always dissing me?"
Numbers,14,28,"Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD is sayin': I swear on my life, whatever you've been chattin' about, I'ma make it happen, no cap."
Numbers,14,29,"Y'all gonna drop dead in this desert; all of you, from 20 and up, who complained about me, will be taken out, and I totally counted every single one of you."
Numbers,14,30,"For sure, you guys won't enter the land that I promised to give you as a place to live, except for Caleb, son of Jephunneh, and Joshua, son of Nun. Just so you know, I made a solemn commitment to this."
Numbers,14,31,"But those younger ones you thought would be left behind as victims, I will bring them in and they will experience the land that you underestimated."
Numbers,14,32,"But like, you guys, your bodies are totally gonna drop dead in this desert."
Numbers,14,33,"And your kids will be stuck in the desert for, like, forty years, dealing with the consequences of your messed up choices, until you all basically die out there. *shrugs*"
Numbers,14,34,"Once you finished exploring the land, which took a total of forty days (that's, like, a year for each day), you'll have to deal with the consequences of your wrongdoings for the next forty years. And during that time, you'll come to realize how I had to change my plans because of your actions."
Numbers,14,35,"Yo, the LORD Himself promised that He's gonna totally wreck this entire messed up group of people that have gathered against Me. Like, in this wilderness, they're gonna meet their end and kick the bucket right here."
Numbers,14,36,"So like, those guys that Moses sent to check out the land totally came back and started stirring up drama among all the people by spreading lies about it."
Numbers,14,37,"Like, those guys who spread negativity about the land totally didn't make it, they got hit with a major plague in front of the LORD."
Numbers,14,38,"But Joshua, the OG son of Nun, and Caleb, the cool son of Jephunneh, were part of the squad that checked out the land, and they were still killing it."
Numbers,14,39,"So Moses pulled the squad together and dropped these truth bombs on all the Israelites. And let me tell you, the whole crew was in serious feels mode, like major mourning vibes."
Numbers,14,40,"So, like, they woke up super early in the morning and headed to the tippy top of the mountain, being like, 'Yo, we're here and we're totally gonna reach the place that the LORD promised us, 'cause we messed up, man.'"
Numbers,14,41,"Yo, Moses was like, why y'all gotta go against the LORD's commandment? But let me tell ya, it ain't gonna work out for you."
Numbers,14,42,"Don't even think about heading up there, because the LORD ain't gonna be there with you. You'll end up getting totally wrecked by your enemies."
Numbers,14,43,"Yo, listen up! The Amalekites and Canaanites are chillin' in that place ahead of ya, and y'all gonna get wrecked by the sword. It's 'cause you've straight-up abandoned the LORD, so He ain't gonna roll with you no more."
Numbers,14,44,"But they decided to go up to the hilltop, even though the sacred box of the LORD's covenant and Moses stayed in the camp."
Numbers,14,45,"So the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that area came down and totally destroyed them, all the way to Hormah."
Numbers,15,1,"And God started talking to Moses, like,"
Numbers,15,2,"Yo, listen up, all you Israelites! So, when you finally step foot into the sweet land I'm hooking you up with for your homes,"
Numbers,15,3,"And you shall offer a lit fire to the LORD, like a sick burn or a flex for keeping a promise, or for doing something on your own, or during lit celebrations, to make it super dope for the LORD. Whether it's from your squad or your crew, it's all good! {separating: separating it from everything else}"
Numbers,15,4,"Yo, if someone wants to offer a gift to the LORD, they gotta bring a lit meat offering. It's gotta be like one-tenth of flour mixed with one-fourth of oil, ya know?"
Numbers,15,5,"And you're gonna need like a fourth of a hin of wine - seriously, just a lil' bit - for a drink offering to go with the burnt offering or sacrifice, ya know, when you bring in one lamb."
Numbers,15,6,"Dude, if you're sacrificing a ram, you gotta bring like two tenth deals of flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil as an offering, ya know?"
Numbers,15,7,"And when it comes to offering a drink, you gotta bring about one-third of a hin of wine. It's gotta be a real sweet scent for the LORD."
Numbers,15,8,"And when you're getting ready to offer a bullock to God as a burnt offering, or as a sacrifice to fulfill a vow, or as peace offerings to the LORD:"
Numbers,15,9,"Then he should bring, like, a bullock and offer three tenth deals of flour mixed with half a hin of oil."
Numbers,15,10,"And you gotta pour in half a hin of wine as a drink offering, like an offering that's lit and pleases the Lord."
Numbers,15,11,"So this is how it should be for one bullock, or one ram, or a lamb, or a kid. 👌"
Numbers,15,12,Just do it; give everyone what they deserve based on how many they are.
Numbers,15,13,"So, like, everyone who's from around here should totally follow these rules when they bring their fire offerings, you know? They gotta make sure it's all tasty and pleasing to the LORD."
Numbers,15,14,"And if a random person comes chill with you, or anyone who's part of your squad, and wants to make a lit offering by burning something tasty for the LORD, they gotta follow the same vibes as you do."
Numbers,15,15,"Here's the deal, fam: the same rules go for all of y'all in the community, whether you're a local or just visiting. This rule is gonna stick around forever, for all generations. Just remember, the way you're treated by the big man upstairs, the strangers among you get the same treatment. No exceptions."
Numbers,15,16,"We all follow the same rules, whether you're chillin' with us or you're a visitor."
Numbers,15,17,"So, like, God was talking to Moses and stuff, and He was like,"
Numbers,15,18,"Yo, listen up, Israelites! Hear this from the man upstairs: Once you arrive in the promised land that I'm taking you to,"
Numbers,15,19,"So, like, when you chow down on that bread from the land, you gotta make sure to give an offering to the LORD, you know?"
Numbers,15,20,"Yo, gotta give up a lit cake made from the first of yo dough as an offering. Like the offering from the threshingfloor, ya gotta lift it up, ya feel me?"
Numbers,15,21,Always remember to dedicate a portion of your dough as an offering to the LORD for generations to come.
Numbers,15,22,"And if you've messed up and haven't followed all these rules that the LORD told Moses,"
Numbers,15,23,"Like, every single thing that the Lord told you through Moses, starting from way back when He first commanded Moses and continuing on throughout the generations, ya know?"
Numbers,15,24,"So, like, if anyone does something dumb without even realizing it, and nobody else knows about it, the whole crew should come together and offer a lit young bull as a burnt offering to the Lord, along with a meal and a refreshing drink, just like the usual vibe. Also, bring a cool goat as a sin offering. It's, like, the way we do things, you know?"
Numbers,15,25,"And the priest gotta make everything cool for the whole squad of the Israelite peeps, and they'll get forgiven 'cause, you know, they just didn't know. And they gotta bring their own offering, like a lit fire sacrifice to the big man upstairs, and also their sin offering, 'cause of the whole not-knowing situation."
Numbers,15,26,"And like, everyone in the Israel fam and even the visitors who chill with them will totally be forgiven. 'Cause, you know, they were all just clueless and didn't know any better."
Numbers,15,27,"If someone messes up unintentionally, they gotta bring a young she goat as an offering to make up for the sin, ya feel me?"
Numbers,15,28,"The priest will fix things up for someone who messes up unknowingly, if they mess up without knowing it in front of the LORD. The priest will make things right for them and they'll be forgiven."
Numbers,15,29,"Everyone's gotta follow the same rules, whether you're an Israelite or just visiting. It doesn't matter if you mess up accidentally or if you were born here, the law treats everyone the same."
Numbers,15,30,"But if someone intentionally does something they know is wrong, whether they were born here or not, they're disrespecting the LORD and will be rejected by their community."
Numbers,15,31,"If someone disses the word of the LORD and breaks his commandment, they're out. Their mistakes are on them."
Numbers,15,32,"So, like, when the Israelites were out there in the wilderness, they came across this dude who was picking up sticks on the sabbath day."
Numbers,15,33,"So, like, these peeps caught this guy picking up sticks and were all like, 'dude, you're breaking the rules.' So they took him to Moses, Aaron, and the whole crew."
Numbers,15,34,"So they locked him up, because they weren't sure what to do with him yet."
Numbers,15,35,"Then God told Moses, like, this guy seriously deserves death. So, the whole crew gotta grab some rocks and throw 'em at him outside the camp."
Numbers,15,36,"So, like, the whole crew took him outside the camp and straight up threw rocks at him until he kicked the bucket. It was totally what the LORD told Moses to do."
Numbers,15,37,"So God was like, talking to Moses, and He was like,"
Numbers,15,38,"Yo, listen up Israelites! Tell 'em to add some lit fringes to the ends of their clothes, and make sure to rock a sick blue ribbon on those fringes. This style is gonna be passed down for generations, fam!"
Numbers,15,39,"And this is like a reminder for you, so you always remember God's commandments and actually follow them. It's a way to keep yourself from getting distracted by your own desires and wandering off track."
Numbers,15,40,"So you don't forget, follow all my rules and be totally devoted to your God."
Numbers,15,41,"Yo, I'm the LORD your God, the one who snatched you out of Egypt and became your ultimate squad. I'm always gonna be the LORD your God, no doubt."
Numbers,16,1,"So this dude named Korah, who was the son of Izhar, who was the son of Kohath, who was the son of Levi, along with Dathan and Abiram, who were the sons of Eliab, and On, who was the son of Peleth, and also sons of Reuben, they got together a group of people:"
Numbers,16,2,"And then these guys, like, totally confronted Moses, right? It was, like, two hundred and fifty top dogs from the Israel crew. They were, like, basically famous in the squad, well-known and all that."
Numbers,16,3,"So like, the whole crew got together and started beefing with Moses and Aaron, telling them they're acting all high and mighty. They were like, 'Why do you think you're so special? We're all chosen by the Lord and He's with us!' They basically called them out for thinking they're better than the rest of us."
Numbers,16,4,"And when Moses heard that, he face-planted:"
Numbers,16,5,"And he was like, yo Korah and all his homies, listen up. Tomorrow, the LORD is gonna flex and make it clear who's on his team and who's holy. He'll bring them close to him, like VIP status – the ones he's chosen."
Numbers,16,6,"Okay, listen up fam! Grab those censers, Korah, and everyone in his crew!"
Numbers,16,7,"And like, you gotta add fire and incense in there, in front of the LORD tomorrow, okay? And it's gonna be like, whoever the LORD chooses, that dude is gonna be totally holy. So, like, chill out guys, you sons of Levi, you're doing too much."
Numbers,16,8,"Yo, Moses be like, listen up, fam. I'm talking to you, my fellow Levi homies:"
Numbers,16,9,"Seriously, dude, is it no biggie to you that the God of Israel chose y'all over everyone else to join His crew and do important stuff at His HQ, the tabernacle of the LORD? You get to be up front and center, serving the congregation and doing your thing. Cool or what?"
Numbers,16,10,"And he's like, yo, he's bringing you close to him, and all your homies from the tribe of Levi too. And he's asking, are you guys also trying to join the priesthood?"
Numbers,16,11,"Yo, why are you and your whole crew straight up hating on the LORD? And why you gotta complain about Aaron like that, for real?"
Numbers,16,12,"So Moses hit up Dathan and Abiram, Eliab's sons, and they straight up said, 'Nah, we ain't showing up!'"
Numbers,16,13,"Like, are you seriously gonna kill us here in the desert after bringing us out of a totally awesome land flowing with milk and honey? Unless you're planning to make yourself the ultimate ruler, that's like totally extra."
Numbers,16,14,"And, like, you totally didn't bring us to a rad land filled with epic stuff like milk and honey, or hook us up with sweet fields and vineyards. Are you seriously trying to blindside us here? Sorry, but we're not down to go along with that plan. #NoThanks"
Numbers,16,15,"Moses got mad AF and was like, Yo God, don't even bother with their lame offering. I never asked for a single donkey from them and I haven't harmed any of them either."
Numbers,16,16,"So Moses said to Korah, yo gather up yourself, your squad, and Aaron, and come before the LORD, like tomorrow, fam:"
Numbers,16,17,"Yo, everyone grab your censers and fill 'em up with incense. Then bring 'em all before the LORD - two hundred and fifty censers in total. And don't forget, both you and Aaron gotta bring your own censers too!"
Numbers,16,18,"So they each grabbed their censers, filled them with fire, put incense on top, and stood at the entrance of the tabernacle with Moses and Aaron."
Numbers,16,19,"So Korah got everyone together and brought them to the entrance of the sacred tent. Then, BAM! The Lord's divine presence showed up and all the people saw it."
Numbers,16,20,"So God was like, 'Yo, Moses and Aaron, listen up,'"
Numbers,16,21,"Yo, y'all better bounce from this squad ASAP, 'cause I'm about to straight up obliterate 'em in a hot sec."
Numbers,16,22,"And they totally dropped to the ground and were like, Yo God, the God of all the vibes and energies of everyone, is it fair for just one person to mess up and then you get mad at the whole squad?"
Numbers,16,23,"And God like totally talked to Moses, and He was all like, 'Yo, listen up,'"
Numbers,16,24,"Yo, gather 'round and listen up! It's time to bounce from the area near the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram."
Numbers,16,25,"So Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the older guys from Israel went with him."
Numbers,16,26,"So he talked to all the people and was like, 'Yo, listen up! Peace out from the wicked dudes' spot and don't even touch their stuff. 'Cause if you do, you might end up getting wrecked by all their bad vibes."
Numbers,16,27,"So they left the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram from all directions: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the entrance of their tents, with their wives, and their sons, and their little children."
Numbers,16,28,"And Moses was like, listen up fam, this is how you'll know that the big man upstairs sent me to pull off all these crazy miracles. It ain't like I came up with this stuff all on my own, I'm just doing what He told me to do."
Numbers,16,29,"If these dudes just bite the dust like everyone else, or end up getting a regular ol' visit from fate like everyone else, then it's clear the LORD didn't send me. Like, if they face the same end as anyone else, this whole thing is not divine or anything. #justsaying #keepitreal"
Numbers,16,30,"But if the LORD does something totally new and the earth straight up opens its mouth to swallow them and everything they own, and they disappear into the abyss in a flash, then you'll finally get it that these dudes seriously ticked off the LORD. Just sayin', it's a whole new level of divine wrath."
Numbers,16,31,"And then, like, as soon as he finished saying all that stuff, the freaking ground just split open right below them, you know?"
Numbers,16,32,"And like, the earth just like, opened up and, you know, swallowed them and all their houses, and like, everyone who was with Korah, like, all their stuff too."
Numbers,16,33,"Like, they and everything they had, straight up went down into the pit, and then the earth closed over them and they were totally wiped out from the whole group."
Numbers,16,34,"And all the people of Israel who were nearby ran away when they heard them shouting, because they were afraid the ground would swallow them too."
Numbers,16,35,"Dude, like, the LORD totally set off this wild fire that totally wiped out those 250 dudes who were all into offering incense and stuff."
Numbers,16,36,"So, like, God had a chat with Moses and was all like,"
Numbers,16,37,"Yo, tell Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, to grab the censers from the fire and toss that fire over there. It's all sacred and stuff."
Numbers,16,38,"Those who messed up big time should take those censers, the ones they used to mess up, and turn them into these cool plates to cover the altar. Since they used those censers in front of the LORD, they're now all special and holy. It'll be like a reminder to the children of Israel of what went down."
Numbers,16,39,"So Eleazar, the priest, grabbed those cool bronze censers that were used to burn offerings, and they were repurposed into these sick, wide plates to cover the altar:"
Numbers,16,40,"This is a reminder for all the Israelites that only descendants of Aaron can offer incense to the LORD. Nobody else should try to do it, or they'll end up like Korah and his crew, just as the LORD warned through Moses."
Numbers,16,41,"But the next day, the whole crew of Israel's squad started throwing shade at Moses and Aaron, like, 'Yo, you straight up killed the LORD's peeps.'"
Numbers,16,42,"So, like, everyone got together and they were all, like, mad at Moses and Aaron. And then they started looking at the tabernacle, and guess what? There was this big cloud that totally covered it, and then boom! The glory of the LORD was there for everyone to see."
Numbers,16,43,So Moses and Aaron pulled up to the meeting spot outside the big tent.
Numbers,16,44,"And God was like, 'YO, Moses! Listen up!'"
Numbers,16,45,"Yo, bounce out from this crew so I can totally wipe 'em out in a sec. And they straight up hit the ground, face down."
Numbers,16,46,"Yo, Aaron! Grab a censer, take some fire from the altar, toss in some incense, and hustle over to the crew. They need some serious soul-cleansing ASAP. The Lord's pretty ticked off right now, and it's already starting to get messy with the plague."
Numbers,16,47,So Aaron did what Moses told him to do and quickly went into the middle of the crowd. And guess what? The plague had already started affecting the people. But Aaron didn't waste any time – he lit some incense and made things right by seeking forgiveness for the people.
Numbers,16,48,"And he like, totally stepped up, bruh, right in the middle of the casualties and the survivors, and BOOM, the plague just stopped dead in its tracks. No more chaos, man."
Numbers,16,49,"So, like, there were a total of 14,700 peeps who sadly lost their lives due to the plague. And that's not even counting the ones who died because of what went down with Korah."
Numbers,16,50,"So Aaron went back to Moses at the entrance of the gathering place, and the plague stopped."
Numbers,17,1,"Yo, the Big Man upstairs gave Moses the lowdown, he was like,"
Numbers,17,2,"Yo, guys and gals of Israel, listen up! So, grab a rod from each one of y'all, like your pops or grandpops, doesn't matter, just make sure it's from your fam tree. And here's the deal, we need twelve rods, one from each prince in the fam. Oh, and don't forget to write your name on your rod, alrighty?"
Numbers,17,3,And you gotta scribble Aaron's name on the Levi's rod: 'cause one rod is gonna represent the big boss of their family house.
Numbers,17,4,"And like, you gotta store them in the tabernacle of the congregation, right in front of the testimony, where I'm gonna meet up with you."
Numbers,17,5,"So, like, here's the deal, the chosen dude's stick is totally gonna bloom, and I'll shut down all the whining from the Israelites who keep complaining about you."
Numbers,17,6,"So Moses talked to the kids of Israel, and every prince gave him a cool stick, one for each prince, based on their fam's crib. There were like twelve sticks in total, and Aaron's stick was part of the bunch. (just like, one stick per prince, ya know)"
Numbers,17,7,So Moses put the rods in front of the LORD in the chill tabernacle.
Numbers,17,8,"So the next day, Moses went into the tabernacle of witness, and guess what? Aaron's rod for the house of Levi had sprouted, with buds, blossoms, and even almonds growing on it!"
Numbers,17,9,"So Moses got all the rods and showed them to the Israelites, and they checked them out and each person took their own rod."
Numbers,17,10,"So, God told Moses to bring Aaron's staff back and put it in front of the sacred chest as a reminder for those who rebel against Him. This will help put an end to all their complaining and prevent any more deaths."
Numbers,17,11,"So Moses did it, exactly as the LORD told him to."
Numbers,17,12,"So the Israelites were like, 'Yo, Moses, listen up! We're literally gonna die, like, we're totally doomed, straight up.'"
Numbers,17,13,"Like, anyone who gets too close to the LORD's pad is toast! Are we seriously gonna get smoked?"
Numbers,18,1,"Yo, Aaron, listen up. You and your homies, along with your pops and fam, gotta take responsibility for all the wrong stuff that goes down in the sanctuary. And don't forget, you and your crew are accountable for any mistakes made in your priest game."
Numbers,18,2,"And, like, make sure you bring your bros from the tribe of Levi, which is like your dad's tribe, so they can, like, join you and serve you. But you and your squad, you'll be the ones serving in front of the tabernacle, yo."
Numbers,18,3,"And they gotta stay on top of all your responsibilities, making sure everything in the tabernacle is in order. Just remember, they can't go near the sacred stuff and the altar, otherwise they, and even you, might end up bite the dust."
Numbers,18,4,"And they're gonna be on your squad, keeping the tabernacle game strong, taking care of all the tabernacle duties. And no random person gonna be getting close to y'all, for real."
Numbers,18,5,"And you gotta make sure you look after the sanctuary and the altar, so there's no more anger vibes directed towards the kids of Israel."
Numbers,18,6,"Yo, check it out, I've got your bros, the Levites, taken 'em from the Israelite squad. They're a straight-up gift for the LORD, assigned to handle the duties at the tabernacle."
Numbers,18,7,"So, like, you and your homies gotta be responsible for doing all the priestly stuff at the altar and behind the curtain. It's your job, ya know? Consider it a special gift, bro. Oh, and if some random person tries to do your job, they'll face the ultimate consequence."
Numbers,18,8,"Yo, Aaron, listen up. I'm hooking you up with the responsibility of handling all the sacred offerings from the peeps of Israel. I'm giving them to you and your squad because of the special anointing, and it's gonna be a forever thing."
Numbers,18,9,"These are the legit sacred stuff that can't be burned: all their offerings, food offerings, sin offerings, and trespass offerings that they give to me are like super holy for you and your squad."
Numbers,18,10,"You gotta chow down on this holy food in the holiest hangout spot. All the bros gotta eat it, no exceptions. This grub is sacred for you, no joking around."
Numbers,18,11,"So, this is yours, like a cool gift from the Israelites, all these awesome offerings that they're waving around. I've totally given them to you, your kids, and even your daughters—forever! Oh, and just to be clear, anyone who's chill and pure in your fam can have a feast with it."
Numbers,18,12,"I've hooked you up with the top-notch oil, the premium wine, and the freshest wheat—the cream of the crop that they'll be offering to the LORD."
Numbers,18,13,"Like, whatever is the first and best from the land, that you bring to the LORD, is totally yours. All the cool people in your house can totally chow down on it."
Numbers,18,14,You totally get to keep anything dedicated in Israel.
Numbers,18,15,"Yo, anything that comes out first from humans or animals, like babies and stuff, that the people bring to the LORD, it's all gonna be yours. But wait, you gotta make sure to redeem the firstborn of humans and the firstling of unclean animals, gotta save 'em or buy 'em back, you know?"
Numbers,18,16,"And anyone who needs to be redeemed from the age of one month onward, you should redeem them by paying five shekels, based on your estimate, using the value of the sanctuary shekel, which is twenty gerahs."
Numbers,18,17,"But yo, don't even think about cashing in on a firstborn cow, sheep, or goat, cuz they're sacred, you feel? Gotta sprinkle their blood on the altar, and burn up their fat as a fire offering that smells hella good to the LORD."
Numbers,18,18,"You can totally have their flesh, like it's yours, just like you own the wave breast and the right shoulder."
Numbers,18,19,"Yo, all the dope offerings that the Israelites give to the LORD, I've given to you and your squad sonss and daughters included), forever and ever. It's like a legit salty covenant before the LORD, for you and your fam, and for generations to come. No cap."
Numbers,18,20,"And God said to Aaron, Dude, you won't get any land or be a part of their stuff. But guess what? I am your squad and your ultimate inheritance among the peeps of Israel."
Numbers,18,21,"Yo, check it out, I've hooked up the Levi tribe with a solid 10% of all the stuff in Israel as their rightful share for the work they put in, specifically for all the tasks they handle in running the tabernacle where everyone gathers."
Numbers,18,22,"Yo, Israel fam, y'all can't be going near the tabernacle anymore, unless you wanna carry sin on your shoulders and end up dead. Like, seriously, dead. (And I mean dead, dead, no cap)."
Numbers,18,23,"Yo, the Levites are responsible for handling all the stuff related to the meeting place and they gotta take responsibility for any wrong they do. This rule is gonna be in place forever for all y'all future generations of Israelites, 'cause the Levites ain't gonna get any land inheritance like the others."
Numbers,18,24,"So, like, the Israelites do this thing called tithing, where they give a portion of their stuff as an offering to the LORD. And, instead of the Israelites keeping it for themselves, like an inheritance, I've given it to the Levites. So now, they won't have their own inheritance among the Israelites, you know?"
Numbers,18,25,"Yo, God came through for Moses and said,"
Numbers,18,26,"Yo, listen up Levites! When you're collecting tithes from the peeps of Israel, the ones I've set aside for you as your inheritance, make sure to give a portion of it as a special offering to the LORD. It's, like, one tenth of the whole tithe, ya feel me?"
Numbers,18,27,And you should totally count this awesome contribution of yours as if it were the sickest harvest from your farm or the raddest amount of juice from your winery.
Numbers,18,28,"So, like, you gotta give a sick offering to the LORD from all your tithes that you get from the Israel peeps. And then, make sure to give the LORD's offering to Aaron the priest, ya know?"
Numbers,18,29,"You gotta offer up all the awesome stuff you got as an offering to the Lord, like the best of the best. Make sure it’s super holy and separated from the rest. (The 'best' here means the super fatty parts!)"
Numbers,18,30,"So, here's what you gotta tell them: Once you've set aside the absolute best stuff, that's when it gets credited to the Levites as a boost to their income. It's like the bonus from the threshingfloor and the winepress. {best: Hebrew for 'fat'}"
Numbers,18,31,"So, like, you and your peeps can totally chow down on this food anywhere, like, wherever you want, in your crib and stuff. ‘Cause this is, like, your payday for being so dedicated to serving in the hangout spot known as the tabernacle."
Numbers,18,32,"And don't worry, you won't be sinning if you've set aside the best part of it. Also, make sure you don't mess with any sacred things that belong to the Israelites, unless you want to face some serious consequences."
Numbers,19,1,"So God talked to Moses and Aaron, like, legit said,"
Numbers,19,2,"Yo, here's the deal from the Big Guy upstairs: He's telling the Israelites to find a totally flawless, spotless, never-been-used-for-work red heifer. That's the law, fam, so spread the word!"
Numbers,19,3,"And you gotta hand her over to Eleazar the priest, so he can take her outta the camp and one of you should take her down right in front of him:"
Numbers,19,4,Then Eleazar the priest will take some of her blood and sprinkle it directly in front of the meeting tent seven times:
Numbers,19,5,"And someone will totally incinerate that heifer right in front of them; like, every inch of the skin, flesh, blood, and even the poop gotta go up in flames, no joke:"
Numbers,19,6,"Then the priest grabs some cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet and tosses them right into the fire with the heifer."
Numbers,19,7,"After that, the priest gotta wash his clothes, take a shower, then he can join the squad again, but he gonna be considered unclean until the evening."
Numbers,19,8,"And the person who burns her shall, like, clean their clothes with water and, like, wash their body with water, and they'll be like, um, unclean until the evening."
Numbers,19,9,"So, like, this dude who's pure, he's gotta collect the ashes of the cow and stash 'em outside the camp in a clean spot. It's gonna be saved for the whole Israelite crew as a way to purify themselves from sin, you know? It's like a special water that separates them from the bad stuff."
Numbers,19,10,"Whoever collects the ashes of the heifer gotta wash their clothes and stay unclean until evening. This rule goes for the peeps of Israel and even the strangers visiting them. It's gonna be a forever thing, yo."
Numbers,19,11,"Yo, if you come in contact with a dead body, you're gonna be unclean for a whole week. It's like a serious rule, ya know. Take note, fam! 🙅‍♂️💀"
Numbers,19,12,"So, like, he's gotta use it to cleanse himself on the third day, and if he skips that, then he won't be clean by the seventh day."
Numbers,19,13,"If anyone touches a dead body and doesn't cleanse themselves, they make the sacred place unholy in the eyes of the LORD. And that person will be kicked out of Israel because they didn't get sprinkled with the special water to purify themselves. So they're still unclean and covered in their impurity."
Numbers,19,14,"Yo, listen up! Here's the deal: if someone kicks the bucket in a tent, everyone who goes in or stays inside the tent will be considered unclean for a whole week."
Numbers,19,15,And any open container that doesn't have a lid on it is considered dirty.
Numbers,19,16,"If anyone touches a dead body, a bone, or a grave in the open fields, they will be considered unclean for a whole week."
Numbers,19,17,"And if someone is considered unclean, they should take some of the ashes from the burnt heifer used for purifying from sins, and add some fresh water to it in a container: the ashes are like dusty stuff and the water should be flowing and alive."
Numbers,19,18,"So, like, get someone who's got their act together and give them some hyssop. Then, they gotta dip it in water and sprinkle that stuff all over the tent, the things inside the tent, the people in the tent, and even anyone who came in contact with a bone, someone who was killed, a dead person, or a grave."
Numbers,19,19,"The hygienic person gotta sprinkle water on the not-so-hygienic person on the third day and the seventh day. On the seventh day, they gotta clean themselves up, wash their clothes, take a good bath, and be all fresh and clean by the evening."
Numbers,19,20,But anyone who is unclean and doesn't cleanse themselves will be excluded from the community. They've made the LORD's sacred place impure and haven't been purified with the cleansing water. They're dirty.
Numbers,19,21,"This rule is super important: anyone who sprays the special water has to wash their clothes, and anyone who touches the water is gonna be unclean until nighttime. Like, it's a forever thing, man."
Numbers,19,22,"Like, anything the unclean person touches is gonna be unclean, and anyone who touches it is gonna be unclean until evening."
Numbers,20,1,"So, all the Israelites, like, the whole crew, went to the desert of Zin in the beginning of the year. They set up camp in Kadesh, and unfortunately, Miriam passed away and was laid to rest there."
Numbers,20,2,"So, like, there was, like, zero water for everyone, and they all got super mad at Moses and Aaron."
Numbers,20,3,"The people totally went off on Moses, saying like, 'Dude, we wish we had kicked the bucket like our homies before the LORD!'"
Numbers,20,4,Why did you have to drag us and all our animals out into this deserted place to die?
Numbers,20,5,"Why did you even bring us out of Egypt, just to bring us to this terrible place? There's no food, no figs, no vines, no pomegranates, and not even any water to drink!"
Numbers,20,6,So Moses and Aaron bounced out of the crowd and headed to the entrance of the tabernacle where everyone was meeting up. They totally dropped to the ground on their faces—mind blown when they saw the epic presence of the LORD.
Numbers,20,7,"Yo, the big man upstairs talked to Moses, like,"
Numbers,20,8,"Yo, grab that rod and gather up the squad - you and your bro Aaron. Then, speak to the rock in front of everyone. And check it, the rock will straight up gush water, and you'll hook up the whole crew and their animals with a refreshing drink."
Numbers,20,9,So Moses grabbed the rod like God told him to.
Numbers,20,10,"So Moses and Aaron got everyone to meet up by this big rock, right? Then Moses is like, 'Listen up, you rebels. Do we have to seriously get water from this rock for you?'"
Numbers,20,11,"So, Moses raised his hand and, with his staff, struck the rock two times. And, like, a ton of water gushed out, and everyone in the crew drank, including their animals. Pretty epic, if you ask me."
Numbers,20,12,"So, like, God was talking to Moses and Aaron, and He was like, 'Yo, since you didn't have faith in Me and make Me holy in front of the Israelites, neither of you will be leading them to the land I promised.'"
Numbers,20,13,"This is the story of the time the Israelites had a huge argument with God at Meribah, and He showed His holiness through it. (Just so you know, Meribah means 'strife'.)"
Numbers,20,14,"So Moses DM'd some messengers to the king of Edom, and he was like, 'Yo, bro Israel here. You know all the craziness we've been through, right? Like, seriously, it's been a lot of drama.'"
Numbers,20,15,"So yeah, our ancestors totally migrated to Egypt and like, we've been chillin' there for, like, ages. But those Egyptians were like, total jerks and gave us a hard time, along with our ancestors, man:"
Numbers,20,16,"So, like, we were totally crying out to the LORD, and you won't believe it, but He actually heard us and sent an angel to rescue us from Egypt. And guess what?! Now we're chilling in Kadesh, which is this sick city right on the edge of our territory!"
Numbers,20,17,"Hey, can we please pass through your turf? Don't worry, we won't wander off into the fields or vineyards, nor will we take a sip from the wells. We'll stick to the main road, no detours to the right or left, until we're out of your territory."
Numbers,20,18,"And Edom said to him, like, 'No way, dude! You better not try to come through here, 'cause I'll straight up come at you with my sword.'"
Numbers,20,19,"Yo, the Israelites were like, 'We'll take the main road, fam. And if me and my animals need a sip of your water, don't worry, I'll pay up. I just want to pass through without causing any extra trouble, ya feel?"
Numbers,20,20,"He was like, 'No way, you're not coming through.' But then, Edom straight up rolled up on him with a whole squad and some serious power."
Numbers,20,21,"So Edom straight up rejected giving Israel a detour through their turf, causing Israel to bounce and go another way."
Numbers,20,22,"So, like, all the Israelite peeps, including the whole squad, bounced from Kadesh and arrived at this lit place called Mount Hor."
Numbers,20,23,"Yo, the LORD straight up talked to Moses and Aaron on mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, like yo, He was saying,"
Numbers,20,24,"Aaron's gonna join his crew, 'cause he ain't gonna step foot in the land I hooked up for the Israelites. Y'all straight up defied my word at the water of Meribah. Word up."
Numbers,20,25,"Yo, grab Aaron and his boy Eleazar and take them up to mount Hor, okay?"
Numbers,20,26,Take away Aaron's clothes and put them on his son Eleazar. Aaron will join his ancestors and die there.
Numbers,20,27,So Moses did what the LORD said and they all went up to mount Hor with the entire crew watching.
Numbers,20,28,"So Moses took off Aaron's clothes and gave them to his son, Eleazar. Then Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain together."
Numbers,20,29,"And when everyone in the crew saw that Aaron had passed away, they were all bummed out for a whole month. Yeah, all of Israel was feeling it."
Numbers,21,1,"So, there was this Canaanite king named Arad living in the south. He got wind that the Israelites, who sent some spies in advance, were on their way. He decided to go all out and attack the Israelites, managing to capture a few of them as prisoners."
Numbers,21,2,"And Israel made a promise to the LORD, and was like, 'If you actually let me win against these people, I'll totally wipe out their cities.'"
Numbers,21,3,"So, like, God totally listened to Israel and gave them the victory over the Canaanites. They straight up wiped them out, along with all their cities. And they named the place Hormah, which basically means total destruction."
Numbers,21,4,"So, they left mount Hor, and they took the route by the Red Sea to go around the land of Edom. And let me tell you, the people were really bummed out, like, super discouraged because of the long and tiring journey."
Numbers,21,5,"And the people were like, totally dissing God and Moses, asking them why they took us out of Egypt just to let us die in this boring desert? Like, we don't even have bread or water, and this plain bread is, like, totally grossing us out."
Numbers,21,6,"So, like, the LORD was not happy with the people, and He sent these super gnarly fiery serpents to bite them. It was intense, man. Sadly, a lot of the Israelites ended up dying from those snake bites. :("
Numbers,21,7,"So the people went up to Moses and were like, 'Alright, we messed up. We talked smack about the LORD, and even about you! Can you please hit up the LORD and ask Him to get rid of these snakes?'. And Moses was like, 'Sure thing,' and he prayed to the LORD for the people."
Numbers,21,8,"And God was like, yo Moses, make a snake that's all lit up and put it on a stick. And here's the deal: anyone who got bit by a snake, if they look at that snake on the stick, they won't die and they'll keep on livin'."
Numbers,21,9,"So Moses whipped up this sick bronze snake and stuck it on a pole. And you won't believe it, but if anyone got bit by a snake, all they had to do was look at that bronze snake and they were good to go, alive and kickin'."
Numbers,21,10,So the Israelites moved on and set up camp in Oboth.
Numbers,21,11,"They moved on from Oboth and set up camp at Ijeabarim, in the desert before Moab, facing east towards the sunrise. (Ijeabarim means piles of Abarim.)"
Numbers,21,12,Then they moved on and set up camp in the Zared valley.
Numbers,21,13,"So they moved and set up camp across Arnon, which is in the wilderness on the outskirts of Amorite territory. Arnon marks the boundary between Moab and the Amorites, ya know?"
Numbers,21,14,"So, like, in this ancient book called 'The Wars of the LORD,' it tells us all about the epic stuff He did at the Red Sea and the brooks of Arnon. It's like, whoa, can you even imagine the power and awesomeness displayed there? Game-changer, dude! #MindBlown"
Numbers,21,15,"And at the river where the cool brooks flow, heading towards the chill vibes of Ar's spot, chilling right near the Moab's boundary. {leaneth: Basically rests, bro}"
Numbers,21,16,"And then they went to Beer: that's the well where the LORD spoke to Moses and said, 'Get everyone together and I'll hook them up with some water.'"
Numbers,21,17,"And Israel dropped this sick verse like, Yo, let that well flow; sing your heart out to it: {Flow up...: Hebrew. Ascend} {sing: or, respond}"
Numbers,21,18,"The royal squad started digging the well, alongside the cool crew of the people, guided by the lawgiver, armed with their sticks. And they kept moving from the wilderness to Mattanah:"
Numbers,21,19,"And like, from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and then from Nahaliel to Bamoth:"
Numbers,21,20,"And from this dope place called Bamoth in the valley, which is in Moab, all the way to the lit top of Pisgah, where you can peep the sick view towards Jeshimon. (btw Jeshimon means wilderness)"
Numbers,21,21,"So Israel hit up Sihon, the king of the Amorites, with a DM, like,"
Numbers,21,22,"Yo, can we slide through your turf? We won't trespass on your crops or vineyards, or even sip your well water. We'll just stick to the main road, roll until we're out of your territory."
Numbers,21,23,"So, like, Sihon was, like, totally not cool with letting Israel enter his turf. But, instead, Sihon got all his peeps together and straight up confronted Israel out in the middle of nowhere. They rolled up to Jahaz and started a full-on battle with Israel."
Numbers,21,24,"And Israel totally defeated him with their swords and took over his land from Arnon to Jabbok, right up to the Ammonites' territory, 'cause the Ammonites were no joke when it came to defending their border."
Numbers,21,25,"So Israel conquered all of these cities and settled in the land of the Amorites, including Heshbon and all its surrounding towns. {towns: in Hebrew, daughters}"
Numbers,21,26,"Yo, Heshbon used to be ruled by Sihon, the boss of the Amorites. He straight-up went head-to-head with the previous king of Moab and swooped in, taking all his land all the way to Arnon. No cap."
Numbers,21,27,"So, like, people who are all wise and stuff say, 'Hey, let's head to Heshbon and build up Sihon's city, you know, get it all ready and stuff.'"
Numbers,21,28,"Yo, there's straight-up fire coming outta Heshbon, like a lit flame from the city of Sihon. It's totally wrecked Ar of Moab and the big shots chillin' at the high places of Arnon."
Numbers,21,29,"Dang, Moab! You're in deep trouble, peeps of Chemosh: their sons and daughters got captured by Sihon, the Amorite king."
Numbers,21,30,"We straight up wrecked them, like Heshbon got totally destroyed to Dibon, and we totally trashed them all the way to Nophah and Medeba."
Numbers,21,31,So Israel was chilling in the Amorite's turf.
Numbers,21,32,"So Moses was like, 'Yo, let's check out Jaazer and see what's up.' And they totally took over the whole town, kicking out those Amorites who were chillin' there."
Numbers,21,33,"Then they took a detour through Bashan, and guess who showed up? Og, the king of Bashan, and his whole crew, ready to fight them at Edrei."
Numbers,21,34,"Yo, Moses, don't stress! I got your back. I'm handing this dude, his crew, and his turf over to you. Do to him what you did to that Sihon guy, the Amorite king who ruled in Heshbon."
Numbers,21,35,"So they totally wrecked him, his sons, and all his squad, until there was literally no one left alive. And then they straight up took over his land."
Numbers,22,1,"So the Israelites moved on and camped in the chill plains of Moab across the Jordan river, near Jericho."
Numbers,22,2,"So, like, Balak, this dude who is Zippor's son, he totally witnessed all the epic stuff that Israel pulled off against the Amorites, ya know."
Numbers,22,3,"Moab was freaking out, man, because the Israelites were like a huge crowd! It was giving them major anxiety and stress!"
Numbers,22,4,"So Moab goes to the older peeps of Midian and is like, 'Dude, these guys are gonna totally obliterate everything around us, just like when an ox chows down on grass in the field.' And Balak, Zippor's son, was rockin' the crown as the king of the Moabites back then."
Numbers,22,5,"So, he like totally hit up some messengers to get in touch with Balaam, you know, Beor's kid from Pethor, which BTW is by the river where his homies live. He wanted Balaam to come over 'cause he noticed this huge crowd of peeps who dipped from Egypt, and they're legit everywhere, like flooding the whole place. And they're camped right across from me, like right in my backyard! 😮"
Numbers,22,6,"Yo, hear me out, could you do me a solid and put a curse on these people? They're way too strong for me to handle. Maybe if we take them out, I'll have a chance at kicking them out of the land. I know that whoever you bless ends up blessed, and whoever you curse is, well, cursed."
Numbers,22,7,"So, like, the old guys from Moab and Midian, right? They went off with their divination stuff in hand, and they found Balaam, and started talking to him, delivering the message from Balak."
Numbers,22,8,"So he was like, 'Stay here for the night, and I’ll hit you up with the message that the LORD gives me.' And the Moabite leaders chilled out with Balaam."
Numbers,22,9,"And God approached Balaam and asked, Who are these dudes chillin' with you?"
Numbers,22,10,"So like Balaam was talking to God and he was all like, 'Dude, Balak, son of Zippor, the Moab king, sent me this message...'"
Numbers,22,11,"Yo, check it out, there's this nation that straight up left Egypt and they're everywhere, bro. You feel me? Anyway, try putting a curse on them and maybe I'll have a shot at beating them and kicking them out. Who knows, maybe I'll have the upper hand in this fight!"
Numbers,22,12,"And God was like, 'Balaam, sorry buddy, you can't roll with them. You gotta keep those curses to yourself because these people, they're totally blessed, ya know'."
Numbers,22,13,"So, like, Balaam woke up in the morning and he was all like, 'Hey, Balak's peeps, head back to your own turf because God's like, not giving me the green light to roll with y'all.'"
Numbers,22,14,"So the Moabite leaders decided to approach Balak and told him, 'Balaam won't roll with us, dude.'"
Numbers,22,15,So Balak decided to send even more important and respected princes this time.
Numbers,22,16,"So, like, Balak, Zippor's son, went to Balaam and was all like, 'Dude, nothing should, like, stop you from coming to me, okay? Don't let anything get in your way.'"
Numbers,22,17,"Yo, I'm about to hook you up with some major respect and do whatever you ask of me. So, do me a solid and drop a curse on these folks, please!"
Numbers,22,18,"And Balaam was like, yo, Balak's peeps, listen up. Even if Balak offered me a whole crib filled with mad stacks of cash and bling, I can't stray from what the LORD my God has said. I gotta stay true and not do anything more or less."
Numbers,22,19,"Hey guys, listen up! Can y'all just chill here with me tonight? I really wanna find out what God's gonna tell me next, you know?"
Numbers,22,20,"So, like, God showed up to Balaam in the middle of the night and was all like, 'Hey dude, if these guys come to get you, get up and go with them. But, just FYI, you gotta do exactly what I tell you when I say it.'"
Numbers,22,21,"So Balaam woke up bright and early, hopped on his ride, and rolled with the Moab crew."
Numbers,22,22,"And God was like, really upset because he went that way: and this angel from the LORD showed up as like, a total obstacle to stop him. And he was just riding on his donkey, with his two friends riding along too."
Numbers,22,23,"And the donkey saw the angel of the LORD blocking the path, with their sword drawn: and the donkey quickly veered off the road and ran into the field. So, Balaam hit the donkey to get her back on track."
Numbers,22,24,"But like, this angel, right? They were standing in the middle of a vineyard, with walls on both sides. Pretty epic, tbh."
Numbers,22,25,"And like, when the donkey spotted the LORD's angel, she totally freaked out and jammed herself against the wall, accidentally squishing Balaam's foot. And he, like, hit her in response."
Numbers,22,26,"Then the angel of the LORD went on and positioned himself in a super tight spot, where there was literally no way to escape or turn in any direction."
Numbers,22,27,"And when the donkey peeped the angel of the LORD, she totally tripped under Balaam: and Balaam got crazy mad, and he hit the donkey with a stick."
Numbers,22,28,"So, like, the LORD, right, makes the donkey talk, and she's like, 'Hey Balaam, what's up with hitting me three times? What did I do to deserve that?'"
Numbers,22,29,"And Balaam was like, 'Dude, seriously? You're totally making fun of me right now? Ugh, if only I had a sword, I'd totally want to smack you with it.'"
Numbers,22,30,"And the donkey was like, 'Dude, I've been your ride-or-die donkey since forever. Have I ever done you wrong like this before?' And Balaam was like, 'Nah, man.'"
Numbers,22,31,"So, like, God suddenly made Balaam see this angel dude, just standing there with a sword in hand. And Balaam totally freaked out, man! He immediately bowed down his head and fell flat on his face. It was intense, bro!"
Numbers,22,32,"Then the angel of the LORD was like, 'Dude, why did you hit your donkey three times? I came here to stop you because your path is totally messed up, you know, in a bad way.'"
Numbers,22,33,"And the donkey saw me and avoided me three times. If she hadn't avoided me, I would have definitely killed you but spared her."
Numbers,22,34,"Balaam admitted to the angel of the LORD, 'I messed up, I had no idea you were standing in my way. If it bothers you, I'll turn back.'"
Numbers,22,35,"And the angel of the LORD was like, 'Yo, Balaam, roll with the squad, but only say what I tell you to say.' So Balaam was down to hang with Balak's peeps."
Numbers,22,36,"And when Balak found out that Balaam had arrived, he went to meet him in a city of Moab, near the border of Arnon, which is in the farthest region."
Numbers,22,37,"Yo, Balak was like, 'Bro, didn't I like, seriously hit you up and ask you to come through? Why didn't you show up? I totally have the power to hook you up with mad respect and success, am I right?"
Numbers,22,38,"And Balaam was like, 'Hey Balak, I'm here now. Can I even say anything on my own? I'm just gonna speak the words that God puts in my mouth, you know.'"
Numbers,22,39,"So Balaam and Balak rolled up to Kirjathhuzoth. You know, the city with all those lit streets."
Numbers,22,40,"So Balak flexed with some lit oxen and sheep, and hit up Balaam and his squad of princes."
Numbers,22,41,"The next day, Balak brought Balaam to the top places where Baal was worshipped, so that he could get a view of the whole crowd."
Numbers,23,1,"So Balaam was like, 'Yo Balak, I need you to set up seven altars for me right here, and bring me seven oxen and seven rams.'"
Numbers,23,2,"So Balak did exactly what Balaam said, and both Balak and Balaam sacrificed a bull and a ram on each altar."
Numbers,23,3,"And Balaam was like, 'Yo Balak, hold up and do your burnt offering thing while I go up to this dope spot. Maybe God will come chill with me and show me some crazy stuff. And whatever He shows me, I'll come back and tell you all about it.' So, Balaam went up to a high place."
Numbers,23,4,"So, like, God bumps into Balaam and is all like, 'Yo dude, I've set up seven altars and sacrificed a bullock and a ram on each one.'"
Numbers,23,5,"And God gave Balaam a message to deliver to Balak, saying, 'Go back to Balak and speak these words.'"
Numbers,23,6,"Then he came back to him, and, behold, he found him standing next to his burnt offering, along with all the cool peeps from Moab."
Numbers,23,7,"So, he starts spewing his wisdom and says, you won't believe it, but this dude Balak, the Moab king, dragged me all the way from Aram, which is in the mountains out east. He straight up told me, 'Yo, go ahead and put a curse on Jacob and throw some serious shade at Israel.'"
Numbers,23,8,"Like, why would I even think about cursing someone that God hasn't cursed, or like, defying someone that the LORD hasn't defied?"
Numbers,23,9,"I spot him from the highest rocks and hills, you know? The people gonna live on their own, not getting counted with the other nations."
Numbers,23,10,"OMG, have you ever tried counting all the particles of dust on TikTok? It's like impossible! And don't even get me started on the huge number of influencers in Israel! Honestly, I low-key wish I could live my life like the righteous peeps and have a totally lit ending, just like them. #Goals"
Numbers,23,11,"And Balak was like, bruh, what did you just do to me? I brought you here to totally curse my enemies, and now you've straight up blessed them instead. Like, what's the deal?!"
Numbers,23,12,"And he's like, yo, should I not be careful about speaking the words that the LORD has placed in my mouth?"
Numbers,23,13,"So Balak was like, 'Hey, come along with me to this other spot where you can kinda see them from afar. You won't be able to see the whole crew, just a glimpse. And then, hit 'em up with a sick curse from there, ya know!'"
Numbers,23,14,"So he took him to the cool spot called Zophim, up on the Pisgah hill. And there, he set up seven altars and sacrificed a bull and a ram on each one. (By the way, Pisgah is just another name for the hill.)"
Numbers,23,15,"And he was like, yo Balak, just stay here by your burnt offering, while I go up and meet with the LORD over there."
Numbers,23,16,"So like, God came across Balaam and gave him a message, saying, 'Go back to Balak and tell him this, dude.'"
Numbers,23,17,"So, when he got there, he saw the dude next to his burnt offering and the Moab VIPs were there too. Balak was like, 'Yo, what did God say?'"
Numbers,23,18,"Yo, listen up Balak, I got a story to tell. Pay attention, Zippor's child."
Numbers,23,19,"God isn't like a person who lies or changes his mind. If he says something, he'll definitely do it. If he speaks, he'll definitely make it happen."
Numbers,23,20,"Yo, listen up! I just got this super cool command to bless someone, and guess what? They've been blessed, and I can't just undo it, like, impossible!"
Numbers,23,21,"God hasn't seen any wrongdoing in Jacob, and in Israel, there's no wickedness. The LORD, their God, is with them, and they've got the king's support booming through their ranks."
Numbers,23,22,God totally saved them from Egypt; he's like as powerful as a unicorn.
Numbers,23,23,"Ugh, like no magic can touch Jacob, and no one can predict what's gonna happen to Israel. People are gonna be like, 'OMG, look at what God did for Jacob and Israel!'"
Numbers,23,24,"Yo, check it out, the people gonna be like a boss lion, flexin' like a young lion. They won't chill until they feast on that prey and sip the blood of the defeated."
Numbers,23,25,"Balak was like, dude, don't even curse them, or bless them."
Numbers,23,26,"Yo, Balak! Didn't I already tell you that whatever the LORD says, I gotta do? Balaam out!"
Numbers,23,27,"So Balak was like, 'Hey, Balaam, come with me to a different spot. Maybe if we're there, God will be cool with you cursing this group for me.'"
Numbers,23,28,"And Balak took Balaam to the peak of Peor, with a view towards Jeshimon."
Numbers,23,29,"So Balaam was like, 'Hey Balak, let's flex with seven altars up in here! And don't forget to bring seven bullocks and seven rams, all set and ready!'"
Numbers,23,30,So Balak listened to Balaam and sacrificed a bullock and a ram on every single altar.
Numbers,24,1,"And when Balaam peeped that the LORD was down with blessing Israel, he didn't even bother trying to do his usual tricks and magic. Instead, he started heading straight for the wilderness. {to the meeting of: in other words, towards God}"
Numbers,24,2,"So, Balaam looked up and saw Israel chillin' in their tents, organized by their tribes. And then, the Spirit of God popped off and entered him."
Numbers,24,3,"So this guy named Balaam, son of Beor, had something to say. He was enlightened, enlightened enough to say this: 'yo, I used to be blind but now I see, and this is what I gotta share:'"
Numbers,24,4,"Yo, this dude heard God speak and had a vision from the Almighty. He was in a crazy trance, but his eyes were wide open, man!"
Numbers,24,5,"Dude, check out how awesome Jacob's tents are, and Israel's tabernacles are seriously rad!"
Numbers,24,6,"They're like those cool valleys, spreading out like lit gardens next to the river, planted by the LORD like trendy aloes and cedar trees chilling out by the waters."
Numbers,24,7,"He's gonna flex with his buckets of water, and his squad will be everywhere, and his king will be totally superior to Agag, and his kingdom is gonna be like, totally on another level."
Numbers,24,8,"God totally flexed on those haters by bringing him out of Egypt. Like, he's got the strength of a mythical unicorn and he's gonna totally demolish every nation that stands against him. He'll crush their bones and shoot them full of arrows, no mercy."
Numbers,24,9,"He totally went beast mode, chillin' and layin' down like a lion, a legit king of the jungle. Don't even think about tryna mess with him, 'cause you'll be cursed, but if you bless him, you're blessed AF."
Numbers,24,10,"Balak was so mad at Balaam, he clapped his hands together and straight up told him, 'Dude, I brought you here to curse my enemies, and now you've only been blessing them for the third time! Like, seriously?'}"
Numbers,24,11,"So like, you need to bounce and go back to where you came from: I totally wanted to hook you up with major clout, but dang, God decided to hold you back from the VIP status."
Numbers,24,12,"Balaam was like, 'Yo Balak, didn't I already tell your peeps you sent my way, like,'"
Numbers,24,13,"Yo, even if Balak hooked me up with a sick crib filled with stacks of cash, I can't go against what the Big Man upstairs says. I ain't got no say in doing good or bad on my own terms. I'm just gonna speak what the LORD tells me, no cap."
Numbers,24,14,"Yo, listen up! I'm about to bounce back to my peeps. So come through and I'll let you in on what's gonna go down between your people and mine in the future."
Numbers,24,15,"So, like, check it out. This dude Balaam, son of Beor, got some wise words to drop. He's like, this guy's eyes are wide open, and he got something to say:"
Numbers,24,16,"Yo, listen up! This dude heard God's words and had mad knowledge about the Most High. He even saw a vision from the Almighty while in a deep state, but with his eyes wide open."
Numbers,24,17,"I'll catch a glimpse of him, but not yet: I'll see him from afar, but not up close. A rad Star will emerge from Jacob, and a sovereign ruler will rise from Israel, striking the corners of Moab and taking down all the descendants of Sheth. {strike...: or, strike through the leaders of}"
Numbers,24,18,"And Edom will totally be owned, Seir will also be owned by their haters; and Israel will totally slay."
Numbers,24,19,"The one who's gonna be in charge, coming straight outta Jacob, is gonna wreck the remaining peeps in the city."
Numbers,24,20,"So, like, when he saw Amalek, he started speaking his mind and was like, 'Dude, Amalek used to think they were the top nation, but trust me, they're gonna bite the dust and go down for good.' (Just to clarify, he's talking about the nations that messed with Israel.)"
Numbers,24,21,"Yo, he peeped the Kenites and dropped some knowledge, saying, 'You're living it up in a solid crib, nesting in a rock.'"
Numbers,24,22,"But the Kenite tribe will face destruction, until Asshur takes you captive. (Kenite means Kain, btw.) How much longer until Asshur captures you?"
Numbers,24,23,"And he dropped some truth and was like, dang, who's gonna survive when God does His thing!"
Numbers,24,24,"And like, there will be these sick ships coming from the coast of Chittim, right? And they'll totally mess with Asshur and Eber, dude. Like, they'll seriously mess them up forever, man!"
Numbers,24,25,"So Balaam bounced and headed back home, while Balak took off too."
Numbers,25,1,"So Israel set up camp in Shittim, and the people started getting involved with the Moabite girls, you know..."
Numbers,25,2,"So, like, they invited everyone to, like, this big worship gathering for their gods, and all the people totally ate the sacrificial food and, like, totally worshipped their gods by bowing down. It was, like, a whole thing."
Numbers,25,3,"So Israel started vibing with Baalpeor, and God got real mad at them."
Numbers,25,4,"Yo, God was like, Mosess, gather up all the top dudes in the nation and set them up as a display before me, like right under the sun. Let's chill out my anger and protect Israel.'"
Numbers,25,5,So Moses told the judges of Israel to take down every single one of their guys who were getting involved with Baalpeor.
Numbers,25,6,"So listen up, this Israelite dude showed up with a Midianite girl right in front of Moses and all the people. And guess what? Everyone was crying their hearts out by the entrance of the sacred tent where they all gathered."
Numbers,25,7,"And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, peeped it, he straight up got up from the squad and grabbed a javelin, no cap;"
Numbers,25,8,"Then he followed the guy from Israel into the tent, and stabbed both of them. Yes, he struck the guy from Israel and pierced the woman's belly. As a result, the plague stopped spreading among the children of Israel."
Numbers,25,9,"So like, twenty-four thousand peeps totally bit the dust from that wicked plague."
Numbers,25,10,"Yo, God had a chat with Moses, like,"
Numbers,25,11,"Yo, this dude Phinehas, he's the son of Eleazar, who's the son of Aaron the priest, managed to calm me down when I was all angry at the Israelite peeps. He was super passionate about representing me, which saved the Israelite children from getting wiped out. I was usin' my jealousy to make a point but Phinehas shut that down real quick. #TeamPhinehas"
Numbers,25,12,"So, like, I'm telling you, yo, check it out! I'm totally sliding my covenant of peace his way, you feel me?"
Numbers,25,13,"And he's gonna get it, and his descendants too, the covenant for an everlasting priesthood, all because he was so hyped for his God and made things right for the children of Israel."
Numbers,25,14,"So, basically, there was this guy named Zimri, an Israelite. He got involved with this Midianite woman and, sadly, ended up getting killed. Zimri was actually the son of Salu, a high-ranking leader from one of the important families of the Simeonites. You know, like a big deal."
Numbers,25,15,"And the Midianitish chick that got killed was named Cozbi, the daughter of Zur. He was like the boss of a crew, the leader of a lit fam in Midian."
Numbers,25,16,"God slid into Moses' DMs like, 'Yo, listen up!'"
Numbers,25,17,"Mess with those Midianites, and totally crush them:"
Numbers,25,18,"They really messed with you using their tricks, they completely fooled you in the situation with Peor and Cozbi, who was a super important Midianite leader's daughter and also their sister. She got killed during the plague that happened because of what went down at Peor."
Numbers,26,1,"And like, after the whole plague thing, God was like, yo Moses and Eleazar (ya know, Aaron's son who's a priest), I got something to say."
Numbers,26,2,"Count all the peeps in the fam of the Israelites, starting from age 20 and up, from every fam's crib, everyone ready to throw down in battle for Israel."
Numbers,26,3,"So, Moses and Eleazar the priest were like talking to them in the chill plains of Moab by the Jordan River, you know, close to Jericho, and they were all like,"
Numbers,26,4,"Count all the people who are twenty years old or older, just like the LORD told Moses and the Israelites when they left Egypt."

Numbers,26,10,"LOL, like, the earth was like, 'OMG, open sesame!' and boop, it gobbled them up along with Korah and the rest of the peeps who bit the dust when a fiery blast consumed 250 dudes. TBH, it totally became a sign and stuff."

Numbers,26,52,"God talked to Moses, like,"
Numbers,26,53,"So like, the land will be split among them for keepsies, based on their number of names and stuff."
Numbers,26,54,"You gotta distribute more inheritance to a larger number of peeps, and give less inheritance to a smaller group: everyone gets their fair share based on the numbers. {multiply his inheritance: in Hebrew it means increase his inheritance} {diminish his inheritance: in Hebrew it means decrease his inheritance}"
Numbers,26,55,"But yo, the land gonna get split up by lottery, you know? Each tribe gonna score their inheritance based on their dad's lineage and all that."

Numbers,26,61,Nadab and Abihu totally bit the dust after they tried to pull off some sketchy fire moves in front of the LORD.
Numbers,26,62,"And the total number of them was twenty-three thousand, all males from one month old and older. They weren't included in the count of the children of Israel because they didn't receive any inheritance among them."
Numbers,26,63,"So like, Moses and Eleazar the priest were all on top of their game, counting all the cool kids of Israel on the chill plains of Moab by the Jordan river, right next to Jericho."
Numbers,26,64,"But none of these guys were counted by Moses and Aaron the priest, when they did a headcount of the kids of Israel in the desert of Sinai."
Numbers,26,65,"Because the LORD had said that they would totally bite the dust in the desert. And, FYI, not a single one of them made it out alive, except for Caleb, Jephunneh's offspring, and Joshua, who's the son of Nun."
Numbers,27,1,"Yo, listen up! So there were these dope girls, the daughters of Zelophehad, who's son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, from the fam of Manasseh, son of Joseph. And check out their names: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. They're pretty rad, huh?"
Numbers,27,2,"So they all gathered around Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders in front of the tent, and spoke up,"
Numbers,27,3,"Our dad passed away while we were trekking through the wild, and he wasn't part of the rebellious crew who opposed the LORD along with Korah. However, he ended up dying because of his own mistakes, and he didn't have any sons to continue his legacy."
Numbers,27,4,"Why should our father's name be lost just because he doesn't have a son? We want our fair share of our father's inheritance, like our brothers. Help us out!"
Numbers,27,5,And Moses brought their problem before the LORD.
Numbers,27,6,"So, like, God started talking to Moses, and He was like,"
Numbers,27,7,"The girls of Zelophehad are totally right: you gotta hook them up with their rightful share of their dad's inheritance, just like you would for any other dudes in the fam. Make sure their dad's property gets passed down to them, no doubt."
Numbers,27,8,"Yo, tell the Israelites this: if a dude kicks the bucket and doesn't have a son, his daughter should inherit the goods."
Numbers,27,9,"And if he doesn't have a daughter, then his bros will get his inheritance."
Numbers,27,10,"And if he doesn't have any siblings, then you should give his inheritance to his father's siblings."
Numbers,27,11,"And if his dad doesn't have any uncles, then you should give his inheritance to his relative who is closest to him in the family, and he'll totally own it. And this rule is super important for the Israelites to follow, 'cause the Big Man Upstairs, aka the LORD, told Moses it's the way to go."
Numbers,27,12,"Yo, Moses! Head up to Mount Abarim and peep the land that I've hooked up for the Israelite squad."
Numbers,27,13,"And once you've seen it, you'll also be reunited with your crew, just like how Aaron, your bro, was reunited."
Numbers,27,14,"You totally went against what I told you to do back in the desert of Zin when everyone was arguing, and I wanted to show off my holiness by miraculously providing water for you to drink. Yeah, that's the same water that caused all that drama at Meribah in Kadesh, right there in the middle of the wilderness of Zin."
Numbers,27,15,"So Moses was like, talking to God and he was like,"
Numbers,27,16,"Yo, let the LORD, the ultimate God of everyone's souls and bodies, appoint a dude to lead the whole assembly."
Numbers,27,17,"The one who goes ahead, the one who comes alongside, the one who guides, and the one who brings them to their destination; so that the crew of the LORD won't be lost like aimless sheep."
Numbers,27,18,"Yo, Moses, listen up. God told him to choose Joshua, son of Nun. This guy's got mad spirit and potential. So, Moses, put your hand on him, like, passing on the power."
Numbers,27,19,Show him to Eleazar the priest and everyone else; give him a task right in front of them all.
Numbers,27,20,"And you gonna give him a lil' bit of your swag, so that all the squad of the Israelite crew will know who's boss and stay obedient."
Numbers,27,21,"And he's gotta be there in front of Eleazar the priest, who's like gonna think hard and make decisions on behalf of him using the Urim, asking God what to do. They're gonna follow his instructions, going in and out, both him and all the kids of Israel, like the whole crew."
Numbers,27,22,"So, Moses, like, totally followed God's instructions: he grabbed Joshua and brought him in front of Eleazar the priest and the whole crew."
Numbers,27,23,"And he placed his hands on him and gave him instructions, just like the LORD commanded through Moses."
Numbers,28,1,"Yo, God talked to Moses and He was like,"
Numbers,28,2,"Tell the Israelites to give me their offerings and bread for my sacrifices. They should offer them to me at the right time, and it'll be a delightful offering that pleases me. It's like a chill scent for me to relax."
Numbers,28,3,"Yo, listen up! So, here's the deal: when it comes to offering fire sacrifices to the Lord, you gotta bring in two fresh lambs every single day. And these lambs gotta be in their prime, yo, no blemishes or defects. This ain't no one-time thing, it's a non-stop burnt offering, happening day after day. Gotta keep the fire burnin', if you catch my drift. Oh, and just to clarify, that dayy by day' part means it's gotta happen within a 24-hour period. Don't forget that, fam!"
Numbers,28,4,"You gotta sacrifice one lamb in the morning, and another lamb in the evening. Yeah, that's right! Don't forget, 'evening' means 'between the two evenings' - just so you know, fam!"
Numbers,28,5,"And like, you gotta use one-tenth of an ephah of flour for the offering, and mix it with like, a fourth of a hin of beaten oil."
Numbers,28,6,"It's like a consistent fully lit offering, set up back in Mount Sinai to give off a dope fragrance, a lit sacrifice made by fire for the LORD."
Numbers,28,7,"And for each lamb, pour a quarter of a hin of strong wine as a drink offering to the LORD in the sacred place."
Numbers,28,8,"And you gotta offer up the other lamb in the evening, just like you did in the morning, with that meat and drink offering as a lit sacrifice, pleasing unto the LORD."
Numbers,28,9,"On the Sabbath Day, you gotta bring two adorable lambs that are just one year old and perfect. Also, don't forget to bring two portions of flour mixed with oil as a food offering and its accompanying drink offering."

Numbers,29,14,"And for their food, it's gonna be a mix of flour and oil. You gotta make three-tenths of a deal of that mixture for each of the thirteen big ol' bullocks, and two-tenths of a deal for each of the two rams."
Numbers,29,15,"And like, each lamb gets this decent portion, like, a tenth or whatever, for all fourteen of them lambs:"
Numbers,29,16,"And one goat, like, for a sin offering, you know? In addition to the regular burnt offering, with its food offering and drink offering and stuff."
Numbers,29,17,"And for the second day, you gotta bring twelve lit young bullocks, two rams, and fourteen spotless lambs that are fresh on the scene, no cap:"
Numbers,29,18,"And the food they bring and the drinks they pour out for the young bulls, the rams, and the lambs should be based on how many there are, following the usual custom:"
Numbers,29,19,"And like, one goat, dude, for like, a sin offering, ya know? And we can't forget about the regular burnt offering, and the food offering, and the drink offerings that go with it, man."

Numbers,29,21,"And they gotta bring the food and drinks for the bulls, rams, and lambs, in the right amount for each one, like always:"
Numbers,29,22,"And one goat for a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering, its accompanying food offering, and its drink offering."
Numbers,29,23,"And on the fourth day, they offered ten bullocks, two rams, and fourteen flawless lambs that were one year old:"
Numbers,29,24,"Their food and drink offerings for the bullocks, rams, and lambs should be proportional to their number, following the usual procedure:"

Numbers,29,39,"Here's what you gotta do for the LORD during your special celebrations, in addition to your promises and voluntary contributions: bring Him your sacrifices, whether they're burnt offerings, food offerings, drink offerings, or peace offerings. It's all part of the deal, fam. #Blessed"
Numbers,29,40,"So Moses straight up told the Israelites exactly what the LORD told him to say, no cap."
Numbers,30,1,"So Moses gathered all the squad leaders of the tribes and dropped this message about the Israelite crew, like, 'Yo, listen up, this is what the big man upstairs, the LORD, ordered us to do.'"
Numbers,30,2,"If someone makes a promise to the LORD, or swears an oath to seriously commit themselves, they mustn't go back on their word, but instead should fulfill everything they said they would."
Numbers,30,3,"Like, if a girl makes a promise to the LORD and commits herself to it while still living with her parents, ya know, during her early days."
Numbers,30,4,"If her dad hears her promise and the commitment she's made to herself, and he doesn't object, then her promises will be honored and her commitments will be upheld."
Numbers,30,5,"But if her dad says no when he finds out, then none of the promises she made or the commitments she bound herself to will count: and the LORD will forgive her, because her dad said no."
Numbers,30,6,"And like, if she had a husband, you know, when she made a promise or said anything important, you know, that she really meant, she has to keep it, you know? Like, she can't break her promise and stuff."
Numbers,30,7,"When her husband found out about it, he didn't say anything on that day. So, her vows will still count and the commitments she made will still be binding on her."
Numbers,30,8,"But if her husband says no to her after he hears about it, then he must cancel the promise that she made and the words that she spoke to bind herself. The promise won't count for anything, and the Lord will forgive her."
Numbers,30,9,"But, like, any promise made by a widow or someone who's been divorced, you know, the vows they've made and stuff, will totally be like, still binding for them and stuff."
Numbers,30,10,"And, like, if she made a promise while living with her hubby or like, seriously swore an oath with her whole soul;"
Numbers,30,11,"And when her man heard about it, he stayed quiet and didn't object. So all the promises she made and all the commitments she made to herself will still be valid."
Numbers,30,12,"But if her husband totally cancels them the moment he hears them, then whatever she said about her promises or the commitments she made shall not count. Her husband has cancelled them, and the LORD will forgive her."
Numbers,30,13,"If someone makes a promise to bring suffering upon themselves or makes a serious commitment, their spouse has the power to honor or cancel it."
Numbers,30,14,"But if her husband stays silent and doesn't say anything to oppose her from day to day, then he agrees to uphold all her commitments and promises. He confirms them because he stayed quiet when he found out about them."
Numbers,30,15,"But if he cancels them in any way after hearing them, then he will be held responsible for her wrongdoing."
Numbers,30,16,"These are the rules that the LORD told Moses to follow, between a guy and his wife, and between a dad and his daughter who's still young and living at home."
Numbers,31,1,"So, like, God starts talking to Moses and He's all like,"
Numbers,31,2,"Make sure to get back at those Midianites for the Israelites, and once you're done, it'll be your time to join your crew."
Numbers,31,3,"So Moses addressed the crew, and he was like, 'Yo, get ready for battle! Pick out some soldiers and send them to face the Midianites. It's time to show the Midianites who's boss and get revenge for the LORD!"
Numbers,31,4,"You gotta send a thousand warriors from each tribe, representing all the tribes of Israel, to battle. Yep, that's right, a thousand from each tribe!"
Numbers,31,5,"So, like, each of the twelve tribes of Israel, they had, like, a thousand warriors, so in total there were twelve thousand warriors, ready to fight and stuff."
Numbers,31,6,"So Moses gathered up a thousand warriors from each tribe and sent them, along with Phinehas, son of Eleazar the priest, to fight. They were equipped with sacred weapons and had trumpets in their hands to sound the alarm."
Numbers,31,7,"So they went up against the Midianites, just like God told Moses to do, and they killed all the dudes."
Numbers,31,8,"And they totally wrecked the kings of Midian, along with the other dudes they took down: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian. Balaam, son of Beor, got sliced and diced with a sword too."
Numbers,31,9,"So, like, the Israelites totally captured all the women from Midian, along with their kids. Oh, and they also snatched up all their cows, sheep, and basically all their stuff."
Numbers,31,10,"And they totally torched all their cities where they lived, and all their swanky castles, with like, fire."
Numbers,31,11,"And they grabbed all the loot, all the swag, from both humans and animals."
Numbers,31,12,"So they brought the prisoners, the loot, and all the goodies to Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the whole crew of Israelites at the camp by the Moab plains, close to the Jordan River near Jericho."
Numbers,31,13,"So Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the cool leaders of the squad went out to meet them outside the camp."
Numbers,31,14,"And Moses got mad at the squad leaders, you know, the ones in charge of thousands and hundreds, who came back from the fight. (The fight, ya know, the war squad)"
Numbers,31,15,"Yo, Moses was like, did y'all keep all them women alive tho?"
Numbers,31,16,"Yo, check it out. These peeps, influenced by Balaam's advice, straight up disrespected the LORD by gettin' involved with some messed-up stuff at Peor. And lemme tell ya, a plague hit the whole crew of the LORD."
Numbers,31,17,"So, like, make sure to take out all the young dudes and any women who've, you know, been with a guy. Just sayin'. {him: Hebrew for a dude}"
Numbers,31,18,"But like, spare all the young women who haven't been with anyone, like, ya know, doin' the dirty deed. Keep 'em for yourselves, I guess."
Numbers,31,19,"So, like, you guys gotta stay outside the camp for a whole week. Anyone who's taken someone's life or touched a dead body, ya gotta cleanse yourselves and your prisoners on the third and seventh day."
Numbers,31,20,"Give everything you wear, all your animal skin items, anything made of goat hair, and all wooden objects a thorough cleaning."
Numbers,31,21,"Yo, listen up! Eleazar the priest was talking to the soldiers who were headed to battle. He was like, 'Yo, dudes! This is the deal - the law that the LORD told Moses to follow.'"
Numbers,31,22,"Like, only the sick gold, the lit silver, the dope brass, the hardcore iron, the rad tin, and the chill lead,"
Numbers,31,23,"Anything that can withstand fire should be passed through fire to make it clean, and then purified with water of separation. But anything that cannot withstand fire should be passed through water."
Numbers,31,24,"On the seventh day, don't forget to freshen up and throw those dirty clothes in the wash. Once you're clean, you can come back to the camp with confidence."
Numbers,31,25,"God like totally spoke to Moses, and He was all like,"
Numbers,31,26,"Yo, count all the stuff we took from our enemies, like people and animals, okay? You, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the community should do it together. Just saying, the people we captured are also included. No big deal."
Numbers,31,27,"And split the loot in two; between those who fought the war, who went out into battle, and among the whole group:"
Numbers,31,28,"So basically, let's give something special to the LORD from all the warriors who went out to battle. It should be like one out of every five hundred people, and also from the livestock like cows, donkeys, and sheep too!"
Numbers,31,29,Get some of their share and give it to Eleazar the priest as an offering to the LORD.
Numbers,31,30,"And out of the Israelites' half, you gotta take one part out of every fifty people, cows, donkeys, all sorts of animals, and give them to the Levites, who take care of the LORD's tabernacle. {goats: or, goats}"
Numbers,31,31,"So like, Moses and Eleazar, the priest, totally followed exactly what the LORD told Moses to do. They were on point, no questions asked."
Numbers,31,32,"And the loot, the leftovers from the stuff the soldiers took, was, like, a totally massive pile of six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep, yo!"
Numbers,31,33,"And 72,000 cows,"
Numbers,31,34,"And 61,000 donkeys,"
Numbers,31,35,And there were a total of thirty-two thousand women who were virgins and had not yet had sexual relations with a man.
Numbers,31,36,"The squad that went all out in battle had a whopping 307,500 sheep on their side. That's like a serious flex, man."
Numbers,31,37,The LORD received six hundred and seventy-five sheep as tribute.
Numbers,31,38,"There were like, 36K beefs, and the LORD's cut was like 72, you know, as tribute."
Numbers,31,39,"And there were 30,500 donkeys; of those, the LORD's share was sixty-one."
Numbers,31,40,"And there were like 16k people, and the Lord's cut was about 32 people."
Numbers,31,41,"So Moses gave the LORD'S tribute, the heave offering, to Eleazar the priest, just as the LORD had told Moses to do."
Numbers,31,42,"And of the Israelites' fam, which Moses split from the homies in battle,"
Numbers,31,43,"So, like, there were, like, 300k and 30k and 7.5k sheep for the congregation."
Numbers,31,44,"And 36,000 cows,"
Numbers,31,45,"And like, 30k donkeys and 500,"
Numbers,31,46,"And like, there were, like, sixteen thousand people, you know?;)"
Numbers,31,47,"Moses took a fraction (1/50) from the Israelites, including people and animals, and gave them to the Levites. The Levites were responsible for taking care of the tabernacle as the LORD commanded Moses."
Numbers,31,48,"So, like, the high-ranking officers in charge of like, thousands of people, you know, the leaders of the thousands and hundreds, they all came up to Moses, you feel me?"
Numbers,31,49,"So they were like, Mosess, just to let you know, we totally got a head count of all the dudes on our watch, and guess what? Not even one of them is missing. Not even a single dude, bro!'"
Numbers,31,50,"So, we're offering a gift to the LORD. It's like everything cool we've acquired, you know? Like fancy gold stuff, bling chains, bracelets, rings, earrings, and even those trendy tablets. It's our way of making things right with our souls before the LORD."
Numbers,31,51,"So Moses and Eleazar, the priest, collected all the cool gold and fancy jewelry from them."
Numbers,31,52,"And the total amount of gold they offered to the LORD, from the leaders of thousands and hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels. (Note: the offering here referred to as 'heave offering' in Hebrew)"
Numbers,31,53,"The soldiers were all about that loot life, each one snatching up some goodies for themselves."
Numbers,31,54,"So, Moses and Eleazar, the priest, collected the gold from the leaders of the thousands and the hundreds, and they brought it into the meeting place as a way to remember the Israelites in front of the LORD."
Numbers,32,1,"So, the peeps from Reuben and Gad had, like, a crazy ton of cattle, ya know? And when they checked out the land of Jazer and Gilead, they were stoked 'cause it was perfect for their cows and stuff."
Numbers,32,2,"The squad from Gad and Reuben slid into Moses' DMs, along with Eleazar the priest and the top dogs of the crew, and were like,"
Numbers,32,3,"Ayy, we got Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Shebam, Nebo, and Beon (which is also known as Bethnimrah, Shebam (or should I say Shibmah?), and Beon (also called Baalmeon)) in the house!"
Numbers,32,4,"Yo, God totally wrecked that place before the Israelites, but now it's like a chill spot for raising cattle and stuff. Your servants got mad livestock there, no cap. 😎"
Numbers,32,5,"So they were like, if we're, like, cool with you, can we, like, have this land as, like, our home? Please don't make us cross the Jordan River."
Numbers,32,6,"So Moses asked the kids from Gad and Reuben, like, are you just gonna chill here while your bros go to war? Like, what's up with that?"
Numbers,32,7,"Yo, why y'all tryna bring down the vibes of the Israel squad, making them second-guess going into the land that the LORD hooked them up with? Just let 'em live their best lives, fam!"
Numbers,32,8,"Yo, that's what your ancestors did when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to peep the land."
Numbers,32,9,"So, when they checked out the scene in the Eshcol Valley and scoped out the land, they totally killed the vibe for the Israelite crew. It made them lose all their confidence and they straight-up decided not to go into the land that the LORD hooked them up with."
Numbers,32,10,"And God got really mad in that moment and was like,"
Numbers,32,11,"No cap, all those guys who left Egypt and are twenty years old and older won't even get to peep the land that I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It's because they didn't stay loyal to me like they were supposed to, you feel me? Like, they couldn't fully back me up and do everything I asked. It's a straight-up disappointment, fam."
Numbers,32,12,"Yo, make sure you protect Caleb, son of Jephunneh, the Kenezite, and Joshua, son of Nun, 'cause they've been all in, faithfully following the LORD."
Numbers,32,13,"God got super mad at Israel, so he made them roam around the desert for like, forty whole years. It was punishment for all the people who did bad stuff in God's eyes, and they all eventually died out."
Numbers,32,14,"Yo, listen up fam, you're basically stepping into your dads' shoes and taking on their legacy as a bunch of sinful dudes. Like, you're totally intensifying the LORD's anger towards Israel. It's not a good look, y'know?"
Numbers,32,15,"If y'all ditch Him, He'll leave ya stranded in the middle of nowhere, and you'll end up wiping out the entire crew."
Numbers,32,16,"So they're like, 'Yo, let's get closer to this dude and tell him we wanna build sheepfolds for our cattle and cities for our homies! Like, we gotta take care of our animals and make sure our little ones have a place to chill, you know?"
Numbers,32,17,We'll totally be rocking our gear in front of the Israel squad until we help them get to their destination. And our younger squad will be chilling in the city walls 'cause of the peeps already there.
Numbers,32,18,We won't bounce back to our cribs until every Israelite has claimed their own territory.
Numbers,32,19,"So, like, we won't be getting our inheritance with them on the other side of the Jordan, you know? 'Cause our rightful stuff has been given to us on this side of the Jordan, on the east."
Numbers,32,20,"Then Moses was like, yo fam, if y'all are down to do this, and if y'all are ready to flex before the LORD in battle,"
Numbers,32,21,"And all of you will flex and cross over the Jordan River in front of the LORD, until he totally wipes out his enemies,"
Numbers,32,22,"And once you've conquered the land under the LORD's watch, you can totally chill and come back without any guilt in front of the LORD and the whole Israel crew. This land is gonna be yours, legit, in the eyes of the LORD."
Numbers,32,23,"But if you refuse to do that, yo, check it - you've straight up sinned against the LORD, and trust me, your sin is gonna catch up to you."
Numbers,32,24,"Make cities for your squad, and chill spots for your flocks; and stay true to your word."
Numbers,32,25,"So like, the peeps from Gad and Reuben were, like, talking to Moses and they were all, 'Yo Moses, listen up! We got your back, bro. Whatever you order, we'll totally make it happen.'"
Numbers,32,26,"Our squad, our babez, our pets, and all our swag, gonna be chillin' in the cities of Gilead:"
Numbers,32,27,"But we, your squad, will go ahead, fully equipped for the fight, in front of the LORD, ready to battle, just like you said, bro."
Numbers,32,28,"So Moses was like, 'Yo, Eleazar the priest, Joshua, and all the big shots leading the tribes of Israel, listen up.'"
Numbers,32,29,"And Moses was like, yo listen up! If the squad from Gad and Reuben are willing to roll with you across the Jordan, fully geared up for battle and ready to go before the LORD, and if we successfully conquer the land, then we gotta hook them up with the land of Gilead as their rightful property, no doubt about it:"
Numbers,32,30,"But, like, if they don't wanna join you on the epic quest all ready to fight, it's cool, they can still get their own crib in the land of Canaan."
Numbers,32,31,"And the kids of Gad and the kids of Reuben were like, 'Yo, we got you fam! Whatever the LORD said to us, we're totally gonna do it!'"
Numbers,32,32,"We're gonna flex our weapons and roll up in front of the LORD, ready to vibe in the land of Canaan, so we can fully claim our inheritance on this side of the Jordan."
Numbers,32,33,"So, Moses hooked up the children of Gad, the children of Reuben, and half of the tribe of Manasseh (you know, from Joseph's fam) with the kingdom of Sihon, the Amorite king, and the kingdom of Og, the king of Bashan. He gave them the land, along with all the dope cities in the area. Like, the whole package, man."
Numbers,32,34,"So like, the kids from Gad totally built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,"
Numbers,32,35,"And like, there were these places, you know, Atroth, Shophan, Jaazer, and Jogbehah. Oh, and Jaazer was also sometimes called Jazer, #justsaying."
Numbers,32,36,"So there were these cities called Bethnimrah and Bethharan, totally fortified and secure. They even had sheep pens and everything. Oh, by the way, Bethnimrah was also known as Nimrah. Pretty lit, right?"
Numbers,32,37,"So, like, the dudes from Reuben, they were all, like, building stuff in Heshbon, Elealeh, and Kirjathaim, you know?"
Numbers,32,38,"So, like, Nebo and Baalmeon, they, like, totally changed their names, you know? Oh, and Shibmah too, FYI! And they, like, came up with new names for all the cities they built. They were all like, 'Let's give these cities some fresh names!' Ya feel me?"
Numbers,32,39,"And the squad of Machir, the son of Manasseh, rolled up to Gilead, reclaimed it, and flexed on the Amorite squad that was chillin' there."
Numbers,32,40,"So Moses totally passed along Gilead to Machir, Manasseh's son, and let him have his own crib there like a boss."
Numbers,32,41,"So Jair, Manasseh's son, went and claimed those little towns and named them Havothjair."
Numbers,32,42,"So Nobah went and claimed Kenath and its surrounding villages, and he named it Nobah after himself."
Numbers,33,1,"So, basically, here's the deal: these are the epic adventures of the Israelite squad. They peaced out of Egypt, flexin' their powerful army, all thanks to the tag team effort of Moses and Aaron."
Numbers,33,2,"So Moses, like, totally wrote down all the places they went as they journeyed, 'cause the Lord told him to. And these, like, are the places they went to as they journeyed."
Numbers,33,3,"So, like, the Israelites left Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day; right after the passover, they bounced outta there with confidence, in front of all the Egyptians. It was epic!"
Numbers,33,4,"So, like, the Egyptians, right? They totally buried all their firstborns, because the LORD had like smitten them or whatever. And get this, the LORD straight up executed judgments on their gods too. Like, talk about some divine power moves, amirite?"
Numbers,33,5,"So, the Israelite squad bounced out of Rameses and set up camp in Succoth."
Numbers,33,6,"And they, like, left Succoth and set up camp in Etham, which is, like, right on the edge of the wilderness."
Numbers,33,7,"And they left Etham and went back to Pihahiroth, which is in front of Baalzephon, and set up camp before Migdol."
Numbers,33,8,"So they left Pihahiroth and crossed the big sea, all the way into the huge desert. They traveled for three days in the wild Etham, and finally set up camp in Marah."
Numbers,33,9,"And they left Marah and went to Elim: and in Elim there were twelve cool water spots, and seventy palm trees; and they set up camp there."
Numbers,33,10,"And they bounced from Elim, and set up camp by the Red sea."
Numbers,33,11,And they left the Red Sea and set up camp in the wildnerness of Sin.
Numbers,33,12,"And they like, totally left the desert of Sin, and set up camp in Dophkah."
Numbers,33,13,And they left Dophkah and set up camp in Alush.
Numbers,33,14,"So they left Alush and set up camp at Rephidim, but there was like, zero water for the people to drink. So not cool, dude."
Numbers,33,15,And they bounced from Rephidim and set up camp in the wild lands of Sinai.
Numbers,33,16,And they left the Sinai Desert and set up camp at Kibrothhattaavah. {Kibrothhattaavah means the burial grounds of desire}
Numbers,33,17,So they left Kibrothhattaavah and set up camp in Hazeroth.
Numbers,33,18,"And they bounced from Hazeroth, and set up camp in Rithmah."
Numbers,33,19,So they bounced from Rithmah and set up camp at Rimmonparez.
Numbers,33,20,"And they left Rimmonparez, and set up camp in Libnah."
Numbers,33,21,And they left Libnah and set up camp at Rissah.
Numbers,33,22,So they moved from Rissah and set up camp in Kehelathah.
Numbers,33,23,And they moved on from Kehelathah and set up camp at mount Shapher.
Numbers,33,24,"And they like, went away from this mountain Shapher, and like, set up camp in Haradah."
Numbers,33,25,So they left Haradah and set up camp in Makheloth.
Numbers,33,26,And they left Makheloth and set up camp at Tahath.
Numbers,33,27,And they left Tahath and set up camp at Tarah.
Numbers,33,28,"And they like, totally left Tarah and set up camp in Mithcah."
Numbers,33,29,And they like totally moved from Mithcah and set up camp in Hashmonah.
Numbers,33,30,And they bounced outta Hashmonah and set up camp at Moseroth.
Numbers,33,31,So they left Moseroth and set up camp in Benejaakan.

Numbers,33,35,So they bounced outta Ebronah and set up camp at Eziongaber.

Numbers,33,37,"So they left Kadesh and set up camp at Mount Hor, on the edge of the land of Edom."
Numbers,33,38,"So, like, Aaron, the priest dude, went up this mountain called Hor because the LORD told him to, and yeah, he died there. This happened in the fortieth year after the kids of Israel left Egypt, specifically on the first day of the fifth month. Sad stuff."
Numbers,33,39,"And Aaron was like, super old, he reached the age of 123 and then passed away on mount Hor."
Numbers,33,40,"Yo, King Arad the Canaanite, who was livin' it up down south in Canaan, caught wind of the Israelite kids on their way over."
Numbers,33,41,So they left mount Hor and set up camp in Zalmonah.

Numbers,33,49,"And they camped by the Jordan River, from Bethjesimoth all the way to Abelshittim in the plains of Moab. (Abelshittim means the plains of Shittim)"
Numbers,33,50,"So, like, God was talking to Moses, right? They were chillin' in the plains of Moab, near the Jordan River, ya know, close to Jericho. And this is what God said..."
Numbers,33,51,"Yo, listen up, Israel fam. When you've crossed over the Jordan and set foot in Canaan,"
Numbers,33,52,"So basically, you gotta kick out everyone living in that land before you and get rid of all their pics and melt-downs. And don't forget to totally tear down all those popular hangout spots they have."
Numbers,33,53,"And you gotta take over the land, make it your home, 'cause I've totally given it to you to chill out there."
Numbers,33,54,"So, like, here's the deal: you guys are gonna split up the land by drawing straws or whatever, and each family gets their own piece. The bigger families get more land, and the smaller families get less land. Each person's piece will be wherever their straw falls, based on their family tribe. Ye shall inherit, whether you get a lot or just a little, ya know?"
Numbers,33,55,"But like, if you don't kick all the people living in that land out totally, then it's gonna be a major pain in the butt for you. They're gonna bug you so much in the place you live, poking your eyes and poking you in the side. It won't be a chill situation."
Numbers,33,56,And guess what? I'm totally gonna treat you just like I planned to treat them.
Numbers,34,1,"God hit up Moses with a message like,"
Numbers,34,2,"Yo, listen up, Israel! So, when you finally reach the land of Canaan, which is like totally gonna be your inheritance and everything, make sure to take note of the whole shebang, like the complete package of Canaan and all its surroundings, you feel me?"
Numbers,34,3,"So, like, your southern area is gonna go from this super remote place called Zin all the way along the coast of Edom, and your southern border is gonna be like the very edge of the salt sea towards the east:"
Numbers,34,4,"And your territory will extend from the south until the Akrabbim hike, continuing through Zin. It will stretch all the way from the south to Kadeshbarnea, then move on to Hazaraddar and Azmon."
Numbers,34,5,"And the boundary will go all the way from Azmon to the river of Egypt, and it will end at the sea."
Numbers,34,6,"And for your west border, you'll have the lit Great Sea vibes. Straight flexin' by the water, that's your vibe fam."
Numbers,34,7,"And this is where you'll set your north boundary: starting from the huge ocean, go ahead and mark out Mount Hor for yourselves:"
Numbers,34,8,"Yo, head up from mount Hor and peep where your territory ends at the entrance of Hamath; the boundary is gonna stretch all the way to Zedad, fam:"
Numbers,34,9,"And, like, the border will totally extend to Ziphron, and, you know, it will like end at Hazarenan. That's gonna be your north border, dude."
Numbers,34,10,"So, like, you gotta mark off your eastern border starting from Hazarenan all the way to Shepham, like duh:"
Numbers,34,11,"And the boundary will stretch from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; it will go down and extend to the shore of the sea of Chinnereth towards the east: {shore of the sea: in their language, it means edge of the sea}"
Numbers,34,12,"And the boundary will extend to the Jordan River, and the outer limits will reach the Dead Sea: this will be your land and its surrounding area."
Numbers,34,13,"So Moses was like, 'Yo, listen up, Israelites. This is the land you're gonna get, all thanks to the big man upstairs. He said it's gonna be divided among nine and a half tribes, by drawing lots and stuff."
Numbers,34,14,"So, like, the fam of Reuben's kids, ya know, based on their family line, and the fam of Gad's kids, also based on their family line, they totally got their rightful shares of the inheritance, and even half of the Manasseh fam got theirs too."
Numbers,34,15,"The two tribes and the half tribe got their share on this side of Jordan, close to Jericho, towards the sunrise."
Numbers,34,16,"God was like, 'Yo Moses, listen up'"
Numbers,34,17,"Here are the dudes who will split up the land for you: Eleazar the priest and Joshua, Nun's son."
Numbers,34,18,And y'all gotta pick a leader from each tribe to split up the land for everyone to inherit.
Numbers,34,19,"These are the guys' names: From the crew of Judah, we got Caleb, Jephunneh's son."
Numbers,34,20,"And from the squad of the fam of the peeps of Simeon, Shemuel, Ammihud's kid."
Numbers,34,21,"From the tribe of Benjamin, there's Elidad, Chislon's child."
Numbers,34,22,"And the cool leader of the tribe of the squad of the children of Dan, Bukki, the son of Jogli."
Numbers,34,23,"Yo, Hanniel, son of Ephod, was the prince of the tribe of Manasseh, representing the children of Joseph."
Numbers,34,24,"And the leader of the squad from the crew of the Ephraim fam, Kemuel, son of Shiphtan."
Numbers,34,25,"And the leader of the squad representing the squad of the Zebulun squad, Elizaphan, the cool offspring of Parnach."
Numbers,34,26,"And the cool leader of the squad from the posse of the children of Issachar, Paltiel, the son of Azzan."
Numbers,34,27,"And the cool leader of the squad from the tribe of Asher was Ahihud, Shelomi's son, my dudes."
Numbers,34,28,"And the cool leader of the squad from the Naphtali fam, Pedahel (A.K.A. 'Pedro') - Ammihud's kid."
Numbers,34,29,These are the ones who God told to distribute the land of Canaan as inheritance to the people of Israel.
Numbers,35,1,"So God was like talking to Moses, right? They were chilling in this place called Moab near the Jordan River, close to Jericho. And here's what God had to say..."
Numbers,35,2,"Tell the Israelites to hook up the Levites with some real estate in their hood. They gotta get cities to chill in, and don't forget to toss in some chill suburbs surrounding those cities."
Numbers,35,3,"And they'll have cool cities to live in, with big open spaces for their cows, their stuff, and all their cool pets."
Numbers,35,4,"And the chill hangouts of the cities, which you gotta hook the Levites up with, should go from the city walls and spread out to about a thousand cubits in every direction."
Numbers,35,5,"Bruh, you gotta measure like two thousand cubits from each side of the city: east, south, west, and north. And the city itself will be right in the middle. That's gonna be like the suburbs for those cities, ya know?"
Numbers,35,6,"And you gotta give six cities to the Levites as safe havens for anyone who accidentally kills someone, so they can run there for protection. Plus, you gotta add another forty-two cities on top of that. It's like extra support, ya know?"
Numbers,35,7,"So, like, you gotta give a total of 48 cities to the Levites, ya know? And, um, make sure you include their suburbs too. Just keep it cool and give 'em what they need, alright?"
Numbers,35,8,"And you should totally hand over the cities to the cool kids of Israel, yo! Like, if they have a lot, give 'em a lot; but if they only got a few, just give 'em a few, man. Everyone needs to chip in and give some cities to the Levites based on the land they got, you dig? Like, it's their inheritance and all, dude!"
Numbers,35,9,"And God was like, 'Yo Moses, listen up,'"
Numbers,35,10,"Yo, Israel fam, listen up! Once you cross that Jordan River and step into Canaan, I got something to say to y'all."
Numbers,35,11,"So, like, you gotta choose some cities where peeps can run to if they accidentally take someone's life, you know? Like, if they didn't mean to do it or it was a mistake or something, they can escape there for safety. It's all about offering them a place to go when they didn't do it on purpose. #accidentshappen #safetyfirst"
Numbers,35,12,"So basically, these cities are like safe havens where someone who accidentally killed another person can go and not get punished right away. They gotta wait until they go to court and face the whole community before anything happens."
Numbers,35,13,"And, like, out of all these cities you're gonna hand over, you're totally gonna have like six chill cities where people can, like, feel safe, you know?"
Numbers,35,14,"You gotta hook it up with three cities on this side of Jordan, and three more in Canaan, which will be like safe havens, y'know."
Numbers,35,15,"So, like, there are gonna be six chill cities where the Israelites and even outsiders can escape to if they accidentally kill someone. It's a safe haven, you know?"
Numbers,35,16,"And if someone hits another person with an iron object and causes their death, they are a murderer. The murderer must be executed without fail."
Numbers,35,17,"And if he hits him with a rock and the person dies, he's a straight-up murderer. The murderer must without a doubt be executed."
Numbers,35,18,"But, like, if he, like, hits him with, like, a wooden weapon and the guy, you know, dies, then he's totally a murderer, dude. And, like, the punishment for murder is, like, death for sure."
Numbers,35,19,"The person seeking justice will personally take down the murderer: when they confront each other, the murderer will be taken down."
Numbers,35,20,"But if he deliberately attacks someone out of hatred, or plans to harm them and succeeds in causing their death;"
Numbers,35,21,"If someone intentionally hurts another person and causes their death, they deserve the same punishment. That's because they've committed murder, and the one seeking justice should also take their life when they have the chance to."
Numbers,35,22,"But if he accidentally attacks him, without any ill intent, or if he throws something at him without planning it in advance,"
Numbers,35,23,"Or, like, if you accidentally throw a stone at someone without realizing it and they die, even though you weren't trying to hurt them or anything, like they weren't your enemy and you didn't want to harm them or whatever:"
Numbers,35,24,"Yo, the squad gotta make a decision between the one who did the killing and the one who's out for blood, based on these rules:"
Numbers,35,25,"The crew gotta help the killer escape from the blood avenger and bring them back to their safe city where they were running to. They gotta stay there until the high priest, who got anointed with holy oil, kicks the bucket."
Numbers,35,26,"But yo, if the one who caused the death sitch comes out of the city of protection where they took refuge;"
Numbers,35,27,"If the person seeking revenge finds the one who committed the crime outside the safe zone of the city, and the avenger takes their life, the avenger will not be considered guilty of shedding blood."
Numbers,35,28,"Yo, like, he's gotta stay put in the city of his refuge until the high priest kicks the bucket. But once the high priest is gone, the killer can go back to his own turf."
Numbers,35,29,"So like, these rules are gonna be, like, forever and ever, for real, like a legit guideline for you and your crew, no matter where you live. No cap."
Numbers,35,30,"If anyone takes someone's life, the killer will be executed, as confirmed by multiple witnesses. However, a single witness won't be enough to bring about someone's death penalty."
Numbers,35,31,"And like, you totally can't be paying off a murderer, especially if they're like, totally guilty and deserve the death penalty. No way, man. They gotta face the consequence and be put to death for real."
Numbers,35,32,"And you can't bribe someone who has escaped to the city of refuge, to let them come back and live in the land, until the priest dies."
Numbers,35,33,"So, like, make sure you don't mess up the land you're living in, okay? 'Cause blood stains and contaminates the land, and there's no way to clean it up except by the blood of the one who caused the mess. You can't just make it go away, ya know?"
Numbers,35,34,"So, like, don't mess up the land you're gonna live in, where I chillax, because I, the LORD, hang out with the children of Israel."
Numbers,36,1,"So, like, the main dads of the clans from the crew of Gilead, who was Manasseh's grandson and from the Joseph fam, they approached Moses and the big shots, the top dads of the Israelites:"
Numbers,36,2,"So basically, they were like, God was all like to my dude, give the land to the Israelite kids by doing this whole lottery thing. And my dude, he was just following orders from God to give Zelophehad's daughters their rightful inheritance, you know?"
Numbers,36,3,"And if they marry someone from a different tribe of the Israelite people, their inheritance will be taken away from our ancestral inheritance and given to the tribe they belong to. This means their share will be removed from our portion of land."
Numbers,36,4,"And when it's time for the jubilee of the Israelites, their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe they belong to. This means that their inheritance will be transferred from the tribe of our ancestors, to the tribe they're joining."
Numbers,36,5,"So Moses was like, yo fam, listen up! This is what the LORD wants us to do. The tribe of Joseph's boys is speaking some real truths, man."
Numbers,36,6,"So, like, God's got some rules for the daughters of Zelophehad. He basically says, 'Hey, you can marry whoever you want, but make sure it's someone from your dad's tribe.' It's all about keeping it in the family, ya know?"
Numbers,36,7,The children of Israel can't just switch tribes like that. Each one has to stick to the tribe their ancestors were from and hold onto their inheritance. #FamilyLegacy
Numbers,36,8,"So, like, if a girl inherits land in one of the tribes of Israel, she's gotta marry someone from her dad's tribe. This way, everyone in Israel gets to keep the land that's been passed down to them from their ancestors, ya know?"
Numbers,36,9,"No switching of inheritances between tribes, okay? Each tribe of the Israelites gotta stick to their own stuff, got it?"
Numbers,36,10,"As the LORD told Moses, the daughters of Zelophehad did exactly what He said:"
Numbers,36,11,"So Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, who were Zelophehad's daughters, got married to their father's brothers' sons."
Numbers,36,12,"And they got hitched to the squads of the homies from the fam of Manasseh, Joseph's offspring. And their property stayed within the tribe of their dad's fam. Bruh, it was like a family thing, you feel me?"
Numbers,36,13,"So, like, these are the rules and stuff, that the LORD told Moses to give to the Israelites in those chill plains near Moab, close to the Jordan River, you know, like right by Jericho."
Deuteronomy,1,1,"Yo, listen up! Here are the words that Moses said to all the peeps of Israel while they were chillin' on this side of the Jordan River, in the middle of nowhere. They were in a plain across from the Red Sea, near Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab. (FYI, the Red Sea was also known as Zuph)"
Deuteronomy,1,2,It only takes eleven days to get from Horeb to Kadeshbarnea if you take the route through mount Seir.
Deuteronomy,1,3,"So, like, after 40 years, in the 11th month, on the first day, Moses was talking to the children of Israel, telling them everything that the LORD had commanded him to say."
Deuteronomy,1,4,"After he totally wrecked Sihon, the king of the Amorites, who was chilling in Heshbon, and also took down Og, the king of Bashan, who was posted up at Astaroth in Edrei:"
Deuteronomy,1,5,"Yo, across the Jordan River, in Moab, Moses started spittin' this law, like,"
Deuteronomy,1,6,"Yo, fam, check it. God hit us up at Horeb and was all like, 'Y'all been chillin' on this mountain for way too long, it's time to bounce.'"
Deuteronomy,1,7,"Yo, listen up! It's time to switch up your path and head to the Amorite mountain and all the nearby places – the plains, the hills, the valleys, down south, and even by the beach! We're talking about reaching the land of the Canaanites and going all the way to Lebanon, by the massive Euphrates River. Trust me, it's gonna be amazing!"
Deuteronomy,1,8,"Yo, listen up! Check it out, I'm hooking you up with this amazing opportunity. Go ahead and claim the land that the LORD promised to your OG dads, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It's all yours, and it's gonna be passed down to your future fam. Trust. {set: Heb. given}"
Deuteronomy,1,9,"So, like, back then I was all like, 'Yo, listen up! It's too much for me to handle y'all on my own, man! I need some backup!'"
Deuteronomy,1,10,"Yo, God has totally multiplied y'all, and guess what? You are lit af today, like a gazillion stars up in the sky."
Deuteronomy,1,11,"May the LORD God of your parents increase your numbers a thousandfold and shower you with blessings, just as He promised you!"
Deuteronomy,1,12,"Bruh, how am I supposed to handle all this heavy drama, stress, and conflicts by myself?"
Deuteronomy,1,13,"Yo, gather up all your intellectual squad, like the ones who are smart and respected among your peeps, and I'll elevate them to be your leaders. {Take: Hebrew word means Give, just FYI}"
Deuteronomy,1,14,"And you replied to me, saying, 'That's a cool thing for us to do.'"
Deuteronomy,1,15,"So I picked the top dogs from each of your squads - the smarty pants and the popular ones - and made them the big boss over you. They became leaders of thousands, leaders of hundreds, leaders of fifties, and leaders of tens. And I also appointed some cool peeps to help out in your crews."
Deuteronomy,1,16,"Yo, listen up! I gave a straight up message to your judges back then. I was like, 'Hey, y'all gotta hear out those disputes among your fellow brothers. And when you're judging, make sure you do it fair and square, no favoritism allowed. You gotta treat everyone equally, even the ones who ain't from around here."
Deuteronomy,1,17,"Don't favor anyone when making judgments; listen to both the little and the powerful. Don't fear anyone's opinion, because the judgment belongs to God. And if a case is too difficult for you, bring it to me, and I'll hear it out."
Deuteronomy,1,18,"And I was like, yo, I dropped some serious wisdom bombs and told you exactly what you need to do back then."
Deuteronomy,1,19,"So, like, when we left Horeb, we like totally journeyed through this massive and crazy wilderness, you know? It was like intense, man, just as the LORD our God told us. And then we finally made it to Kadeshbarnea."
Deuteronomy,1,20,"So, like, I was telling you guys, we've arrived at the Amorites' turf - the mountain that our awesome God is totally hooking us up with, you know?"
Deuteronomy,1,21,"Check it out, dude, the Almighty, your God, has given you this dope land. So, like, go and claim it as He promised your ancestors. Don't stress or let anything get you down, bro."
Deuteronomy,1,22,"So, you all came up to me and were like, 'Yo, we should totally send some people ahead of us to scope out the land and tell us the best way to go and which cities we should hit up.'"
Deuteronomy,1,23,"And I was totally down with the idea, so I picked twelve homies from y'all, one from each crew:"
Deuteronomy,1,24,"Then they like, totally hiked up the mountain and arrived at this sick valley called Eshcol, and like, totally explored it."
Deuteronomy,1,25,"So, they grabbed some of the yummy fruits they found, brought them back to us, and shared their thoughts by saying, 'Dude, this land that the LORD our God is hooking us up with is totally awesome!'"
Deuteronomy,1,26,"But y'all were like, nah we ain't going up, and straight up rebelled against God's command, man:"
Deuteronomy,1,27,"So, like, you guys were totally complaining in your cozy tents and were like, 'OMG, the LORD totally hates us! That's why He brought us out of Egypt, just to hand us over to those Amorites and ruin our lives!'"
Deuteronomy,1,28,"Where should we go? Our friends have made us feel down, saying that the people there are bigger and taller than us, the cities are huge and fortified all the way up to the sky, and we've even seen the sons of the Anakims there."
Deuteronomy,1,29,"I was like, don't even trip, no need to stress about those peeps. #NoFear"
Deuteronomy,1,30,"The big man upstairs, who's always one step ahead, will totally have your back and throw down for you, just like all the insane stuff he pulled off in Egypt, right in front of your eyes."
Deuteronomy,1,31,"And out in the wild, where you saw how the LORD your God looked after you like a father looks after his son, every step of the way until you reached this spot."
Deuteronomy,1,32,"But you totally didn't trust God, like, at all,"
Deuteronomy,1,33,"Yo, who went ahead of you to find a sick spot for you to set up your tents? They had your back with that fire at night to guide you and a boss cloud in the day to show you the way to go."
Deuteronomy,1,34,"And God was like, totally listening to what you said, and got super angry, and was all like, 'I solemnly declare now,'"
Deuteronomy,1,35,"Honestly, none of these dudes from this messed up generation will ever lay their eyes on the awesome land that I promised to give to your ancestors."
Deuteronomy,1,36,"Protect Caleb, son of Jephunneh, man! We'll hook him up with the land he's been exploring, along with his crew, all because he's been fully committed to rocking it for the LORD. #loyalty"
Deuteronomy,1,37,God was mad at me on your behalf and told me I can't go in there either.
Deuteronomy,1,38,"Yo, Joshua, son of Nun, is ready to take charge. He's stepping up to lead Israel and secure that land. Show him some love and support, 'cause he's gonna make sure Israel gets their rightful inheritance."
Deuteronomy,1,39,"And those kidz you thought would be like easy targets and your offspring who were clueless about right and wrong back then, they'll totally score that place and own it like a boss."
Deuteronomy,1,40,"Yo, listen up! It's time for you to make a move and head into the wilderness, following the path that leads to the Red Sea."
Deuteronomy,1,41,"So, we were like, 'Yeah, we messed up big time, and we're totally gonna fight now. Just like God told us to.' And we all geared up with our weapons, ready to head up the hill."
Deuteronomy,1,42,"God was like, 'Listen up fam, tell these peeps not to even think about going up there or trying to fight. I'm not rollin' with ya'll on this one. If you do, you best believe you're gonna get wrecked by your enemies.'"
Deuteronomy,1,43,"So I talked to you, but you guys totally ignored me and straight up disobeyed the LORD's command. You decided to be all fancy and go up the hill without thinking twice. Like, you were totally reckless!"
Deuteronomy,1,44,"The Amorites living up in the hills straight up attacked you, just like bees would, and straight up wrecked you in Seir, all the way to Hormah."
Deuteronomy,1,45,"And you came back and cried in front of the LORD, but the LORD didn't listen to you or pay attention."
Deuteronomy,1,46,"So you stayed in Kadesh for a long time, just as you had planned."
Deuteronomy,2,1,"So, we like totally turned around and started our journey into the wild, you know, like through the Red Sea, just like the LORD told me. And guess what? We like totally circled around mount Seir for, like, so many days!"
Deuteronomy,2,2,"So God was like, 'Yo, listen up fam,'"
Deuteronomy,2,3,"Okay guys, you've been circling around this mountain for ages, it's time to change direction and head north instead."
Deuteronomy,2,4,"Yo, tell everyone to listen up! Here's the deal: you're gonna pass through the turf of your homies, the descendants of Esau, who are chilling in Seir. And guess what? They're gonna be shook when they see you. So, make sure you keep yourselves in check, alright?"
Deuteronomy,2,5,"Don't even think of messing with them, I'm not gonna let you have any of their land, not even a tiny bit. That's 'cause I already gave mount Seir to Esau as his own property. Not a single step of that land is up for grabs."
Deuteronomy,2,6,"You can totally cop some food from them in exchange for cash, so you can chow down; and don't forget, you gotta splash some cash on that H2O too, so you can stay hydrated."
Deuteronomy,2,7,"Dude, like God has totally blessed you in everything you've done. He knows about your journey through this huge, wild place. For, like, forty whole years, God has totally been by your side. And, bro, you haven't even been lacking anything."
Deuteronomy,2,8,"So we were traveling and came across our bros- the kids of Esau- who were living in Seir. We took the route that went through the plain from Elath and Eziongaber, and then we turned and kept going through the Moab wilderness."
Deuteronomy,2,9,"Yo, chill, God was like, 'Don't mess with the Moabites and don't start any beef with them in battle, cuz I ain't giving you their land to claim as your own. See, I already promised that land to Lot's peeps over in Ar. So, just leave the Moabites alone, ya feel?'"
Deuteronomy,2,10,"Back in the day, the Emims lived there - they were a pretty awesome and massive group, just like the Anakims."
Deuteronomy,2,11,"There were some seriously huge dudes called giants, like the Anakims. But the Moabites had a different name for them - they called them Emims."
Deuteronomy,2,12,"The Horims used to be in Seir, but then the children of Esau took over after wiping them out. They settled in their place, just like Israel did in the land that the LORD gave them. {succeeded: which means inherited} {stead: or, room}"
Deuteronomy,2,13,"Alright fam, it's time to get moving and cross over the Zered river. So we crossed over the Zered river, you feel me? (brook: or, valley)"
Deuteronomy,2,14,"So, like, we were totally traveling from Kadeshbarnea to cross over this brook called Zered, and it took us a whole 38 years! Can you believe it? That's how long it took for all the men who were ready for battle to, like, disappear from our group, just as the LORD promised. By the way, the brook could also be a valley, ya know!"
Deuteronomy,2,15,"Like, the Lord, you know, totally had it out for them. He was all like, 'I'm gonna wipe them out from the whole crew until there was nothing left of 'em.'"
Deuteronomy,2,16,"And then, like, after all the dudes who were fighting got totally wiped out and like, died and stuff, from like, the entire population,"
Deuteronomy,2,17,"So, like, the LORD was talking to me and He said,"
Deuteronomy,2,18,"Yo, you gotta make your way through Ar and the coast of Moab today:"
Deuteronomy,2,19,"So like, when you get near the children of Ammon, don't mess with them or cause trouble. I ain't gonna let you have any of their land, 'cause I already promised it to the children of Lot as their own land."
Deuteronomy,2,20,"So there used to be this land full of super tall people, like giants. The Ammonites actually called them Zamzummims, or Zuzims for short."
Deuteronomy,2,21,"There were these super cool, big and numerous people known as the Anakims, but the LORD totally wiped them out to make way for another group who took their place and settled there instead:"
Deuteronomy,2,22,"Just like back in the day when God dealt with the peeps from Esau, who were chilling in Seir. He straight up wiped out the Horims, who were in their way. And then Esau's fam took over and settled there for good, up until now, fam."
Deuteronomy,2,23,"So like, the Avims who were living in Hazerim, all the way to Azzah, were totally wiped out by the Caphtorims, who came from Caphtor. They straight up took over their land and made it their own. No joke."
Deuteronomy,2,24,"Yo, get up and start moving, go cross over the Arnon River. Check it out, I'm giving you Sihon the Amorite, the king of Heshbon, and his land. It's time to take possession of it and engage in battle with him. Let the conquest begin!"
Deuteronomy,2,25,"Yo, today I'm gonna start spreading major fear and intimidation vibes about you to all the nations around the world. When they hear about you, they gonna straight up freak out and be filled with intense fear and anxiety because of you, no cap."
Deuteronomy,2,26,"So I DM'd some influencers from the middle of nowhere to chat up Sihon, the boss of Heshbon. I came in peace, yo, and dropped some chill words, like,"
Deuteronomy,2,27,"Yo, can I pass through your turf? I'm gonna stick to the main road, not veering left or right."
Deuteronomy,2,28,"Yo, hook me up with some food and water, I'll pay you. Just tryna pass through on my own two feet, no biggie."
Deuteronomy,2,29,"(Like how Esau's fam in Seir and the Moabites in Ar treated me,) until I cross the Jordan into the lit land the LORD our God's hooking us up with."
Deuteronomy,2,30,"But Sihon, the king of Heshbon, refused to let us go through his territory because the LORD your God made him stubborn and resistant, so that he could be defeated by you, as it is evident today."
Deuteronomy,2,31,"So, like, God was all like, 'Yo, listen up! I've already started handing over Sihon and his land to you. Get ready to take possession of it and make it yours.'"
Deuteronomy,2,32,"So, like, Sihon totally decided to come at us with his whole crew, ready to throw down in Jahaz."
Deuteronomy,2,33,"And, like, OMG, the LORD our God totally handed him over to us; and we totally owned him, his sons, and all his peeps."

Deuteronomy,2,35,"We only took the cattle as our prize, and the loot from the cities we conquered."

Deuteronomy,3,1,"So, we turned around and headed towards Bashan, and guess what? Og, the king of Bashan, along with his whole crew, came out to fight us at Edrei."
Deuteronomy,3,2,"So, God was like, don't be scared, I got you covered! I'll hand over this dude, his crew, and his whole land to you. Just do to him what you did to that Amorite king Sihon who lived in Heshbon, no biggie."
Deuteronomy,3,3,"So like, God totally made us defeat Og, the king of Bashan, and all his peeps. We, like, completely wrecked him until there was, like, no one left. Epic win!"

Deuteronomy,3,13,"So, like, the rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, you know, the kingdom of Og, I totally gave it to the half tribe of Manasseh. It's all in the region of Argob, along with all of Bashan, which they used to call the land of giants, or whatever."
Deuteronomy,3,14,"So like, Jair, Manasseh's boy, totally claimed the whole Argob region, right up to Geshuri and Maachathi. And get this, he named it Bashanhavothjair, after himself, and it's still called that to this day, fam!"

Deuteronomy,3,16,"I hooked up the Reubenites and the Gadites with some prime real estate - like, from Gilead all the way to the Arnon River, scoring them half the valley. Their turf extended even to the Jabbok River, which is basically the boundary of the Ammonite peeps."
Deuteronomy,3,17,"The flat land, the Jordan River, and the whole area around it, from Chinnereth all the way to the salty sea in the east, near Ashdothpisgah. (Ashdothpisgah can be called the springs of Pisgah or the hill.)"
Deuteronomy,3,18,"So, like, back in the day, I was like, 'Yo, check it! The big man upstairs, AKA God, is hooking you up with this prime land to conquer.

Deuteronomy,3,23,"And I was like, yo LORD, listen up,"
Deuteronomy,3,24,"Yo, God Almighty, you've straight-up started revealing your awesomeness to your servant here, showing off your straight fire power and skills. Like seriously, who else up in the heavens or down on earth can even come close to doing what you do and flexing your mad strength?"
Deuteronomy,3,25,"Yo, lemme check out the lit land on the other side of the Jordan River - that dope mountain and Lebanon."

Deuteronomy,4,4,But all of you who stayed loyal to the LORD your God are still living it up to this day.
Deuteronomy,4,5,"Listen up, fam! I've schooled you on all the rules and regulations just like the Big Man upstairs commanded me. So, when you're in the new hood and taking over, make sure to follow 'em, aight?"
Deuteronomy,4,6,"So, like, keep doing all these things, alright? 'Cause that's what makes you super smart and clever in the eyes of all the other countries. They'll hear about all these rules and regulations and be like, 'Wow, this nation is seriously wise and understanding.'"
Deuteronomy,4,7,"Which nation can flex so hard, with God so close, like our lit AF God who's always there when we slide into His DMs?"
Deuteronomy,4,8,"Yo, listen up fam! There ain't no nation out there as lit as us. Our laws and rules are straight fire, the most righteous of 'em all. I'm droppin' this knowledge on you today, no cap!"

Deuteronomy,4,10,"Remember that day you were in Horeb, standing before the LORD your God? He told me to gather everyone so they could hear His words. It was all about learning to respect and honor Him every day of our lives on this earth, and passing that knowledge down to future generations."
Deuteronomy,4,11,"You all got close and stood at the base of the mountain. The mountain was literally on fire, reaching up to the sky, and it was surrounded by darkness, clouds, and super thick fog."
Deuteronomy,4,12,"So, like, God totally talked to you from the fire, dude. You heard the words loud and clear but couldn't see any image, man. It was just all about the voice, ya know?"
Deuteronomy,4,13,"So basically, God was like, 'Yo, listen up! I'm about to drop some major truth on you. Check it, I got these ten commandments that I want you to follow. They're so important, I even wrote them down on these two stone tablets.'"
Deuteronomy,4,14,"Yo, at that time, God was like, 'Listen up, peeps! I gotta teach you some rules and laws, so that when you reach the new land, you can follow them.'"
Deuteronomy,4,15,"So like, seriously, pay attention and be super aware of yourselves, okay? 'Cause, like, you didn't see any kind of image or anything when the LORD spoke to you in Horeb, right from the middle of the fire. It was, like, wild, man!"
Deuteronomy,4,16,"So you don't mess yourselves up, don't go making some statue that looks like anything, whether it's a dude or a chick."

Deuteronomy,4,19,"And like, don't go all star-struck when you look up at the sky and see the sun, the moon, and all the cool stars.

Deuteronomy,4,22,"Yo, I gotta kick it here and can't cross over the Jordan River, but y'all can go ahead and take over that lit land."
Deuteronomy,4,23,"Yo, listen up! Don't forget to keep your focus on what's important. Remember the agreement that the big man upstairs, the LORD your God, made with you. He strictly said no making fancy statues or replicas of anything. That's a big no-no from the big man."

Deuteronomy,4,26,"Listen up, fam! I've gotta drop some truth on you. Heaven and earth are my witnesses right now, and they've got my back.

Deuteronomy,9,18,"So, I totally hit the ground in front of the LORD, like I did before, for a whole forty days and nights.

Deuteronomy,9,26,"So, like, I hit up the LORD with a prayer and I'm all like, 'Yo, Lord GOD, don't even think about wiping out your peeps and the land that you rescued with your sick greatness. Remember how you flexed and led them out of Egypt with major power moves and stuff."
Deuteronomy,9,27,"Yo, don't forget about our homies Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Don't pay attention to how stubborn, wicked, or sinful these peeps are being right now, yo."
Deuteronomy,9,28,"So like, imagine if the place where you rescued us from starts saying, 'Dude, the LORD couldn't even bring those peeps into the land He promised them. He must've hated them, so He just brought them out here to totally kill them in the middle of nowhere.'"

Deuteronomy,10,3,"So, like, I crafted this super cool ark out of shittim wood, you know? Then, I carved two stone tablets that were, like, totally identical to the first ones. After that, I went up the mountain, holding the two tablets in my hand. Totally epic, right?"

Deuteronomy,14,7,"But like, you gotta stay away from animals that chew their food again and have split hooves, like camels, hares, and conies. They chew the cud, but don't have split hooves, so they're considered unclean for you, ya know?"
Deuteronomy,14,8,"So, like, the pig, it's not cool, because even though it looks all fancy with its divided hoof, it doesn't chew its cud, so it's like unclean and stuff. You're not supposed to eat its meat or even touch its dead body, bro."

Deuteronomy,15,9,"Watch out for any wicked thoughts in your heart, saying that the seventh year, the year of release, is coming soon.

Deuteronomy,19,4,"So here's the deal with someone who accidentally kills another person. They can go to a safe place and not get in trouble. It's important to note that this only applies if they had no previous beef with the person they killed, like it was a totally random thing. And by the way, when it says 'yesterday the third day', it basically means recently. Just clearing that up for ya!"
Deuteronomy,19,5,"Imagine this: two dudes head into the woods together to chop down some trees. One of them swings the axe, ready to cut down a tree, but whoops! The head of the axe slips off the handle and accidentally hits his buddy, causing him to die. In this case, the guy who swung the axe has to book it to one of those designated cities to seek refuge and stay alive. (By the way, 'head' in Hebrew means 'iron,' and 'helve' means 'wood,' and 'lighteth upon' means 'findeth'!)"
Deuteronomy,19,6,"Yo, imagine this: if someone accidentally kills another person, they better watch out because the deceased's family might come after them in a fit of anger and take revenge. It could be a long chase, and if they catch up, they might end up killing the accidental killer. However, if it can be proven that there was no pre-existing hatred between them, then the accidental killer shouldn't be put to death. Pretty wild, right?"
Deuteronomy,19,7,"So, like, I'm telling you, you gotta set up three cities just for yourself, okay?"
Deuteronomy,19,8,"And if the Lord, your God, expands your territory just like He promised your ancestors, and grants you all the land He promised to give them;"
Deuteronomy,19,9,"If you stay true to all these rules and actually follow them, which I'm telling you right now, like loving the LORD your God and always walking in His ways, then you'll get three extra cities, in addition to the ones you already have."

Deuteronomy,19,12,"So, like, the oldies from his town will, like, send someone to bring him back and hand him over to the avenger dude, like, so he can, like, meet his demise."
Deuteronomy,19,13,"You won't be empathetic towards them, but you gotta abolish the burden of innocent blood from Israel, so things will go smoothly for you."

Deuteronomy,19,17,"So like, these two dudes who are in a disagreement, they're gonna show up in front of God, the priests, and the judges who are around at that time, you know?"
Deuteronomy,19,18,"Yo, the judges gotta do a thorough investigation, like, they really gotta dig deep. And check it out, if the witness ends up being a total liar, spreading false accusations about his own bro..."
Deuteronomy,19,19,Treat him just like he planned to treat his bro: that's how you get rid of the negativity within your crew.
Deuteronomy,19,20,"And the people who are still around are gonna hear this and start freaking out, and they won't ever do anything so messed up again with you guys around."
Deuteronomy,19,21,"And don't have sympathy; it's all about fair play, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot."

Deuteronomy,20,2,"When you're getting ready for battle, the priest will come up to you and give you a pep talk,"
Deuteronomy,20,3,"Okay listen up, Israel! Today is the day we go into battle against our enemies, but don't let your hearts waver, don't be afraid or tremble, don't let them intimidate you!"
Deuteronomy,20,4,"Yo, check it: The LORD your God is straight up by your side, ready to throw down and take on your enemies, all for the purpose of saving you."
Deuteronomy,20,5,"And the guys in charge gotta talk to the peeps, saying, Yo, if there's a dude who just built himself a dope new crib but hasn't thrown down a dedication party for it, he can bounce and head back home. We don't want him getting wrecked in the battle while someone else hypes it up."
Deuteronomy,20,6,"Bro, imagine you're this guy who has planted a dope vineyard but hasn't even gotten a taste of its fruit yet. If that's you, you better go back home, like ASAP, before you end up dead in battle and some other dude just comes along and enjoys the fruits of your labor. No cap, you gotta protect what's yours, fam."
Deuteronomy,20,7,"Yo, imagine if a dude gets engaged to a girl but hasn't sealed the deal, y'know? So, if he's about to go to war and hasn't gotten busy with his girl yet, he should just bounce back home and avoid risking his life. 'Cause if he dies in battle, some other dude might swoop in and snatch her away."
Deuteronomy,20,8,"And the officials will address the people again, saying, if anyone out here is feeling scared or timid, it's totally cool for them to head back home, because we don't want anyone's spirits to drop, you know? We gotta keep the vibes strong for everyone!"
Deuteronomy,20,9,"Once the officers are done talking to the people, they'll appoint leaders for the armies to be in charge of everyone."

Deuteronomy,20,13,"And once the LORD your God basically hands it over to you, you gotta like totally attack and defeat every single guy there with your super sharp sword, no kidding:"
Deuteronomy,20,14,"Yo, listen up! When it comes to the ladies, the kiddos, the animals, and everything else in that city, you can totally keep it all for yourself. Yeah, that's right! You're allowed to feast on all the stuff you've taken from your enemies as a tasty reward from the LORD your God. #spoils"
Deuteronomy,20,15,"So this is what you gotta do to all those cities that are, like, super far away from you and aren't part of the same crew as these nations."

Deuteronomy,20,18,"So, like, don't follow their messed up actions, ya know? They've done all sorts of messed up stuff in the name of their gods. If you start doing the same, it's gonna be a major sin against the big man upstairs, the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,20,19,"Yo, when you're sieging a city for a hot minute, trying to conquer it, don't go chopping down the trees with some crazy axe. Those trees can be useful for food, man, so don't cut 'em down just for the sake of your siege. Remember, the trees in the field are like a person's life, they shouldn't be used for your battle tactics. So, don't be ignorant and go chopping them down."
Deuteronomy,20,20,Only destroy and cut down trees that you know are not for eating. Build walls against the city that is at war with you until it is defeated. (It will come down.)

Deuteronomy,21,3,"So, like, if a city is near to where a dude got killed, the older peeps from that city gotta bring a young cow that hasn't done any work or pulled any heavy stuff, ya know?"
Deuteronomy,21,4,"Yo, so the old folks from that city gotta take the cow down to this rugged valley, where no one's ever farmed or planted anything, and straight up chop its neck off right there in the valley, yo:"
Deuteronomy,21,5,"So, the Levite priests will step up, because God chose them to serve Him and give blessings in His name. They'll also be the ones to settle any disputes or issues."
Deuteronomy,21,6,"And all the older folks in that town, who live near the dead person, gotta do a hand cleanse over the cow that gets its head chopped off in the valley:"
Deuteronomy,21,7,"And they'll be like, yo, we didn't even do this, man. Like, our hands are clean, bro, we didn't spill this blood. And wait up, we never even saw this go down, swear."
Deuteronomy,21,8,"Yo, LORD, be chill and show mercy to your squad, Israel, ya know? You've totally saved them and stuff, so don't be blaming innocent blood on them. Forgive 'em and everything will be cool, ya dig? {in the midst, etc: in their midst}"
Deuteronomy,21,9,"By doing what's right and not shedding innocent blood, you'll rid yourself of guiltiness. It's all about pleasing the LORD, ya know?"
Deuteronomy,21,10,"When you're about to go into battle against your enemies, and God has given you victory and captured them,"

Deuteronomy,21,13,"And she'll take off her TikTok merch, and stay at your crib, and cry about her fam for a whole month. And then you can slide into her DMs, become her bae, and she'll be your wifey."

Deuteronomy,21,15,"If a dude's got two wives, one he's really into and the other he's not feeling so much, and they both have kids for him - the one he's into and the one he's not - and if the firstborn son is from the wife he's not so into..."
Deuteronomy,21,16,"So, like, when this person gives his sons their inheritance, he can't favor the son of his favorite wife over the son of his not-so-favorite wife, even if the less favorite son is the oldest."
Deuteronomy,21,17,"But, like, he's gotta, you know, legit recognize the son of the one he's not really feeling as much, like, as his firstborn. And, like, he's gotta hook him up with, like, double the goods and stuff, because, you know, the hater-son is, like, the one who gets the party started and, like, represents the strength and all. So, yeah, the right of the firstborn is totally his, you know, like, no question."
Deuteronomy,21,18,"Imagine if there's this dude who has, like, a seriously stubborn and rebellious son. This kid straight up refuses to listen to his dad or his mom. And get this, even when they try to discipline him, he still won't pay them any attention. Like, no way, bro."

Deuteronomy,21,20,"And they'll be like, yo, elders of his city, listen up. Our son here is all stubborn and rebellious, straight up refusing to listen to us. Dude's a total binge-eater and heavy drinker, no cap."
Deuteronomy,21,21,"Then all the guys from his city gotta like, throw stones at him until he dies, man. That's how you're gonna like, get rid of evil in your midst. And when all of Israel hears about it, they're gonna be like, super scared, I swear."
Deuteronomy,21,22,"And if a dude did something really messed up that deserves death, and he's gotta be executed, you should hang him on a tree, ya know:"
Deuteronomy,21,23,"Don't let his body hang on the tree overnight; make sure you bury him the same day. (Because someone who's hanged is considered cursed by God.) This is so your land, which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, doesn't get defiled."
Deuteronomy,22,1,"Don't pretend you didn't notice when your bro's ox or sheep wander off. Make sure you bring them back to him, no matter what."
Deuteronomy,22,2,"And if your bro isn't nearby or you don't know him, then you gotta bring it to your own crib, and it'll chill with you until your bro comes looking for it, and then you gotta give it back to him."

Deuteronomy,22,9,"Don't mix up the seeds when planting your vineyard, or else the produce from your seeds and your vineyard will be ruined."
Deuteronomy,22,10,Don't mix'n'match your power duo - an ox and a donkey on the same grind.
Deuteronomy,22,11,"Don't mix different fabrics in your outfit, like wool and linen."
Deuteronomy,22,12,"You should put fringes on all four corners of your clothes, which you use to cover yourself. (quarters: meaning wings in Hebrew)"
Deuteronomy,22,13,"If a dude gets a girl and they do the deed, but then ends up hating her,"
Deuteronomy,22,14,"And like, spread rumors about her and shame her by saying that I slept with her and she wasn't a virgin when I did:"
Deuteronomy,22,15,"So like, the girl's dad and mom will, you know, show the proof of her virginity to the leaders of the city at the hangout spot, ya feel?"
Deuteronomy,22,16,"So, like, the girl's dad will go to the elders and be like, 'Yo, I totally gave my daughter to this guy as his wife, but he's, like, totally hating on her, you know?'"
Deuteronomy,22,17,"And, like, he totally accused her and was all like, 'I didn't find your daughter a virgin, but look, here's proof of her purity.' And they have to show the cloth to the city elders, you know?"
Deuteronomy,22,18,"So, like, the leaders of that city gotta grab that dude and teach him a lesson in front of everyone;"
Deuteronomy,22,19,"They're gonna make him pay a hefty fine of a hundred silver coins and give them to the girl's dad, all because he spread nasty rumors about an innocent Israeli girl. And guess what? He's stuck being married to her forever. No divorces allowed, yo!"
Deuteronomy,22,20,But if this is legit and the signs of being a virgin aren't there for the girl:
Deuteronomy,22,21,"So they'll bring the girl to her dad's crib, and the dudes from her squad will throw rocks at her until she's out. She messed up big time by sleeping around in her own house, causing some major drama in Israel. That's how you get rid of the bad vibes, yo!"
Deuteronomy,22,22,"If a dude hooks up with a married chick, they both gotta go, like, both the guy and the girl. That's how you get rid of the bad stuff in Israel, man."
Deuteronomy,22,23,"Okay, so picture this: If a girl, who's like totally pure and hasn't even dated anyone yet, is engaged to this guy, and then another dude comes along and sleeps with her in the city..."
Deuteronomy,22,24,"So, like, you gotta take them both outside to the gate of the city and throw rocks at them until they die, ya know? The girl didn't cry out for help in the city and the guy, well, he messed around with his neighbor's wife. That's how you kick evil outta your community, bro."
Deuteronomy,22,25,"But yo, if a dude comes across a girl who's already promised to be someone's bae in the field and he straight up forces himself on her and does the deed, then that dude who did the dirt is the only one who's gonna face the ultimate consequence - death. (By 'force' they mean like strong hold, you know? Respect boundaries and consent, y'all.)"
Deuteronomy,22,26,"But you don't need to do anything to the girl; she hasn't done anything deserving of punishment. It's like when someone attacks their neighbor and kills them, it's a similar situation here:"
Deuteronomy,22,27,"So, like, he totally found her in the field, and the girl he was engaged to started freaking out and cried for help, but there was literally no one around to save her."
Deuteronomy,22,28,"If a dude finds a girl who's a total virgin and not engaged, and they hook up and someone catches them,"
Deuteronomy,22,29,"So, like, if a guy hooks up with this girl, he's gotta pay her dad fifty silver coins and then they gotta get married, ya feel? 'Cause he, like, deflowered her or whatever, so he can't just dump her later on. Gotta stick it out forever, man."
