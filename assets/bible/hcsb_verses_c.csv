1 Chronicles,29,25,The LORD highly exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been bestowed on any king over Israel before him.
1 Chronicles,29,26,David son of Jesse was king over all Israel.
1 Chronicles,29,27,The length of his reign over Israel was 40 years; he reigned in Hebron for seven years and in Jerusalem for 33.
1 Chronicles,29,28,"He died at a ripe old age, full of days, riches, and honor, and his son Solomon became king in his place."
1 Chronicles,29,29,"As for the events of King David’s reign, from beginning to end, note that they are written in the Events of Samuel the Seer, the Events of Nathan the Prophet, and the Events of Gad the Seer,"
1 Chronicles,29,30,"along with all his reign, his might, and the incidents that affected him and Israel and all the kingdoms of the surrounding lands."
2 Chronicles,1,1,Solomon son of David strengthened his hold on his kingdom. The LORD his God was with him and highly exalted him.
2 Chronicles,1,2,"Then Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to every leader in all Israel—the heads of the families."
2 Chronicles,1,3,"Solomon and the whole assembly with him went to the high place that was in Gibeon because God’s tent of meeting, which the LORD’s servant Moses had made in the wilderness, was there."
2 Chronicles,1,4,"Now David had brought the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place he had set up for it, because he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem,"
2 Chronicles,1,5,"but he put the bronze altar, which Bezalel son of Uri, son of Hur, had made, in front of the LORD’s tabernacle. Solomon and the assembly inquired of Him there."
2 Chronicles,1,6,"Solomon offered sacrifices there in the LORD’s presence on the bronze altar at the tent of meeting; he offered 1,000 burnt offerings on it."
2 Chronicles,1,7,That night God appeared to Solomon and said to him: “Ask. What should I give you?”
2 Chronicles,1,8,"And Solomon said to God: “You have shown great and faithful love to my father David, and You have made me king in his place."
2 Chronicles,1,9,"LORD God, let Your promise to my father David now come true. For You have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth."
2 Chronicles,1,10,"Now grant me wisdom and knowledge so that I may lead these people, for who can judge this great people of Yours?”"
2 Chronicles,1,11,"God said to Solomon, “Since this was in your heart, and you have not requested riches, wealth, or glory, or for the life of those who hate you, and you have not even requested long life, but you have requested for yourself wisdom and knowledge that you may judge My people over whom I have made you king,"
2 Chronicles,1,12,"wisdom and knowledge are given to you. I will also give you riches, wealth, and glory, unlike what was given to the kings who were before you, or will be given to those after you.”"
2 Chronicles,1,13,"So Solomon went to Jerusalem from the high place that was in Gibeon in front of the tent of meeting, and he reigned over Israel."
2 Chronicles,1,14,"Solomon accumulated 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, which he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,1,15,"The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar as abundant as sycamore in the Judean foothills."
2 Chronicles,1,16,Solomon’s horses came from Egypt and Kue. The king’s traders would get them from Kue at the going price.
2 Chronicles,1,17,"A chariot could be imported from Egypt for 15 pounds of silver and a horse for about four pounds. In the same way, they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of Aram through their agents."
2 Chronicles,2,1,"Solomon decided to build a temple for the name of Yahweh and a royal palace for himself,"
2 Chronicles,2,2,"so he assigned 70,000 men as porters, 80,000 men as stonecutters in the mountains, and 3,600 as supervisors over them."
2 Chronicles,2,3,Then Solomon sent word to King Hiram of Tyre: Do for me what you did for my father David. You sent him cedars to build him a house to live in.
2 Chronicles,2,4,"Now I am building a temple for the name of Yahweh my God in order to dedicate it to Him for burning fragrant incense before Him, for displaying the rows of the bread of the Presence continuously, and for sacrificing burnt offerings for the morning and the evening, the Sabbaths and the New Moons, and the appointed festivals of the LORD our God. This is ordained for Israel forever."
2 Chronicles,2,5,"The temple that I am building will be great, for our God is greater than any of the gods."
2 Chronicles,2,6,"But who is able to build a temple for Him, since even heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain Him? Who am I then that I should build a temple for Him except as a place to burn incense before Him?"
2 Chronicles,2,7,"Therefore, send me a craftsman who is skilled in engraving to work with gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and with purple, crimson, and blue yarn. He will work with the craftsmen who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, appointed by my father David."
2 Chronicles,2,8,"Also, send me cedar, cypress, and algum logs from Lebanon, for I know that your servants know how to cut the trees of Lebanon. Note that my servants will be with your servants"
2 Chronicles,2,9,to prepare logs for me in abundance because the temple I am building will be great and wonderful.
2 Chronicles,2,10,"I will give your servants, the woodcutters who cut the trees, 100,000 bushels of wheat flour, 100,000 bushels of barley, 110,000 gallons of wine, and 110,000 gallons of oil."
2 Chronicles,2,11,"Then King Hiram of Tyre wrote a letter and sent it to Solomon: Because the LORD loves His people, He set you over them as king."
2 Chronicles,2,12,"Hiram also said: May the LORD God of Israel, who made the heavens and the earth, be praised! He gave King David a wise son with insight and understanding, who will build a temple for the LORD and a royal palace for himself."
2 Chronicles,2,13,"I have now sent Huram-abi, a skillful man who has understanding."
2 Chronicles,2,14,"He is the son of a woman from the daughters of Dan. His father is a man of Tyre. He knows how to work with gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, with purple, blue, crimson yarn, and fine linen. He knows how to do all kinds of engraving and to execute any design that may be given him. I have sent him to be with your craftsmen and the craftsmen of my lord, your father David."
2 Chronicles,2,15,"Now, let my lord send the wheat, barley, oil, and wine to his servants as promised."
2 Chronicles,2,16,"We will cut logs from Lebanon, as many as you need, and bring them to you as rafts by sea to Joppa. You can then take them up to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,2,17,"Solomon took a census of all the foreign men in the land of Israel, after the census that his father David had conducted, and the total was 153,600."
2 Chronicles,2,18,"Solomon made 70,000 of them porters, 80,000 stonecutters in the mountains, and 3,600 supervisors to make the people work."
2 Chronicles,3,1,"Then Solomon began to build the LORD’s temple in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah where the LORD had appeared to his father David, at the site David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite."
2 Chronicles,3,2,He began to build on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign.
2 Chronicles,3,3,"These are Solomon’s foundations for building God’s temple: the length was 90 feet, and the width 30 feet."
2 Chronicles,3,4,"The portico, which was across the front extending across the width of the temple, was 30 feet wide; its height was 30 feet; he overlaid its inner surface with pure gold."
2 Chronicles,3,5,"The larger room he paneled with cypress wood, overlaid with fine gold, and decorated with palm trees and chains."
2 Chronicles,3,6,"He adorned the temple with precious stones for beauty, and the gold was the gold of Parvaim."
2 Chronicles,3,7,"He overlaid the temple—the beams, the thresholds, its walls and doors—with gold, and he carved cherubim on the walls."
2 Chronicles,3,8,"Then he made the most holy place; its length corresponded to the width of the temple, 30 feet, and its width was 30 feet. He overlaid it with 45,000 pounds of fine gold."
2 Chronicles,3,9,"The weight of the nails was 20 ounces of gold, and he overlaid the ceiling with gold."
2 Chronicles,3,10,"He made two cherubim of sculptured work, for the most holy place, and he overlaid them with gold."
2 Chronicles,3,11,"The overall length of the wings of the cherubim was 30 feet: the wing of one was 7½ feet, touching the wall of the room; its other wing was 7½ feet, touching the wing of the other cherub."
2 Chronicles,3,12,"The wing of the other cherub was 7½ feet, touching the wall of the room; its other wing was 7½ feet, reaching the wing of the other cherub."
2 Chronicles,3,13,The wingspan of these cherubim was 30 feet. They stood on their feet and faced the larger room.
2 Chronicles,3,14,"He made the veil of blue, purple, and crimson yarn and fine linen, and he wove cherubim into it."
2 Chronicles,3,15,"In front of the temple he made two pillars, each 27 feet high. The capital on top of each was 7½ feet high."
2 Chronicles,3,16,He had made chainwork in the inner sanctuary and also put it on top of the pillars. He made 100 pomegranates and fastened them into the chainwork.
2 Chronicles,3,17,"Then he set up the pillars in front of the sanctuary, one on the right and one on the left. He named the one on the right Jachin and the one on the left Boaz."
2 Chronicles,4,1,"He made a bronze altar 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 15 feet high."
2 Chronicles,4,2,"Then he made the cast metal reservoir, 15 feet from brim to brim, perfectly round. It was 7½ feet high and 45 feet in circumference."
2 Chronicles,4,3,"The likeness of oxen was below it, completely encircling it, 10 every half yard, completely surrounding the reservoir. The oxen were cast in two rows when the reservoir was cast."
2 Chronicles,4,4,"It stood on 12 oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The reservoir was on top of them and all their hindquarters were toward the center."
2 Chronicles,4,5,"The reservoir was three inches thick, and its rim was fashioned like the brim of a cup or a lily blossom. It could hold 11,000 gallons."
2 Chronicles,4,6,"He made 10 basins for washing and he put five on the right and five on the left. The parts of the burnt offering were rinsed in them, but the reservoir was used by the priests for washing."
2 Chronicles,4,7,"He made the 10 gold lampstands according to their specifications and put them in the sanctuary, five on the right and five on the left."
2 Chronicles,4,8,"He made 10 tables and placed them in the sanctuary, five on the right and five on the left. He also made 100 gold bowls."
2 Chronicles,4,9,"He made the courtyard of the priests and the large court, and doors for the court. He overlaid the doors with bronze."
2 Chronicles,4,10,"He put the reservoir on the right side, toward the southeast."
2 Chronicles,4,11,So Huram finished doing the work that he was doing for King Solomon in God’s temple:
2 Chronicles,4,12,two pillars; the bowls and the capitals on top of the two pillars; the two gratings for covering both bowls of the capitals that were on top of the pillars;
2 Chronicles,4,13,the 400 pomegranates for the two gratings (two rows of pomegranates for each grating covering both capitals’ bowls on top of the pillars).
2 Chronicles,4,14,He also made the water carts and the basins on the water carts.
2 Chronicles,4,15,"The one reservoir and the 12 oxen underneath it,"
2 Chronicles,4,16,"the pots, the shovels, the forks, and all their utensils—Huram-abi made them for King Solomon for the LORD’s temple. All these were made of polished bronze."
2 Chronicles,4,17,The king had them cast in clay molds in the Jordan Valley between Succoth and Zeredah.
2 Chronicles,4,18,Solomon made all these utensils in such great abundance that the weight of the bronze was not determined.
2 Chronicles,4,19,Solomon also made all the equipment in God’s temple: the gold altar; the tables on which to put the bread of the Presence;
2 Chronicles,4,20,the lampstands and their lamps of pure gold to burn in front of the inner sanctuary according to specifications;
2 Chronicles,4,21,"the flowers, lamps, and gold tongs—of purest gold;"
2 Chronicles,4,22,"the wick trimmers, sprinkling basins, ladles, and firepans—of purest gold; and the entryway to the temple, its inner doors to the most holy place, and the doors of the temple sanctuary—of gold."
2 Chronicles,5,1,"So all the work Solomon did for the LORD’s temple was completed. Then Solomon brought the consecrated things of his father David—the silver, the gold, and all the utensils—and put them in the treasuries of God’s temple."
2 Chronicles,5,2,"At that time Solomon assembled at Jerusalem the elders of Israel—all the tribal heads, the ancestral chiefs of the Israelites—in order to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD up from the city of David, that is, Zion."
2 Chronicles,5,3,So all the men of Israel were assembled in the king’s presence at the festival; this was in the seventh month.
2 Chronicles,5,4,"All the elders of Israel came, and the Levites picked up the ark."
2 Chronicles,5,5,"They brought up the ark, the tent of meeting, and the holy utensils that were in the tent. The priests and the Levites brought them up."
2 Chronicles,5,6,King Solomon and the entire congregation of Israel who had gathered around him were in front of the ark sacrificing sheep and cattle that could not be counted or numbered because there were so many.
2 Chronicles,5,7,"The priests brought the ark of the LORD’s covenant to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the temple, to the most holy place, beneath the wings of the cherubim."
2 Chronicles,5,8,And the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark so that the cherubim formed a cover above the ark and its poles.
2 Chronicles,5,9,"The poles were so long that their ends were seen from the holy place in front of the inner sanctuary, but they were not seen from outside; they are there to this very day."
2 Chronicles,5,10,"Nothing was in the ark except the two tablets that Moses had put in it at Horeb, where the LORD had made a covenant with the Israelites when they came out of Egypt."
2 Chronicles,5,11,"Now all the priests who were present had consecrated themselves regardless of their divisions. When the priests came out of the holy place,"
2 Chronicles,5,12,"the Levitical singers dressed in fine linen and carrying cymbals, harps, and lyres were standing east of the altar, and with them were 120 priests blowing trumpets. The Levitical singers were descendants of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun and their sons and relatives."
2 Chronicles,5,13,"The trumpeters and singers joined together to praise and thank the LORD with one voice. They raised their voices, accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and musical instruments, in praise to the LORD: For He is good; His faithful love endures forever. The temple, the LORD’s temple, was filled with a cloud."
2 Chronicles,5,14,"And because of the cloud, the priests were not able to continue ministering, for the glory of the LORD filled God’s temple."
2 Chronicles,6,1,"Then Solomon said: The LORD said He would dwell in thick darkness,"
2 Chronicles,6,2,"but I have built an exalted temple for You, a place for Your residence forever."
2 Chronicles,6,3,Then the king turned and blessed the entire congregation of Israel while they were standing.
2 Chronicles,6,4,"He said: May the LORD God of Israel be praised! He spoke directly to my father David, and He has fulfilled the promise by His power. He said,"
2 Chronicles,6,5,"“Since the day I brought My people Israel out of the land of Egypt, I have not chosen a city to build a temple in among any of the tribes of Israel, so that My name would be there, and I have not chosen a man to be ruler over My people Israel."
2 Chronicles,6,6,"But I have chosen Jerusalem so that My name will be there, and I have chosen David to be over My people Israel.”"
2 Chronicles,6,7,"Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a temple for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,6,8,"However, Yahweh said to my father David, “Since it was your desire to build a temple for My name, you have done well to have this desire."
2 Chronicles,6,9,"Yet, you are not the one to build the temple, but your son, your own offspring, will build the temple for My name.”"
2 Chronicles,6,10,"So Yahweh has fulfilled what He promised. I have taken the place of my father David and I sit on the throne of Israel, as Yahweh promised. I have built the temple for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,6,11,"I have put the ark there, where Yahweh’s covenant is that He made with the Israelites."
2 Chronicles,6,12,Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the entire congregation of Israel and spread out his hands.
2 Chronicles,6,13,"For Solomon had made a bronze platform 7½ feet long, 7½ feet wide, and 4½ feet high and put it in the court. He stood on it, knelt down in front of the entire congregation of Israel, and spread out his hands toward heaven."
2 Chronicles,6,14,"He said: LORD God of Israel, there is no God like You in heaven or on earth, keeping His gracious covenant with Your servants who walk before You with their whole heart."
2 Chronicles,6,15,"You have kept what You promised to Your servant, my father David. You spoke directly to him, and You fulfilled Your promise by Your power, as it is today."
2 Chronicles,6,16,"Therefore, LORD God of Israel, keep what You promised to Your servant, my father David: “You will never fail to have a man to sit before Me on the throne of Israel, if only your sons guard their way to walk in My Law as you have walked before Me.”"
2 Chronicles,6,17,"Now, LORD God of Israel, please confirm what You promised to Your servant David."
2 Chronicles,6,18,"But will God indeed live on earth with man? Even heaven, the highest heaven, cannot contain You, much less this temple I have built."
2 Chronicles,6,19,"Listen to Your servant’s prayer and his petition, LORD my God, so that You may hear the cry and the prayer that Your servant prays before You,"
2 Chronicles,6,20,"so that Your eyes watch over this temple day and night, toward the place where You said You would put Your name; and so that You may hear the prayer Your servant prays toward this place."
2 Chronicles,6,21,"Hear the petitions of Your servant and Your people Israel, which they pray toward this place. May You hear in Your dwelling place in heaven. May You hear and forgive."
2 Chronicles,6,22,"If a man sins against his neighbor and is forced to take an oath and he comes to take an oath before Your altar in this temple,"
2 Chronicles,6,23,"may You hear in heaven and act. May You judge Your servants, condemning the wicked man by bringing what he has done on his own head and providing justice for the righteous by rewarding him according to his righteousness."
2 Chronicles,6,24,"If Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy, because they have sinned against You, and they return to You and praise Your name, and they pray and plead for mercy before You in this temple,"
2 Chronicles,6,25,may You hear in heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel. May You restore them to the land You gave them and their ancestors.
2 Chronicles,6,26,"When the skies are shut and there is no rain because they have sinned against You, and they pray toward this place and praise Your name, and they turn from their sins because You are afflicting them,"
2 Chronicles,6,27,"may You hear in heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants and Your people Israel, so that You may teach them the good way they should walk in. May You send rain on Your land that You gave Your people for an inheritance."
2 Chronicles,6,28,"When there is famine on the earth, when there is pestilence, when there is blight, mildew, locust, or grasshopper, when their enemies besiege them in the region of their fortified cities, when there is any plague or illness,"
2 Chronicles,6,29,"whatever prayer or petition anyone from your people Israel might have— each man knowing his own affliction and suffering, and spreading out his hands toward this temple—"
2 Chronicles,6,30,"may You hear in heaven, Your dwelling place, and may You forgive and repay the man according to all his ways, since You know his heart, for You alone know the human heart,"
2 Chronicles,6,31,so that they may fear You and walk in Your ways all the days they live on the land You gave our ancestors.
2 Chronicles,6,32,"Even for the foreigner who is not of Your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of Your great name and Your mighty hand and outstretched arm: when he comes and prays toward this temple,"
2 Chronicles,6,33,"may You hear in heaven in Your dwelling place, and do all the foreigner asks You. Then all the peoples of the earth will know Your name, to fear You as Your people Israel do and know that this temple I have built is called by Your name."
2 Chronicles,6,34,"When Your people go out to fight against their enemies, wherever You send them, and they pray to You in the direction of this city You have chosen and the temple that I have built for Your name,"
2 Chronicles,6,35,may You hear their prayer and petition in heaven and uphold their cause.
2 Chronicles,6,36,"When they sin against You— for there is no one who does not sin— and You are angry with them and hand them over to the enemy, and their captors deport them to a distant or nearby country,"
2 Chronicles,6,37,"and when they come to their senses in the land where they were deported and repent and petition You in their captors’ land, saying: “We have sinned and done wrong; we have been wicked,”"
2 Chronicles,6,38,"and when they return to You with their whole mind and heart in the land of their captivity where they were taken captive, and when they pray in the direction of their land that You gave their ancestors, and the city You have chosen, and toward the temple I have built for Your name,"
2 Chronicles,6,39,"may You hear their prayer and petitions in heaven, Your dwelling place, and uphold their cause. May You forgive Your people who sinned against You."
2 Chronicles,6,40,"Now, my God, please let Your eyes be open and Your ears attentive to the prayer of this place."
2 Chronicles,6,41,"Now therefore: Arise, LORD God, come to Your resting place, You and Your powerful ark. May Your priests, LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and may Your godly people rejoice in goodness."
2 Chronicles,6,42,"LORD God, do not reject Your anointed one; remember the loyalty of Your servant David."
2 Chronicles,7,1,"When Solomon finished praying, fire descended from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the LORD filled the temple."
2 Chronicles,7,2,The priests were not able to enter the LORD’s temple because the glory of the LORD filled the temple of the LORD.
2 Chronicles,7,3,"All the Israelites were watching when the fire descended and the glory of the LORD came on the temple. They bowed down on the pavement with their faces to the ground. They worshiped and praised the LORD: For He is good, for His faithful love endures forever."
2 Chronicles,7,4,The king and all the people were offering sacrifices in the LORD’s presence.
2 Chronicles,7,5,"King Solomon offered a sacrifice of 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep. In this manner the king and all the people dedicated God’s temple."
2 Chronicles,7,6,"The priests and the Levites were standing at their stations. The Levites had the musical instruments of the LORD, which King David had made to praise the LORD—“for His faithful love endures forever”—when he offered praise with them. Across from the Levites, the priests were blowing trumpets, and all the people were standing."
2 Chronicles,7,7,"Since the bronze altar that Solomon had made could not accommodate the burnt offering, the grain offering, and the fat of the fellowship offerings, Solomon first consecrated the middle of the courtyard that was in front of the LORD’s temple and then offered the burnt offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings there."
2 Chronicles,7,8,"So Solomon and all Israel with him—a very great assembly, from the entrance to Hamath to the Brook of Egypt—observed the festival at that time for seven days."
2 Chronicles,7,9,"On the eighth day they held a sacred assembly, for the dedication of the altar lasted seven days and the festival seven days."
2 Chronicles,7,10,"On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, rejoicing and with happy hearts for the goodness the LORD had done for David, for Solomon, and for His people Israel."
2 Chronicles,7,11,So Solomon finished the LORD’s temple and the royal palace. Everything that had entered Solomon’s heart to do for the LORD’s temple and for his own palace succeeded.
2 Chronicles,7,12,Then the LORD appeared to Solomon at night and said to him: I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for Myself as a temple of sacrifice.
2 Chronicles,7,13,"If I close the sky so there is no rain, or if I command the grasshopper to consume the land, or if I send pestilence on My people,"
2 Chronicles,7,14,"and My people who are called by My name humble themselves, pray and seek My face, and turn from their evil ways, then I will hear from heaven, forgive their sin, and heal their land."
2 Chronicles,7,15,My eyes will now be open and My ears attentive to prayer from this place.
2 Chronicles,7,16,And I have now chosen and consecrated this temple so that My name may be there forever; My eyes and My heart will be there at all times.
2 Chronicles,7,17,"As for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, doing everything I have commanded you, and if you keep My statutes and ordinances,"
2 Chronicles,7,18,"I will establish your royal throne, as I promised your father David: You will never fail to have a man ruling in Israel."
2 Chronicles,7,19,"However, if you turn away and abandon My statutes and My commands that I have set before you and if you go and serve other gods and worship them,"
2 Chronicles,7,20,"then I will uproot Israel from the soil that I gave them, and this temple that I have sanctified for My name I will banish from My presence; I will make it an object of scorn and ridicule among all the peoples."
2 Chronicles,7,21,"As for this temple, which was exalted, everyone who passes by will be appalled and will say: Why did the LORD do this to this land and this temple?"
2 Chronicles,7,22,"Then they will say: Because they abandoned the LORD God of their ancestors who brought them out of the land of Egypt. They clung to other gods and worshiped and served them. Because of this, He brought all this ruin on them."
2 Chronicles,8,1,At the end of 20 years during which Solomon had built the LORD’s temple and his own palace—
2 Chronicles,8,2,Solomon had rebuilt the cities Hiram gave him and settled Israelites there—
2 Chronicles,8,3,Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and seized it.
2 Chronicles,8,4,He built Tadmor in the wilderness along with all the storage cities that he built in Hamath.
2 Chronicles,8,5,"He built Upper Beth-horon and Lower Beth-horon—fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars—"
2 Chronicles,8,6,"Baalath, all the storage cities that belonged to Solomon, all the chariot cities, the cavalry cities, and everything Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, or anywhere else in the land of his dominion."
2 Chronicles,8,7,"As for all the peoples who remained of the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not from Israel—"
2 Chronicles,8,8,"their descendants who remained in the land after them, those the Israelites had not completely destroyed—Solomon imposed forced labor on them; it is this way today."
2 Chronicles,8,9,"But Solomon did not consign the Israelites to be slaves for his work; they were soldiers, commanders of his captains, and commanders of his chariots and his cavalry."
2 Chronicles,8,10,These were King Solomon’s deputies: 250 who ruled over the people.
2 Chronicles,8,11,"Solomon brought the daughter of Pharaoh from the city of David to the house he had built for her, for he said, “My wife must not live in the house of David king of Israel because the places the ark of the LORD has come into are holy.”"
2 Chronicles,8,12,At that time Solomon offered burnt offerings to the LORD on the LORD’s altar he had made in front of the portico.
2 Chronicles,8,13,"He followed the daily requirement for offerings according to the commandment of Moses for Sabbaths, New Moons, and the three annual appointed festivals: the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks, and the Festival of Booths."
2 Chronicles,8,14,"According to the ordinances of his father David, he appointed the divisions of the priests over their service, of the Levites over their responsibilities to offer praise and to minister before the priests following the daily requirement, and of the gatekeepers by their divisions with respect to each gate, for this had been the command of David, the man of God."
2 Chronicles,8,15,They did not turn aside from the king’s command regarding the priests and the Levites concerning any matter or concerning the treasuries.
2 Chronicles,8,16,All of Solomon’s work was carried out from the day the foundation was laid for the LORD’s temple until it was finished. So the LORD’s temple was completed.
2 Chronicles,8,17,At that time Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Eloth on the seashore in the land of Edom.
2 Chronicles,8,18,"So Hiram sent ships to him by his servants along with crews of experienced seamen. They went with Solomon’s servants to Ophir, took from there 17 tons of gold, and delivered it to King Solomon."
2 Chronicles,9,1,"The queen of Sheba heard of Solomon’s fame, so she came to test Solomon with difficult questions at Jerusalem with a very large entourage, with camels bearing spices, gold in abundance, and precious stones. She came to Solomon and spoke with him about everything that was on her mind."
2 Chronicles,9,2,So Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too difficult for Solomon to explain to her.
2 Chronicles,9,3,"When the queen of Sheba observed Solomon’s wisdom, the palace he had built,"
2 Chronicles,9,4,"the food at his table, his servants’ residence, his attendants’ service and their attire, his cupbearers and their attire, and the burnt offerings he offered at the LORD’s temple, it took her breath away."
2 Chronicles,9,5,"She said to the king, “The report I heard in my own country about your words and about your wisdom is true."
2 Chronicles,9,6,"But I didn’t believe their reports until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, I was not even told half of your great wisdom! You far exceed the report I heard."
2 Chronicles,9,7,"How happy are your men. How happy are these servants of yours, who always stand in your presence hearing your wisdom."
2 Chronicles,9,8,"May the LORD your God be praised! He delighted in you and put you on His throne as king for the LORD your God. Because Your God loved Israel enough to establish them forever, He has set you over them as king to carry out justice and righteousness.”"
2 Chronicles,9,9,"Then she gave the king four and a half tons of gold, a great quantity of spices, and precious stones. There never were such spices as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon."
2 Chronicles,9,10,"In addition, Hiram’s servants and Solomon’s servants who brought gold from Ophir also brought algum wood and precious stones."
2 Chronicles,9,11,The king made the algum wood into walkways for the LORD’s temple and for the king’s palace and into lyres and harps for the singers. Never before had anything like them been seen in the land of Judah.
2 Chronicles,9,12,"King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba her every desire, whatever she asked—far more than she had brought the king. Then she, along with her servants, returned to her own country."
2 Chronicles,9,13,"The weight of gold that came to Solomon annually was 25 tons,"
2 Chronicles,9,14,besides what was brought by the merchants and traders. All the Arabian kings and governors of the land also brought gold and silver to Solomon.
2 Chronicles,9,15,King Solomon made 200 large shields of hammered gold; 15 pounds of hammered gold went into each shield.
2 Chronicles,9,16,He made 300 small shields of hammered gold; about eight pounds of gold went into each shield. The king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
2 Chronicles,9,17,The king also made a large ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold.
2 Chronicles,9,18,"The throne had six steps; there was a footstool covered in gold for the throne, armrests on either side of the seat, and two lions standing beside the armrests."
2 Chronicles,9,19,"Twelve lions were standing there on the six steps, one at each end. Nothing like it had ever been made in any other kingdom."
2 Chronicles,9,20,"All of King Solomon’s drinking cups were gold, and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. There was no silver, since it was considered as nothing in Solomon’s time,"
2 Chronicles,9,21,"for the king’s ships kept going to Tarshish with Hiram’s servants, and once every three years the ships of Tarshish would arrive bearing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks."
2 Chronicles,9,22,King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the world in riches and wisdom.
2 Chronicles,9,23,All the kings of the world wanted an audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom God had put in his heart.
2 Chronicles,9,24,"Each of them would bring his own gift—items of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, and horses and mules—as an annual tribute."
2 Chronicles,9,25,"Solomon had 4,000 stalls for horses and chariots, and 12,000 horsemen. He stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,9,26,He ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines and as far as the border of Egypt.
2 Chronicles,9,27,"The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar as abundant as sycamore in the Judean foothills."
2 Chronicles,9,28,They were bringing horses for Solomon from Egypt and from all the countries.
2 Chronicles,9,29,"The remaining events of Solomon’s reign, from beginning to end, are written in the Events of Nathan the Prophet, the Prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and the Visions of Iddo the Seer concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat."
2 Chronicles,9,30,Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel for 40 years.
2 Chronicles,9,31,Solomon rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David. His son Rehoboam became king in his place.
2 Chronicles,10,1,"Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone to Shechem to make him king."
2 Chronicles,10,2,When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard about it—for he was in Egypt where he had fled from King Solomon’s presence—Jeroboam returned from Egypt.
2 Chronicles,10,3,So they summoned him. Then Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam:
2 Chronicles,10,4,"“Your father made our yoke difficult. Therefore, lighten your father’s harsh service and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.”"
2 Chronicles,10,5,"Rehoboam replied, “Return to me in three days.” So the people left."
2 Chronicles,10,6,"Then King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon when he was alive, asking, “How do you advise me to respond to these people?”"
2 Chronicles,10,7,"They replied, “If you will be kind to these people and please them by speaking kind words to them, they will be your servants forever.”"
2 Chronicles,10,8,"But he rejected the advice of the elders who had advised him, and he consulted with the young men who had grown up with him, the ones serving him."
2 Chronicles,10,9,"He asked them, “What message do you advise we send back to these people who said to me, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us’?”"
2 Chronicles,10,10,"Then the young men who had grown up with him told him, “This is what you should say to the people who said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you, make it lighter on us!’ This is what you should say to them: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins."
2 Chronicles,10,11,"Now therefore, my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, but I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I, with barbed whips.’”"
2 Chronicles,10,12,"So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, just as the king had ordered, saying, “Return to me on the third day.”"
2 Chronicles,10,13,Then the king answered them harshly. King Rehoboam rejected the elders’ advice
2 Chronicles,10,14,"and spoke to them according to the young men’s advice, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father disciplined you with whips, but I, with barbed whips.”"
2 Chronicles,10,15,"The king did not listen to the people because the turn of events came from God, in order that the LORD might carry out His word that He had spoken through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat."
2 Chronicles,10,16,"When all Israel saw that the king had not listened to them, the people answered the king: What portion do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Israel, each man to your tent; David, look after your own house now! So all Israel went to their tents."
2 Chronicles,10,17,"But as for the Israelites living in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them."
2 Chronicles,10,18,"Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was in charge of the forced labor, but the Israelites stoned him to death. However, King Rehoboam managed to get into his chariot to flee to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,10,19,Israel is in rebellion against the house of David until today.
2 Chronicles,11,1,"When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mobilized the house of Judah and Benjamin—180,000 choice warriors—to fight against Israel to restore the reign to Rehoboam."
2 Chronicles,11,2,"But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, the man of God:"
2 Chronicles,11,3,"“Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon, king of Judah, to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people:"
2 Chronicles,11,4,"‘This is what the LORD says: You are not to march up and fight against your brothers. Each of you must return home, for this incident has come from Me.’” So they listened to what the LORD said and turned back from going against Jeroboam."
2 Chronicles,11,5,"Rehoboam stayed in Jerusalem, and he fortified cities in Judah."
2 Chronicles,11,6,"He built up Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,"
2 Chronicles,11,7,"Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam,"
2 Chronicles,11,8,"Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,"
2 Chronicles,11,9,"Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,"
2 Chronicles,11,10,"Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which are fortified cities in Judah and in Benjamin."
2 Chronicles,11,11,"He strengthened their fortifications and put leaders in them with supplies of food, oil, and wine."
2 Chronicles,11,12,He also put large shields and spears in each and every city to make them very strong. So Judah and Benjamin were his.
2 Chronicles,11,13,"The priests and Levites from all their regions throughout Israel took their stand with Rehoboam,"
2 Chronicles,11,14,"for the Levites left their pasturelands and their possessions and went to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons refused to let them serve as priests of Yahweh."
2 Chronicles,11,15,"Jeroboam appointed his own priests for the high places, the goat-demons, and the golden calves he had made."
2 Chronicles,11,16,"Those from every tribe of Israel who had determined in their hearts to seek Yahweh their God followed the Levites to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Yahweh, the God of their ancestors."
2 Chronicles,11,17,"So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam son of Solomon for three years, because they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years."
2 Chronicles,11,18,"Rehoboam married Mahalath, daughter of David’s son Jerimoth and of Abihail daughter of Jesse’s son Eliab."
2 Chronicles,11,19,"She bore sons to him: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham."
2 Chronicles,11,20,"After her, he married Maacah daughter of Absalom. She bore Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith to him."
2 Chronicles,11,21,Rehoboam loved Maacah daughter of Absalom more than all his wives and concubines. He acquired 18 wives and 60 concubines and was the father of 28 sons and 60 daughters.
2 Chronicles,11,22,"Rehoboam appointed Abijah son of Maacah as chief, leader among his brothers, intending to make him king."
2 Chronicles,11,23,Rehoboam also showed discernment by dispersing some of his sons to all the regions of Judah and Benjamin and to all the fortified cities. He gave them plenty of provisions and sought many wives for them.
2 Chronicles,12,1,"When Rehoboam had established his sovereignty and royal power, he abandoned the law of the LORD—he and all Israel with him."
2 Chronicles,12,2,"Because they were unfaithful to the LORD, in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt went to war against Jerusalem"
2 Chronicles,12,3,"with 1,200 chariots, 60,000 cavalrymen, and countless people who came with him from Egypt—Libyans, Sukkiim, and Cushites."
2 Chronicles,12,4,He captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,12,5,"Then Shemaiah the prophet went to Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah who were gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak. He said to them: “This is what the LORD says: ‘You have abandoned Me; therefore, I have abandoned you into the hand of Shishak.’”"
2 Chronicles,12,6,"So the leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, “Yahweh is righteous.”"
2 Chronicles,12,7,"When the LORD saw that they had humbled themselves, the LORD’s message came to Shemaiah: “They have humbled themselves; I will not destroy them but will grant them a little deliverance. My wrath will not be poured out on Jerusalem through Shishak."
2 Chronicles,12,8,"However, they will become his servants so that they may recognize the difference between serving Me and serving the kingdoms of other lands.”"
2 Chronicles,12,9,So King Shishak of Egypt went to war against Jerusalem. He seized the treasuries of the LORD’s temple and the treasuries of the royal palace. He took everything. He took the gold shields that Solomon had made.
2 Chronicles,12,10,King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place and committed them into the care of the captains of the royal escorts who guarded the entrance to the king’s palace.
2 Chronicles,12,11,"Whenever the king entered the LORD’s temple, the royal escorts would carry the shields and take them back to the royal escorts’ armory."
2 Chronicles,12,12,"When Rehoboam humbled himself, the LORD’s anger turned away from him, and He did not destroy him completely. Besides that, conditions were good in Judah."
2 Chronicles,12,13,"King Rehoboam established his royal power in Jerusalem. Rehoboam was 41 years old when he became king and reigned 17 years in Jerusalem, the city the LORD had chosen from all the tribes of Israel to put His name. Rehoboam’s mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonite."
2 Chronicles,12,14,"Rehoboam did what was evil, because he did not determine in his heart to seek the LORD."
2 Chronicles,12,15,"The events of Rehoboam’s reign, from beginning to end, are written in the Events of Shemaiah the Prophet and of Iddo the Seer concerning genealogies. There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout their reigns."
2 Chronicles,12,16,Rehoboam rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of David. His son Abijah became king in his place.
2 Chronicles,13,1,"In the eighteenth year of Israel’s King Jeroboam, Abijah became king over Judah"
2 Chronicles,13,2,and reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Micaiah daughter of Uriel; she was from Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
2 Chronicles,13,3,"Abijah set his army of warriors in order with 400,000 choice men. Jeroboam arranged his mighty army of 800,000 choice men in battle formation against him."
2 Chronicles,13,4,"Then Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, “Jeroboam and all Israel, hear me."
2 Chronicles,13,5,Don’t you know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingship over Israel to David and his descendants forever by a covenant of salt?
2 Chronicles,13,6,"But Jeroboam son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon son of David, rose up and rebelled against his lord."
2 Chronicles,13,7,"Then worthless and wicked men gathered around him to resist Rehoboam son of Solomon when Rehoboam was young, inexperienced, and unable to assert himself against them."
2 Chronicles,13,8,"“And now you are saying you can assert yourselves against the LORD’s kingdom, which is in the hand of one of David’s sons. You are a vast number and have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made for you as gods."
2 Chronicles,13,9,"Didn’t you banish the priests of Yahweh, the descendants of Aaron and the Levites, and make your own priests like the peoples of other lands do? Whoever comes to ordain himself with a young bull and seven rams may become a priest of what are not gods."
2 Chronicles,13,10,"“But as for us, Yahweh is our God. We have not abandoned Him; the priests ministering to the LORD are descendants of Aaron, and the Levites serve at their tasks."
2 Chronicles,13,11,"They offer a burnt offering and fragrant incense to the LORD every morning and every evening, and they set the rows of the bread of the Presence on the ceremonially clean table. They light the lamps of the gold lampstand every evening. We are carrying out the requirements of Yahweh our God, while you have abandoned Him."
2 Chronicles,13,12,"Look, God and His priests are with us at our head. The trumpets are ready to sound the charge against you. Israelites, don’t fight against the LORD God of your ancestors, for you will not succeed.”"
2 Chronicles,13,13,"Now Jeroboam had sent an ambush around to advance from behind them. So they were in front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them."
2 Chronicles,13,14,"Judah turned and discovered that the battle was in front of them and behind them, so they cried out to the LORD. Then the priests blew the trumpets,"
2 Chronicles,13,15,"and the men of Judah raised the battle cry. When the men of Judah raised the battle cry, God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah."
2 Chronicles,13,16,"So the Israelites fled before Judah, and God handed them over to them."
2 Chronicles,13,17,"Then Abijah and his people struck them with a mighty blow, and 500,000 choice men of Israel were killed."
2 Chronicles,13,18,"The Israelites were subdued at that time. The Judahites succeeded because they depended on the LORD, the God of their ancestors."
2 Chronicles,13,19,"Abijah pursued Jeroboam and captured some cities from him: Bethel and its villages, Jeshanah and its villages, and Ephron and its villages."
2 Chronicles,13,20,"Jeroboam no longer retained his power during Abijah’s reign; ultimately, the LORD struck him and he died."
2 Chronicles,13,21,"However, Abijah grew strong, acquired 14 wives, and fathered 22 sons and 16 daughters."
2 Chronicles,13,22,"The rest of the events of Abijah’s reign, along with his ways and his sayings, are written in the Writing of the Prophet Iddo."
2 Chronicles,14,1,Abijah rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of David. His son Asa became king in his place. During his reign the land experienced peace for 10 years.
2 Chronicles,14,2,Asa did what was good and right in the sight of the LORD his God.
2 Chronicles,14,3,He removed the pagan altars and the high places. He shattered their sacred pillars and chopped down their Asherah poles.
2 Chronicles,14,4,He told the people of Judah to seek the LORD God of their ancestors and to carry out the instruction and the commands.
2 Chronicles,14,5,"He also removed the high places and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah, and the kingdom experienced peace under him."
2 Chronicles,14,6,"Because the land experienced peace, Asa built fortified cities in Judah. No one made war with him in those days because the LORD gave him rest."
2 Chronicles,14,7,"So he said to the people of Judah, “Let’s build these cities and surround them with walls and towers, with doors and bars. The land is still ours because we sought the LORD our God. We sought Him and He gave us rest on every side.” So they built and succeeded."
2 Chronicles,14,8,"Asa had an army of 300,000 from Judah bearing large shields and spears, and 280,000 from Benjamin bearing regular shields and drawing the bow. All these were brave warriors."
2 Chronicles,14,9,Then Zerah the Cushite came against them with an army of one million men and 300 chariots. They came as far as Mareshah.
2 Chronicles,14,10,So Asa marched out against him and lined up in battle formation in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
2 Chronicles,14,11,"Then Asa cried out to the LORD his God: “LORD, there is no one besides You to help the mighty and those without strength. Help us, LORD our God, for we depend on You, and in Your name we have come against this large army. Yahweh, You are our God. Do not let a mere mortal hinder You.”"
2 Chronicles,14,12,"So the LORD routed the Cushites before Asa and before Judah, and the Cushites fled."
2 Chronicles,14,13,"Then Asa and the people who were with him pursued them as far as Gerar. The Cushites fell until they had no survivors, for they were crushed before Yahweh and His army. So the people of Judah carried off a great supply of loot."
2 Chronicles,14,14,"Then they attacked all the cities around Gerar because the terror of the LORD was on them. They also plundered all the cities, since there was a great deal of plunder in them."
2 Chronicles,14,15,They also attacked the tents of the herdsmen and captured many sheep and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,15,1,The Spirit of God came on Azariah son of Oded.
2 Chronicles,15,2,"So he went out to meet Asa and said to him, “Asa and all Judah and Benjamin, hear me. The LORD is with you when you are with Him. If you seek Him, He will be found by you, but if you abandon Him, He will abandon you."
2 Chronicles,15,3,"For many years Israel has been without the true God, without a teaching priest, and without instruction,"
2 Chronicles,15,4,"but when they turned to the LORD God of Israel in their distress and sought Him, He was found by them."
2 Chronicles,15,5,In those times there was no peace for those who went about their daily activities because the residents of the lands had many conflicts.
2 Chronicles,15,6,"Nation was crushed by nation and city by city, for God troubled them with every possible distress."
2 Chronicles,15,7,"But as for you, be strong; don’t be discouraged, for your work has a reward.”"
2 Chronicles,15,8,"When Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Azariah son of Oded the prophet, he took courage and removed the detestable idols from the whole land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities he had captured in the hill country of Ephraim. He renovated the altar of the LORD that was in front of the portico of the LORD’s temple."
2 Chronicles,15,9,"Then he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, as well as those from the tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who had settled among them, for they had defected to him from Israel in great numbers when they saw that Yahweh his God was with him."
2 Chronicles,15,10,They were gathered in Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign.
2 Chronicles,15,11,"At that time they sacrificed to the LORD 700 cattle and 7,000 sheep from all the plunder they had brought."
2 Chronicles,15,12,Then they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their ancestors with all their mind and all their heart.
2 Chronicles,15,13,"Whoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel would be put to death, young or old, man or woman."
2 Chronicles,15,14,"They took an oath to the LORD in a loud voice, with shouting, with trumpets, and with rams’ horns."
2 Chronicles,15,15,"All Judah rejoiced over the oath, for they had sworn it with all their mind. They had sought Him with all their heart, and He was found by them. So the LORD gave them rest on every side."
2 Chronicles,15,16,"King Asa also removed Maacah, his grandmother, from being queen mother because she had made an obscene image of Asherah. Asa chopped down her obscene image, then crushed it and burned it in the Kidron Valley."
2 Chronicles,15,17,"The high places were not taken away from Israel; nevertheless, Asa was wholehearted his entire life."
2 Chronicles,15,18,"He brought his father’s consecrated gifts and his own consecrated gifts into God’s temple: silver, gold, and utensils."
2 Chronicles,15,19,There was no war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign.
2 Chronicles,16,1,"In the thirty-sixth year of Asa, Israel’s King Baasha went to war against Judah. He built Ramah in order to deny access to anyone—going or coming—to Judah’s King Asa."
2 Chronicles,16,2,"So Asa brought out the silver and gold from the treasuries of the LORD’s temple and the royal palace and sent it to Aram’s King Ben-hadad, who lived in Damascus, saying,"
2 Chronicles,16,3,"“There’s a treaty between me and you, between my father and your father. Look, I have sent you silver and gold. Go break your treaty with Israel’s King Baasha so that he will withdraw from me.”"
2 Chronicles,16,4,"Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies to the cities of Israel. They attacked Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali."
2 Chronicles,16,5,"When Baasha heard about it, he quit building Ramah and stopped his work."
2 Chronicles,16,6,"Then King Asa brought all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and the timbers Baasha had built it with. Then he built Geba and Mizpah with them."
2 Chronicles,16,7,"At that time, Hanani the seer came to King Asa of Judah and said to him, “Because you depended on the king of Aram and have not depended on the LORD your God, the army of the king of Aram has escaped from your hand."
2 Chronicles,16,8,"Were not the Cushites and Libyans a vast army with many chariots and horsemen? When you depended on Yahweh, He handed them over to you."
2 Chronicles,16,9,"For the eyes of Yahweh roam throughout the earth to show Himself strong for those whose hearts are completely His. You have been foolish in this matter. Therefore, you will have wars from now on.”"
2 Chronicles,16,10,Asa was angry with the seer and put him in prison because of his anger over this. And Asa mistreated some of the people at that time.
2 Chronicles,16,11,"Note that the events of Asa’s reign, from beginning to end, are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel."
2 Chronicles,16,12,"In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa developed a disease in his feet, and his disease became increasingly severe. Yet even in his disease he didn’t seek the LORD but only the physicians."
2 Chronicles,16,13,Asa died in the forty-first year of his reign and rested with his fathers.
2 Chronicles,16,14,He was buried in his own tomb that he had made for himself in the city of David. They laid him out in a coffin that was full of spices and various mixtures of prepared ointments; then they made a great fire in his honor.
2 Chronicles,17,1,His son Jehoshaphat became king in his place and strengthened himself against Israel.
2 Chronicles,17,2,He stationed troops in every fortified city of Judah and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured.
2 Chronicles,17,3,Now the LORD was with Jehoshaphat because he walked in the former ways of his father David. He did not seek the Baals
2 Chronicles,17,4,"but sought the God of his father and walked by His commands, not according to the practices of Israel."
2 Chronicles,17,5,"So the LORD established the kingdom in his hand. Then all Judah brought him tribute, and he had riches and honor in abundance."
2 Chronicles,17,6,"His mind rejoiced in the LORD’s ways, and he again removed the high places and Asherah poles from Judah."
2 Chronicles,17,7,"In the third year of his reign, Jehoshaphat sent his officials—Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah—to teach in the cities of Judah."
2 Chronicles,17,8,"The Levites with them were Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah; the priests, Elishama and Jehoram, were with these Levites."
2 Chronicles,17,9,"They taught throughout Judah, having the book of the LORD’s instruction with them. They went throughout the towns of Judah and taught the people."
2 Chronicles,17,10,"The terror of the LORD was on all the kingdoms of the lands that surrounded Judah, so they didn’t fight against Jehoshaphat."
2 Chronicles,17,11,"Some of the Philistines also brought gifts and silver as tribute to Jehoshaphat, and the Arabs brought him flocks: 7,700 rams and 7,700 male goats."
2 Chronicles,17,12,Jehoshaphat grew stronger and stronger. He built fortresses and storage cities in Judah
2 Chronicles,17,13,"and carried out great works in the towns of Judah. He had fighting men, brave warriors, in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,17,14,"These are their numbers according to their ancestral families. For Judah, the commanders of thousands: Adnah the commander and 300,000 brave warriors with him;"
2 Chronicles,17,15,"next to him, Jehohanan the commander and 280,000 with him;"
2 Chronicles,17,16,"next to him, Amasiah son of Zichri, the volunteer of the LORD, and 200,000 brave warriors with him;"
2 Chronicles,17,17,"from Benjamin, Eliada, a brave warrior, and 200,000 with him armed with bow and shield;"
2 Chronicles,17,18,"next to him, Jehozabad and 180,000 with him equipped for war."
2 Chronicles,17,19,"These were the ones who served the king, besides those he stationed in the fortified cities throughout all Judah."
2 Chronicles,18,1,"Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance, and he made an alliance with Ahab through marriage."
2 Chronicles,18,2,"Then after some years, he went down to visit Ahab in Samaria. Ahab sacrificed many sheep and cattle for him and for the people who were with him. Then he persuaded him to march up to Ramoth-gilead,"
2 Chronicles,18,3,"for Israel’s King Ahab asked Judah’s King Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead?” He replied to him, “I am as you are, my people as your people; we will be with you in the battle.”"
2 Chronicles,18,4,"But Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “First, please ask what the LORD’s will is.”"
2 Chronicles,18,5,"So the king of Israel gathered the prophets, 400 men, and asked them, “Should we go to Ramoth-gilead for war or should I refrain?” They replied, “March up, and God will hand it over to the king.”"
2 Chronicles,18,6,"But Jehoshaphat asked, “Isn’t there a prophet of Yahweh here anymore? Let’s ask him.”"
2 Chronicles,18,7,"The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is still one man who can ask Yahweh, but I hate him because he never prophesies good about me, but only disaster. He is Micaiah son of Imlah.” “The king shouldn’t say that,” Jehoshaphat replied."
2 Chronicles,18,8,"So the king of Israel called an officer and said, “Hurry and get Micaiah son of Imlah!”"
2 Chronicles,18,9,"Now the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah, clothed in royal attire, were each sitting on his own throne. They were sitting on the threshing floor at the entrance to Samaria’s gate, and all the prophets were prophesying in front of them."

2 Chronicles,18,14,"So he went to the king, and the king asked him, “Micaiah, should we go to Ramoth-gilead for war, or should I refrain?” Micaiah said, “March up and succeed, for they will be handed over to you.”"

2 Chronicles,19,9,"He commanded them, saying, “In the fear of the LORD, with integrity, and with a whole heart, you are to do the following:"
2 Chronicles,19,10,"for every dispute that comes to you from your brothers who dwell in their cities—whether it regards differences of bloodguilt, law, commandment, statutes, or judgments—you are to warn them, so they will not incur guilt before the LORD and wrath will not come on you and your brothers. Do this, and you will not incur guilt."
2 Chronicles,19,11,"“Note that Amariah, the chief priest, is over you in all matters related to the LORD, and Zebadiah son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all matters related to the king, and the Levites are officers in your presence.

2 Chronicles,20,25,Then Jehoshaphat and his people went to gather the plunder. They found among them an abundance of goods on the bodies and valuable items. So they stripped them until nobody could carry any more. They were gathering the plunder for three days because there was so much.
2 Chronicles,20,26,"They assembled in the Valley of Beracah on the fourth day, for there they praised the LORD. Therefore, that place is still called the Valley of Beracah today."
2 Chronicles,20,27,"Then all the men of Judah and Jerusalem turned back with Jehoshaphat their leader, returning joyfully to Jerusalem, for the LORD enabled them to rejoice over their enemies."

2 Chronicles,20,29,The terror of God was on all the kingdoms of the lands when they heard that Yahweh had fought against the enemies of Israel.
2 Chronicles,20,30,"Then Jehoshaphat’s kingdom was quiet, for his God gave him rest on every side."
2 Chronicles,20,31,Jehoshaphat became king over Judah. He was 35 years old when he became king and reigned 25 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.
2 Chronicles,20,32,He walked in the way of Asa his father; he did not turn away from it but did what was right in the LORD’s sight.
2 Chronicles,20,33,"However, the high places were not taken away; the people had not yet set their hearts on the God of their ancestors."
2 Chronicles,20,34,"The rest of the events of Jehoshaphat’s reign from beginning to end are written in the Events of Jehu son of Hanani, which is recorded in the Book of Israel’s Kings."
2 Chronicles,20,35,"After this, Judah’s King Jehoshaphat made an alliance with Israel’s King Ahaziah, who was guilty of wrongdoing."
2 Chronicles,20,36,"Jehoshaphat formed an alliance with him to make ships to go to Tarshish, and they made the ships in Ezion-geber."
2 Chronicles,20,37,"Then Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, “Because you formed an alliance with Ahaziah, the LORD has broken up what you have made.” So the ships were wrecked and were not able to go to Tarshish."
2 Chronicles,21,1,Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. His son Jehoram became king in his place.
2 Chronicles,21,2,"He had brothers, sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah."
2 Chronicles,21,3,"Their father had given them many gifts of silver, gold, and valuable things, along with fortified cities in Judah, but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram because he was the firstborn."
2 Chronicles,21,4,"When Jehoram had established himself over his father’s kingdom, he strengthened his position by killing with the sword all his brothers as well as some of the princes of Israel."
2 Chronicles,21,5,Jehoram was 32 years old when he became king and reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,21,6,"He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for Ahab’s daughter was his wife. He did what was evil in the LORD’s sight,"
2 Chronicles,21,7,"but because of the covenant the LORD had made with David, He was unwilling to destroy the house of David since the LORD had promised to give a lamp to David and to his sons forever."
2 Chronicles,21,8,"During Jehoram’s reign, Edom rebelled against Judah’s domination and appointed their own king."
2 Chronicles,21,9,So Jehoram crossed into Edom with his commanders and all his chariots. Then at night he set out to attack the Edomites who had surrounded him and the chariot commanders.
2 Chronicles,21,10,"And now Edom is still in rebellion against Judah’s domination today. Libnah also rebelled at that time against his domination because he had abandoned Yahweh, the God of his ancestors."
2 Chronicles,21,11,"Jehoram also built high places in the hills of Judah, and he caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves, and he led Judah astray."
2 Chronicles,21,12,"Then a letter came to Jehoram from Elijah the prophet, saying: This is what Yahweh, the God of your ancestor David says: “Because you have not walked in the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or in the ways of Asa king of Judah"
2 Chronicles,21,13,"but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, have caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves like the house of Ahab prostituted itself, and also have killed your brothers, your father’s family, who were better than you,"
2 Chronicles,21,14,"Yahweh is now about to strike your people, your sons, your wives, and all your possessions with a horrible affliction."
2 Chronicles,21,15,"You yourself will be struck with many illnesses, including a disease of the intestines, until your intestines come out day after day because of the disease.”"
2 Chronicles,21,16,The LORD put it into the mind of the Philistines and the Arabs who live near the Cushites to attack Jehoram.
2 Chronicles,21,17,"So they went to war against Judah and invaded it. They carried off all the possessions found in the king’s palace and also his sons and wives; not a son was left to him except Jehoahaz, his youngest son."
2 Chronicles,21,18,"After all these things, the LORD afflicted him in his intestines with an incurable disease."
2 Chronicles,21,19,"This continued day after day until two full years passed. Then his intestines came out because of his disease, and he died from severe illnesses. But his people did not hold a fire in his honor like the fire in honor of his fathers."
2 Chronicles,21,20,Jehoram was 32 years old when he became king; he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. He died to no one’s regret and was buried in the city of David but not in the tombs of the kings.
2 Chronicles,22,1,"Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king in his place, because the troops that had come with the Arabs to the camp had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah."
2 Chronicles,22,2,"Ahaziah was 22 years old when he became king and reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah, granddaughter of Omri."
2 Chronicles,22,3,"He walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother gave him evil advice."
2 Chronicles,22,4,"So he did what was evil in the LORD’s sight like the house of Ahab, for they were his advisers after the death of his father, to his destruction."
2 Chronicles,22,5,"He also followed their advice and went with Joram son of Israel’s King Ahab to fight against Hazael, king of Aram, in Ramoth-gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram,"
2 Chronicles,22,6,so he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds they inflicted on him in Ramoth-gilead when he fought against Aram’s King Hazael. Then Judah’s King Ahaziah son of Jehoram went down to Jezreel to visit Joram son of Ahab since Joram was ill.
2 Chronicles,22,7,"Ahaziah’s downfall came from God when he went to Joram. When Ahaziah arrived, he went out with Joram to meet Jehu son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab."
2 Chronicles,22,8,"So when Jehu executed judgment on the house of Ahab, he found the rulers of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s brothers who were serving Ahaziah, and he killed them."
2 Chronicles,22,9,"Then Jehu looked for Ahaziah, and Jehu’s soldiers captured him (he was hiding in Samaria). So they brought Ahaziah to Jehu, and they killed him. The soldiers buried him, for they said, “He is the grandson of Jehoshaphat who sought the LORD with all his heart.” So no one from the house of Ahaziah had the strength to rule the kingdom."
2 Chronicles,22,10,"When Athaliah, Ahaziah’s mother, saw that her son was dead, she proceeded to annihilate all the royal heirs of the house of Judah."
2 Chronicles,22,11,"Jehoshabeath, the king’s daughter, rescued Joash son of Ahaziah from the king’s sons who were being killed and put him and the one who nursed him in a bedroom. Now Jehoshabeath was the daughter of King Jehoram and the wife of Jehoiada the priest. Since she was Ahaziah’s sister, she hid Joash from Athaliah so that she did not kill him."
2 Chronicles,22,12,"While Athaliah ruled over the land, he was hiding with them in God’s temple six years."
2 Chronicles,23,1,"Then, in the seventh year, Jehoiada summoned his courage and took the commanders of hundreds into a covenant with him: Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zichri."
2 Chronicles,23,2,"They made a circuit throughout Judah. They gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah and the heads of the families of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,23,3,"Then the whole assembly made a covenant with the king in God’s temple. Jehoiada said to them, “Here is the king’s son! He must reign, just as the LORD promised concerning David’s sons."
2 Chronicles,23,4,"This is what you are to do: a third of you, priests and Levites who are coming on duty on the Sabbath, are to be gatekeepers."
2 Chronicles,23,5,"A third are to be at the king’s palace, and a third are to be at the Foundation Gate, and all the troops will be in the courtyards of the LORD’s temple."
2 Chronicles,23,6,"No one is to enter the LORD’s temple but the priests and those Levites who serve; they may enter because they are holy, but all the people are to obey the requirement of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,23,7,You must completely surround the king with weapons in hand. Anyone who enters the temple is to be put to death. You must be with the king in all his daily tasks.”
2 Chronicles,23,8,So the commanders of hundreds did everything Jehoiada the priest commanded. They each brought their men—those coming on duty on the Sabbath and those going off duty on the Sabbath—for Jehoiada the priest did not release the divisions.
2 Chronicles,23,9,"Jehoiada the priest gave to the commanders of hundreds King David’s spears, shields, and quivers that were in God’s temple."
2 Chronicles,23,10,"Then he stationed all the troops with their weapons in hand surrounding the king—from the right side of the temple to the left side, by the altar and by the temple."
2 Chronicles,23,11,"They brought out the king’s son, put the crown on him, gave him the testimony, and made him king. Jehoiada and his sons anointed him and cried, “Long live the king!”"
2 Chronicles,23,12,"When Athaliah heard the noise from the troops, the guards, and those praising the king, she went to the troops in the LORD’s temple."
2 Chronicles,23,13,"As she looked, there was the king standing by his pillar at the entrance. The commanders and the trumpeters were by the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets while the singers with musical instruments were leading the praise. Athaliah tore her clothes and screamed, “Treason, treason!”"
2 Chronicles,23,14,"Then Jehoiada the priest sent out the commanders of hundreds, those in charge of the army, saying, “Take her out between the ranks, and put anyone who follows her to death by the sword,” for the priest had said, “Don’t put her to death in the LORD’s temple.”"
2 Chronicles,23,15,"So they arrested her, and she went by the entrance of the Horses’ Gate to the king’s palace, where they put her to death."
2 Chronicles,23,16,"Then Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, the king, and the people that they would be the LORD’s people."
2 Chronicles,23,17,"So all the people went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They broke its altars and images into pieces and killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, at the altars."
2 Chronicles,23,18,"Then Jehoiada put the oversight of the LORD’s temple into the hands of the Levitical priests, whom David had appointed over the LORD’s temple, to offer burnt offerings to the LORD as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and song ordained by David."
2 Chronicles,23,19,He stationed gatekeepers at the gates of the LORD’s temple so that nothing unclean could enter for any reason.
2 Chronicles,23,20,"Then he took with him the commanders of hundreds, the nobles, the governors of the people, and all the people of the land and brought the king down from the LORD’s temple. They entered the king’s palace through the Upper Gate and seated the king on the throne of the kingdom."
2 Chronicles,23,21,"All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet, for they had put Athaliah to death by the sword."
2 Chronicles,24,1,Joash was seven years old when he became king and reigned 40 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibiah; she was from Beer-sheba.
2 Chronicles,24,2,"Throughout the time of Jehoiada the priest, Joash did what was right in the LORD’s sight."
2 Chronicles,24,3,"Jehoiada acquired two wives for him, and he was the father of sons and daughters."
2 Chronicles,24,4,"Afterward, Joash took it to heart to renovate the LORD’s temple."
2 Chronicles,24,5,"So he gathered the priests and Levites and said, “Go out to the cities of Judah and collect money from all Israel to repair the temple of your God as needed year by year, and do it quickly.” However, the Levites did not hurry."
2 Chronicles,24,6,"So the king called Jehoiada the high priest and said, “Why haven’t you required the Levites to bring from Judah and Jerusalem the tax imposed by the LORD’s servant Moses and the assembly of Israel for the tent of the testimony?"
2 Chronicles,24,7,For the sons of that wicked Athaliah broke into the LORD’s temple and even used the sacred things of the LORD’s temple for the Baals.”
2 Chronicles,24,8,At the king’s command a chest was made and placed outside the gate of the LORD’s temple.
2 Chronicles,24,9,Then a proclamation was issued in Judah and Jerusalem that the tax God’s servant Moses imposed on Israel in the wilderness be brought to the LORD.
2 Chronicles,24,10,"All the leaders and all the people rejoiced, brought the tax, and put it in the chest until it was full."
2 Chronicles,24,11,"Whenever the chest was brought by the Levites to the king’s overseers, and when they saw that there was a large amount of money, the king’s secretary and the high priest’s deputy came and emptied the chest, picked it up, and returned it to its place. They did this daily and gathered the money in abundance."
2 Chronicles,24,12,"Then the king and Jehoiada gave it to those in charge of the labor on the LORD’s temple, who were hiring stonecutters and carpenters to renovate the LORD’s temple, also blacksmiths and coppersmiths to repair the LORD’s temple."
2 Chronicles,24,13,"The workmen did their work, and through them the repairs progressed. They restored God’s temple to its specifications and reinforced it."
2 Chronicles,24,14,"When they finished, they presented the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada, who made articles for the LORD’s temple with it—articles for ministry and for making burnt offerings, and ladles and articles of gold and silver. They regularly offered burnt offerings in the LORD’s temple throughout Jehoiada’s life."
2 Chronicles,24,15,Jehoiada died when he was old and full of days; he was 130 years old at his death.
2 Chronicles,24,16,He was buried in the city of David with the kings because he had done what was good in Israel with respect to God and His temple.
2 Chronicles,24,17,"However, after Jehoiada died, the rulers of Judah came and paid homage to the king. Then the king listened to them,"
2 Chronicles,24,18,"and they abandoned the temple of Yahweh, the God of their ancestors and served the Asherah poles and the idols. So there was wrath against Judah and Jerusalem for this guilt of theirs."
2 Chronicles,24,19,"Nevertheless, He sent them prophets to bring them back to the LORD; they admonished them, but the people would not listen."
2 Chronicles,24,20,"The Spirit of God took control of Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. He stood above the people and said to them, “This is what God says, ‘Why are you transgressing the LORD’s commands and you do not prosper? Because you have abandoned the LORD, He has abandoned you.’”"
2 Chronicles,24,21,But they conspired against him and stoned him at the king’s command in the courtyard of the LORD’s temple.
2 Chronicles,24,22,"King Joash didn’t remember the kindness that Zechariah’s father Jehoiada had extended to him, but killed his son. While he was dying, he said, “May the LORD see and demand an account.”"
2 Chronicles,24,23,"At the turn of the year, an Aramean army went to war against Joash. They entered Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the leaders of the people among them and sent all the plunder to the king of Damascus."
2 Chronicles,24,24,"Although the Aramean army came with only a few men, the LORD handed over a vast army to them because the people of Judah had abandoned Yahweh, the God of their ancestors. So they executed judgment on Joash."
2 Chronicles,24,25,"When the Arameans saw that Joash had many wounds, they left him. His servants conspired against him, and killed him on his bed, because he had shed the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest. So he died, and they buried him in the city of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings."
2 Chronicles,24,26,"Those who conspired against him were Zabad, son of the Ammonite woman Shimeath, and Jehozabad, son of the Moabite woman Shimrith."
2 Chronicles,24,27,"Concerning his sons, the many oracles about him, and the restoration of the LORD’s temple, they are recorded in the Writing of the Book of the Kings. His son Amaziah became king in his place."
2 Chronicles,25,1,Amaziah became king when he was 25 years old and reigned 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan; she was from Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,25,2,He did what was right in the LORD’s sight but not wholeheartedly.
2 Chronicles,25,3,"As soon as the kingdom was firmly in his grasp, he executed his servants who had murdered his father the king."
2 Chronicles,25,4,"However, he did not put their children to death, because—as it is written in the Law, in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded—“Fathers must not die because of children, and children must not die because of fathers, but each one will die for his own sin.”"
2 Chronicles,25,5,"Then Amaziah gathered Judah and assembled them according to ancestral house, according to commanders of thousands, and according to commanders of hundreds. He numbered those 20 years old or more for all Judah and Benjamin. He found there to be 300,000 choice men who could serve in the army, bearing spear and shield."
2 Chronicles,25,6,"Then for 7,500 pounds of silver he hired 100,000 brave warriors from Israel."
2 Chronicles,25,7,"However, a man of God came to him and said, “King, do not let Israel’s army go with you, for the LORD is not with Israel—all the Ephraimites."
2 Chronicles,25,8,"But if you go with them, do it! Be strong for battle! But God will make you stumble before the enemy, for God has the power to help or to make one stumble.”"
2 Chronicles,25,9,"Then Amaziah said to the man of God, “What should I do about the 7,500 pounds of silver I gave to Israel’s division?” The man of God replied, “The LORD is able to give you much more than this.”"
2 Chronicles,25,10,So Amaziah released the division that came to him from Ephraim to go home. But they got very angry with Judah and returned home in a fierce rage.
2 Chronicles,25,11,"Amaziah strengthened his position and led his people to the Valley of Salt. He struck down 10,000 Seirites,"
2 Chronicles,25,12,"and the Judahites captured 10,000 alive. They took them to the top of a cliff where they threw them off, and all of them were dashed to pieces."
2 Chronicles,25,13,"As for the men of the division that Amaziah sent back so they would not go with him into battle, they raided the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth-horon, struck down 3,000 of their people, and took a great deal of plunder."
2 Chronicles,25,14,"After Amaziah came from the attack on the Edomites, he brought the gods of the Seirites and set them up as his gods. He worshiped before them and burned incense to them."
2 Chronicles,25,15,"So the LORD’s anger was against Amaziah, and He sent a prophet to him, who said, “Why have you sought a people’s gods that could not deliver their own people from your hand?”"
2 Chronicles,25,16,"While he was still speaking to him, the king asked, “Have we made you the king’s counselor? Stop, why should you lose your life?” So the prophet stopped, but he said, “I know that God intends to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my advice.”"
2 Chronicles,25,17,"King Amaziah of Judah took counsel and sent word to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us meet face to face.”"
2 Chronicles,25,18,"King Jehoash of Israel sent word to King Amaziah of Judah, saying, “The thistle that was in Lebanon sent a message to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as a wife.’ Then a wild animal that was in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle."
2 Chronicles,25,19,"You have said, ‘Look, I have defeated Edom,’ and you have become overconfident that you will get glory. Now stay at home. Why stir up such trouble so that you fall and Judah with you?”"
2 Chronicles,25,20,"But Amaziah would not listen, for this turn of events was from God in order to hand them over to their enemies because they went after the gods of Edom."
2 Chronicles,25,21,So King Jehoash of Israel advanced. He and King Amaziah of Judah faced off at Beth-shemesh in Judah.
2 Chronicles,25,22,"Judah was routed before Israel, and each fled to his own tent."
2 Chronicles,25,23,"King Jehoash of Israel captured Judah’s King Amaziah son of Joash, son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh. Then Jehoash took him to Jerusalem and broke down 200 yards of Jerusalem’s wall from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate."
2 Chronicles,25,24,"He took all the gold, silver, all the utensils that were found with Obed-edom in God’s temple, the treasures of the king’s palace, and the hostages. Then he returned to Samaria."
2 Chronicles,25,25,Judah’s King Amaziah son of Joash lived 15 years after the death of Israel’s King Jehoash son of Jehoahaz.
2 Chronicles,25,26,"The rest of the events of Amaziah’s reign, from beginning to end, are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel."
2 Chronicles,25,27,"From the time Amaziah turned from following the LORD, a conspiracy was formed against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. However, men were sent after him to Lachish, and they put him to death there."
2 Chronicles,25,28,They carried him back on horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
2 Chronicles,26,1,"All the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was 16 years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah."
2 Chronicles,26,2,He rebuilt Eloth and restored it to Judah after Amaziah the king rested with his fathers.
2 Chronicles,26,3,Uzziah was 16 years old when he became king and reigned 52 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jecoliah from Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,26,4,He did what was right in the LORD’s sight as his father Amaziah had done.
2 Chronicles,26,5,"He sought God throughout the lifetime of Zechariah, the teacher of the fear of God. During the time that he sought the LORD, God gave him success."
2 Chronicles,26,6,"Uzziah went out to wage war against the Philistines, and he tore down the wall of Gath, the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod. Then he built cities in the vicinity of Ashdod and among the Philistines."
2 Chronicles,26,7,"God helped him against the Philistines, the Arabs that live in Gur-baal, and the Meunites."
2 Chronicles,26,8,"The Ammonites gave Uzziah tribute money, and his fame spread as far as the entrance of Egypt, for God made him very powerful."
2 Chronicles,26,9,"Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, the Valley Gate, and the corner buttress, and he fortified them."
2 Chronicles,26,10,"Since he had many cattle both in the Judean foothills and the plain, he built towers in the desert and dug many wells. And since he was a lover of the soil, he had farmers and vinedressers in the hills and in the fertile lands."
2 Chronicles,26,11,"Uzziah had an army equipped for combat that went out to war by division according to their assignments, as recorded by Jeiel the court secretary and Maaseiah the officer under the authority of Hananiah, one of the king’s commanders."
2 Chronicles,26,12,"The total number of heads of families was 2,600 brave warriors."
2 Chronicles,26,13,"Under their authority was an army of 307,500 equipped for combat, a powerful force to help the king against the enemy."
2 Chronicles,26,14,"Uzziah provided the entire army with shields, spears, helmets, armor, bows and slingstones."
2 Chronicles,26,15,"He made skillfully designed devices in Jerusalem to shoot arrows and catapult large stones for use on the towers and on the corners. So his fame spread even to distant places, for he was marvelously helped until he became strong."
2 Chronicles,26,16,"But when he became strong, he grew arrogant and it led to his own destruction. He acted unfaithfully against the LORD his God by going into the LORD’s sanctuary to burn incense on the incense altar."
2 Chronicles,26,17,"Azariah the priest, along with 80 brave priests of the LORD, went in after him."
2 Chronicles,26,18,"They took their stand against King Uzziah and said, “Uzziah, you have no right to offer incense to the LORD—only the consecrated priests, the descendants of Aaron, have the right to offer incense. Leave the sanctuary, for you have acted unfaithfully! You will not receive honor from the LORD God.”"
2 Chronicles,26,19,"Uzziah, with a firepan in his hand to offer incense, was enraged. But when he became enraged with the priests, in the presence of the priests in the LORD’s temple beside the altar of incense, a skin disease broke out on his forehead."
2 Chronicles,26,20,Then Azariah the chief priest and all the priests turned to him and saw that he was diseased on his forehead. They rushed him out of there. He himself also hurried to get out because the LORD had afflicted him.
2 Chronicles,26,21,"So King Uzziah was diseased to the time of his death. He lived in quarantine with a serious skin disease and was excluded from access to the LORD’s temple, while his son Jotham was over the king’s household governing the people of the land."
2 Chronicles,26,22,"Now the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz wrote about the rest of the events of Uzziah’s reign, from beginning to end."
2 Chronicles,26,23,"Uzziah rested with his fathers, and he was buried with his fathers in the burial ground of the kings’ cemetery, for they said, “He has a skin disease.” His son Jotham became king in his place."
2 Chronicles,27,1,Jotham was 25 years old when he became king and reigned 16 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerushah daughter of Zadok.
2 Chronicles,27,2,"He did what was right in the LORD’s sight as his father Uzziah had done. In addition, he didn’t enter the LORD’s sanctuary, but the people still behaved corruptly."
2 Chronicles,27,3,"Jotham built the Upper Gate of the LORD’s temple, and he built extensively on the wall of Ophel."
2 Chronicles,27,4,He also built cities in the hill country of Judah and fortresses and towers in the forests.
2 Chronicles,27,5,"He waged war against the king of the Ammonites. He overpowered the Ammonites, and that year they gave him 7,500 pounds of silver, 50,000 bushels of wheat, and 50,000 bushels of barley. They paid him the same in the second and third years."
2 Chronicles,27,6,So Jotham strengthened himself because he did not waver in obeying the LORD his God.
2 Chronicles,27,7,"As for the rest of the events of Jotham’s reign, along with all his wars and his ways, note that they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah."
2 Chronicles,27,8,He was 25 years old when he became king and reigned 16 years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,27,9,Jotham rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of David. His son Ahaz became king in his place.
2 Chronicles,28,1,"Ahaz was 20 years old when he became king and reigned 16 years in Jerusalem. He did not do what was right in the LORD’s sight like his ancestor David,"
2 Chronicles,28,2,for he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and made cast images of the Baals.
2 Chronicles,28,3,"He burned incense in the Valley of Hinnom and burned his children in the fire, imitating the detestable practices of the nations the LORD had dispossessed before the Israelites."
2 Chronicles,28,4,"He sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree."
2 Chronicles,28,5,"So the LORD his God handed Ahaz over to the king of Aram. He attacked him and took many captives to Damascus. Ahaz was also handed over to the king of Israel, who struck him with great force:"
2 Chronicles,28,6,"Pekah son of Remaliah killed 120,000 in Judah in one day—all brave men—because they had abandoned the LORD God of their ancestors."
2 Chronicles,28,7,"An Ephraimite warrior named Zichri killed the king’s son Maaseiah, Azrikam governor of the palace, and Elkanah who was second to the king."
2 Chronicles,28,8,"Then the Israelites took 200,000 captives from their brothers—women, sons, and daughters. They also took a great deal of plunder from them and brought it to Samaria."
2 Chronicles,28,9,"A prophet of the LORD named Oded was there. He went out to meet the army that came to Samaria and said to them, “Look, the LORD God of your ancestors handed them over to you because of His wrath against Judah, but you slaughtered them in a rage that has reached heaven."
2 Chronicles,28,10,"Now you plan to reduce the people of Judah and Jerusalem, male and female, to slavery. Are you not also guilty before Yahweh your God?"
2 Chronicles,28,11,"Listen to me and return the captives you took from your brothers, for the LORD’s burning anger is on you.”"
2 Chronicles,28,12,"So some men who were leaders of the Ephraimites—Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai—stood in opposition to those coming from the war."
2 Chronicles,28,13,"They said to them, “You must not bring the captives here, for you plan to bring guilt on us from the LORD to add to our sins and our guilt. For we have much guilt, and burning anger is on Israel.”"
2 Chronicles,28,14,The army left the captives and the plunder in the presence of the officers and the congregation.
2 Chronicles,28,15,"Then the men who were designated by name took charge of the captives and provided clothes for their naked ones from the plunder. They clothed them, gave them sandals, food and drink, dressed their wounds, and provided donkeys for all the feeble. The Israelites brought them to Jericho, the City of Palms, among their brothers. Then they returned to Samaria."
2 Chronicles,28,16,At that time King Ahaz asked the king of Assyria for help.
2 Chronicles,28,17,"The Edomites came again, attacked Judah, and took captives."
2 Chronicles,28,18,"The Philistines also raided the cities of the Judean foothills and the Negev of Judah and captured Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco and its villages, Timnah and its villages, Gimzo and its villages, and they lived there."
2 Chronicles,28,19,"For the LORD humbled Judah because of King Ahaz of Judah, who threw off restraint in Judah and was unfaithful to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,28,20,Then Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came against Ahaz; he oppressed him and did not give him support.
2 Chronicles,28,21,"Although Ahaz plundered the LORD’s temple and the palace of the king and of the rulers and gave the plunder to the king of Assyria, it did not help him."
2 Chronicles,28,22,"At the time of his distress, King Ahaz himself became more unfaithful to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,28,23,"He sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which had defeated him; he said, “Since the gods of the kings of Aram are helping them, I will sacrifice to them so that they will help me.” But they were the downfall of him and of all Israel."
2 Chronicles,28,24,"Then Ahaz gathered up the utensils of God’s temple, cut them into pieces, shut the doors of the LORD’s temple, and made himself altars on every street corner in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,28,25,"He made high places in every city of Judah to offer incense to other gods, and he provoked the LORD, the God of his ancestors."
2 Chronicles,28,26,"As for the rest of his deeds and all his ways, from beginning to end, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel."
2 Chronicles,28,27,"Ahaz rested with his fathers and was buried in the city, in Jerusalem, but they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. His son Hezekiah became king in his place."
2 Chronicles,29,1,Hezekiah was 25 years old when he became king and reigned 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abijah daughter of Zechariah.
2 Chronicles,29,2,He did what was right in the LORD’s sight just as his ancestor David had done.
2 Chronicles,29,3,"In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the LORD’s temple and repaired them."
2 Chronicles,29,4,Then he brought in the priests and Levites and gathered them in the eastern public square.
2 Chronicles,29,5,"He said to them, “Hear me, Levites. Consecrate yourselves now and consecrate the temple of Yahweh, the God of your ancestors. Remove everything impure from the holy place."
2 Chronicles,29,6,"For our fathers were unfaithful and did what is evil in the sight of the LORD our God. They abandoned Him, turned their faces away from the LORD’s tabernacle, and turned their backs on Him."
2 Chronicles,29,7,"They also closed the doors of the portico, extinguished the lamps, did not burn incense, and did not offer burnt offerings in the holy place of the God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,29,8,"Therefore, the wrath of the LORD was on Judah and Jerusalem, and He made them an object of terror, horror, and mockery, as you see with your own eyes."
2 Chronicles,29,9,"Our fathers fell by the sword, and our sons, our daughters, and our wives are in captivity because of this."
2 Chronicles,29,10,"It is in my heart now to make a covenant with Yahweh, the God of Israel so that His burning anger may turn away from us."
2 Chronicles,29,11,"My sons, don’t be negligent now, for the LORD has chosen you to stand in His presence, to serve Him, and to be His ministers and burners of incense.”"
2 Chronicles,29,12,Then the Levites stood up: Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah from the Kohathites; Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel from the Merarites; Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah from the Gershonites;
2 Chronicles,29,13,Shimri and Jeuel from the Elizaphanites; Zechariah and Mattaniah from the Asaphites;
2 Chronicles,29,14,Jehiel and Shimei from the Hemanites; Shemaiah and Uzziel from the Jeduthunites.
2 Chronicles,29,15,"They gathered their brothers together, consecrated themselves, and went according to the king’s command by the words of the LORD to cleanse the LORD’s temple."
2 Chronicles,29,16,The priests went to the entrance of the LORD’s temple to cleanse it. They took all the unclean things they found in the LORD’s sanctuary to the courtyard of the LORD’s temple. Then the Levites received them and took them outside to the Kidron Valley.
2 Chronicles,29,17,"They began the consecration on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the portico of the LORD’s temple. They consecrated the LORD’s temple for eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished."
2 Chronicles,29,18,"Then they went inside to King Hezekiah and said, “We have cleansed the whole temple of the LORD, the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the table for the rows of the bread of the Presence and all its utensils."
2 Chronicles,29,19,We have set up and consecrated all the utensils that King Ahaz rejected during his reign when he became unfaithful. They are in front of the altar of the LORD.”
2 Chronicles,29,20,"King Hezekiah got up early, gathered the city officials, and went to the LORD’s temple."
2 Chronicles,29,21,"They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. Then he told the descendants of Aaron, the priests, to offer them on the altar of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,29,22,"So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests received the blood and sprinkled it on the altar. They slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar. They slaughtered the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar."
2 Chronicles,29,23,"Then they brought the goats for the sin offering right into the presence of the king and the congregation, who laid their hands on them."
2 Chronicles,29,24,"The priests slaughtered the goats and put their blood on the altar for a sin offering, to make atonement for all Israel, for the king said that the burnt offering and sin offering were for all Israel."
2 Chronicles,29,25,"Hezekiah stationed the Levites in the LORD’s temple with cymbals, harps, and lyres according to the command of David, Gad the king’s seer, and Nathan the prophet. For the command was from the LORD through His prophets."
2 Chronicles,29,26,"The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets."
2 Chronicles,29,27,"Then Hezekiah ordered that the burnt offering be offered on the altar. When the burnt offerings began, the song of the LORD and the trumpets began, accompanied by the instruments of David king of Israel."
2 Chronicles,29,28,"The whole assembly was worshiping, singing the song, and blowing the trumpets—all of this continued until the burnt offering was completed."
2 Chronicles,29,29,"When the burnt offerings were completed, the king and all those present with him bowed down and worshiped."
2 Chronicles,29,30,Then King Hezekiah and the officials told the Levites to sing praise to the LORD in the words of David and of Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with rejoicing and bowed down and worshiped.
2 Chronicles,29,31,"Hezekiah concluded, “Now you are consecrated to the LORD. Come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the LORD’s temple.” So the congregation brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all those with willing hearts brought burnt offerings."
2 Chronicles,29,32,"The number of burnt offerings the congregation brought was 70 bulls, 100 rams, and 200 lambs; all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,29,33,"Six hundred bulls and 3,000 sheep were consecrated."
2 Chronicles,29,34,"However, since there were not enough priests, they weren’t able to skin all the burnt offerings, so their Levite brothers helped them until the work was finished and until the priests consecrated themselves. For the Levites were more conscientious to consecrate themselves than the priests were."
2 Chronicles,29,35,"Furthermore, the burnt offerings were abundant, along with the fat of the fellowship offerings and with the drink offerings for the burnt offering. So the service of the LORD’s temple was established."
2 Chronicles,29,36,"Then Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced over how God had prepared the people, for it had come about suddenly."
2 Chronicles,30,1,"Then Hezekiah sent word throughout all Israel and Judah, and he also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh to come to the LORD’s temple in Jerusalem to observe the Passover of Yahweh, the God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,30,2,"For the king and his officials and the entire congregation in Jerusalem decided to observe the Passover of the LORD in the second month,"
2 Chronicles,30,3,because they were not able to observe it at the appropriate time. Not enough of the priests had consecrated themselves and the people hadn’t been gathered together in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,30,4,"The proposal pleased the king and the congregation,"
2 Chronicles,30,5,"so they affirmed the proposal and spread the message throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba to Dan, to come to observe the Passover of Yahweh, the God of Israel in Jerusalem, for they hadn’t observed it often, as prescribed."
2 Chronicles,30,6,"So the couriers went throughout Israel and Judah with letters from the hand of the king and his officials, and according to the king’s command, saying, “Israelites, return to Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel so that He may return to those of you who remain, who have escaped from the grasp of the kings of Assyria."
2 Chronicles,30,7,"Don’t be like your fathers and your brothers who were unfaithful to Yahweh, the God of their ancestors so that He made them an object of horror as you yourselves see."
2 Chronicles,30,8,"Don’t become obstinate now like your fathers did. Give your allegiance to Yahweh, and come to His sanctuary that He has consecrated forever. Serve the LORD your God so that He may turn His burning anger away from you,"
2 Chronicles,30,9,"for when you return to Yahweh, your brothers and your sons will receive mercy in the presence of their captors and will return to this land. For Yahweh your God is gracious and merciful; He will not turn His face away from you if you return to Him.”"
2 Chronicles,30,10,"The couriers traveled from city to city in the land of Ephraim and Manasseh as far as Zebulun, but the inhabitants laughed at them and mocked them."
2 Chronicles,30,11,"But some from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,30,12,"Also, the power of God was at work in Judah to unite them to carry out the command of the king and his officials by the word of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,30,13,A very large assembly of people was gathered in Jerusalem to observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread in the second month.
2 Chronicles,30,14,"They proceeded to take away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and they took away the incense altars and threw them into the Kidron Valley."
2 Chronicles,30,15,"They slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and Levites were ashamed, and they consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the LORD’s temple."
2 Chronicles,30,16,"They stood at their prescribed posts, according to the law of Moses, the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood received from the hand of the Levites,"
2 Chronicles,30,17,"for there were many in the assembly who had not consecrated themselves, and so the Levites were in charge of slaughtering the Passover lambs for every unclean person to consecrate the lambs to the LORD."
2 Chronicles,30,18,"A large number of the people—many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun—were ritually unclean, yet they had eaten the Passover contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah had interceded for them, saying, “May the good LORD provide atonement on behalf of"
2 Chronicles,30,19,"whoever sets his whole heart on seeking God, Yahweh, the God of his ancestors, even though not according to the purification rules of the sanctuary.”"
2 Chronicles,30,20,So the LORD heard Hezekiah and healed the people.
2 Chronicles,30,21,"The Israelites who were present in Jerusalem observed the Festival of Unleavened Bread seven days with great joy, and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day after day with loud instruments."
2 Chronicles,30,22,"Then Hezekiah encouraged all the Levites who performed skillfully before the LORD. They ate at the appointed festival for seven days, sacrificing fellowship offerings and giving thanks to Yahweh, the God of their ancestors."
2 Chronicles,30,23,"The whole congregation decided to observe seven more days, so they observed seven days with joy,"
2 Chronicles,30,24,"for Hezekiah king of Judah contributed 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep for the congregation. Also, the officials contributed 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep for the congregation, and many priests consecrated themselves."
2 Chronicles,30,25,"Then the whole assembly of Judah with the priests and Levites, the whole assembly that came from Israel, the foreigners who came from the land of Israel, and those who were living in Judah, rejoiced."
2 Chronicles,30,26,"There was great rejoicing in Jerusalem, for nothing like this was known since the days of Solomon son of David, the king of Israel."
2 Chronicles,30,27,"Then the priests and the Levites stood to bless the people, and God heard their voice, and their prayer came into His holy dwelling place in heaven."
2 Chronicles,31,1,"When all this was completed, all Israel who had attended went out to the cities of Judah and broke up the sacred pillars, chopped down the Asherah poles, and tore down the high places and altars throughout Judah and Benjamin, as well as in Ephraim and Manasseh, to the last one. Then all the Israelites returned to their cities, each to his own possession."
2 Chronicles,31,2,"Hezekiah reestablished the divisions of the priests and Levites for the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, for ministry, for giving thanks, and for praise in the gates of the camp of the LORD, each division corresponding to his service among the priests and Levites."
2 Chronicles,31,3,"The king contributed from his own possessions for the regular morning and evening burnt offerings, the burnt offerings of the Sabbaths, of the New Moons, and of the appointed feasts, as written in the law of the LORD."
2 Chronicles,31,4,He told the people who lived in Jerusalem to give a contribution for the priests and Levites so that they could devote their energy to the law of the LORD.
2 Chronicles,31,5,"When the word spread, the Israelites gave liberally of the best of the grain, new wine, oil, honey, and of all the produce of the field, and they brought in an abundance, a tenth of everything."
2 Chronicles,31,6,"As for the Israelites and Judahites who lived in the cities of Judah, they also brought a tenth of the cattle and sheep, and a tenth of the dedicated things that were consecrated to the LORD their God. They gathered them into large piles."
2 Chronicles,31,7,"In the third month they began building up the piles, and they finished in the seventh month."
2 Chronicles,31,8,"When Hezekiah and his officials came and viewed the piles, they praised the LORD and His people Israel."
2 Chronicles,31,9,Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the piles.
2 Chronicles,31,10,"Azariah, the chief priest of the household of Zadok, answered him, “Since they began bringing the offering to the LORD’s temple, we eat and are satisfied and there is plenty left over because the LORD has blessed His people; this abundance is what is left over.”"
2 Chronicles,31,11,"Hezekiah told them to prepare chambers in the LORD’s temple, and they prepared them."
2 Chronicles,31,12,"The offering, the tenth, and the dedicated things were brought faithfully. Conaniah the Levite was the officer in charge of them, and his brother Shimei was second."
2 Chronicles,31,13,"Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were deputies under the authority of Conaniah and his brother Shimei by appointment of King Hezekiah and of Azariah the chief official of God’s temple."
2 Chronicles,31,14,"Kore son of Imnah the Levite, the keeper of the East Gate, was over the freewill offerings to God to distribute the contribution to the LORD and the consecrated things."
2 Chronicles,31,15,"Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah in the cities of the priests were to faithfully distribute it under his authority to their brothers by divisions, whether large or small."
2 Chronicles,31,16,"In addition, they distributed it to males registered by genealogy three years old and above; to all who would enter the LORD’s temple for their daily duty, for their service in their responsibilities according to their divisions."
2 Chronicles,31,17,"They distributed also to those recorded by genealogy of the priests by their ancestral families and the Levites 20 years old and above, by their responsibilities in their divisions;"
2 Chronicles,31,18,"to those registered by genealogy—with all their infants, wives, sons, and daughters—of the whole assembly (for they had faithfully consecrated themselves as holy);"
2 Chronicles,31,19,"and to the descendants of Aaron, the priests, in the common fields of their cities, in each and every city. There were men who were registered by name to distribute a portion to every male among the priests and to every Levite recorded by genealogy."
2 Chronicles,31,20,Hezekiah did this throughout all Judah. He did what was good and upright and true before the LORD his God.
2 Chronicles,31,21,"He was diligent in every deed that he began in the service of God’s temple, in the instruction and the commands, in order to seek his God, and he prospered."
2 Chronicles,32,1,"After these faithful deeds, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and entered Judah. He laid siege to the fortified cities and intended to break into them."
2 Chronicles,32,2,"Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that he planned war on Jerusalem,"
2 Chronicles,32,3,"so he consulted with his officials and his warriors about stopping up the waters of the springs that were outside the city, and they helped him."
2 Chronicles,32,4,"Many people gathered and stopped up all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land; they said, “Why should the kings of Assyria come and find plenty of water?”"
2 Chronicles,32,5,"Then Hezekiah strengthened his position by rebuilding the entire broken-down wall and heightening the towers and the other outside wall. He repaired the supporting terraces of the city of David, and made an abundance of weapons and shields."
2 Chronicles,32,6,"He set military commanders over the people and gathered the people in the square of the city gate. Then he encouraged them, saying,"
2 Chronicles,32,7,"“Be strong and courageous! Don’t be afraid or discouraged before the king of Assyria or before the large army that is with him, for there are more with us than with him."
2 Chronicles,32,8,"He has only human strength, but we have Yahweh our God to help us and to fight our battles.” So the people relied on the words of King Hezekiah of Judah."
2 Chronicles,32,9,"After this, while Sennacherib king of Assyria with all his armed forces besieged Lachish, he sent his servants to Jerusalem against King Hezekiah of Judah and against all those of Judah who were in Jerusalem, saying,"
2 Chronicles,32,10,“This is what King Sennacherib of Assyria says: ‘What are you relying on that you remain in Jerusalem under siege?
2 Chronicles,32,11,"Isn’t Hezekiah misleading you to give you over to death by famine and thirst when he says, “Yahweh our God will deliver us from the power of the king of Assyria”?"
2 Chronicles,32,12,"Didn’t Hezekiah himself remove His high places and His altars and say to Judah and Jerusalem, “You must worship before one altar, and you must burn incense on it”?"
2 Chronicles,32,13,“‘Don’t you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Have any of the national gods of the lands been able to deliver their land from my power?
2 Chronicles,32,14,"Who among all the gods of these nations that my predecessors completely destroyed was able to deliver his people from my power, that your God should be able to do the same for you?"
2 Chronicles,32,15,"So now, don’t let Hezekiah deceive you, and don’t let him mislead you like this. Don’t believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my power or the power of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you from my power!’”"
2 Chronicles,32,16,His servants said more against the LORD God and against His servant Hezekiah.
2 Chronicles,32,17,"He also wrote letters to mock Yahweh, the God of Israel, saying against Him: Just like the national gods of the lands that did not deliver their people from my power, so Hezekiah’s God will not deliver His people from my power."
2 Chronicles,32,18,"Then they called out loudly in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem, who were on the wall, to frighten and discourage them in order that he might capture the city."
2 Chronicles,32,19,"They spoke against the God of Jerusalem like they had spoken against the gods of the peoples of the earth, which were made by human hands."
2 Chronicles,32,20,"King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz prayed about this and cried out to heaven,"
2 Chronicles,32,21,"and the LORD sent an angel who annihilated every brave warrior, leader, and commander in the camp of the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria returned in disgrace to his land. He went to the temple of his god, and there some of his own children struck him down with the sword."
2 Chronicles,32,22,So the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the power of King Sennacherib of Assyria and from the power of all others. He gave them rest on every side.
2 Chronicles,32,23,"Many were bringing an offering to the LORD to Jerusalem and valuable gifts to King Hezekiah of Judah, and he was exalted in the eyes of all the nations after that."
2 Chronicles,32,24,"In those days Hezekiah became sick to the point of death, so he prayed to the LORD, and He spoke to him and gave him a miraculous sign."
2 Chronicles,32,25,"However, because his heart was proud, Hezekiah didn’t respond according to the benefit that had come to him. So there was wrath on him, Judah, and Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,32,26,Then Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart—he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem—so the LORD’s wrath didn’t come on them during Hezekiah’s lifetime.
2 Chronicles,32,27,"Hezekiah had abundant riches and glory, and he made himself treasuries for silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and every desirable item."
2 Chronicles,32,28,"He made warehouses for the harvest of grain, new wine, and oil, and stalls for all kinds of cattle, and pens for flocks."
2 Chronicles,32,29,"He made cities for himself, and he acquired herds of sheep and cattle in abundance, for God gave him abundant possessions."
2 Chronicles,32,30,This same Hezekiah blocked the outlet of the water of the Upper Gihon and channeled it smoothly downward and westward to the city of David. Hezekiah succeeded in everything he did.
2 Chronicles,32,31,"When the ambassadors of Babylon’s rulers were sent to him to inquire about the miraculous sign that happened in the land, God left him to test him and discover what was in his heart."
2 Chronicles,32,32,"As for the rest of the events of Hezekiah’s reign and his deeds of faithful love, note that they are written in the Visions of the Prophet Isaiah son of Amoz, and in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel."
2 Chronicles,32,33,Hezekiah rested with his fathers and was buried on the ascent to the tombs of David’s descendants. All Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem paid him honor at his death. His son Manasseh became king in his place.
2 Chronicles,33,1,Manasseh was 12 years old when he became king and reigned 55 years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,33,2,"He did what was evil in the LORD’s sight, imitating the detestable practices of the nations that the LORD had dispossessed before the Israelites."
2 Chronicles,33,3,"He rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had torn down and reestablished the altars for the Baals. He made Asherah poles, and he worshiped the whole heavenly host and served them."
2 Chronicles,33,4,"He built altars in the LORD’s temple, where Yahweh had said, “Jerusalem is where My name will remain forever.”"
2 Chronicles,33,5,He built altars to the whole heavenly host in both courtyards of the LORD’s temple.
2 Chronicles,33,6,"He passed his sons through the fire in the Valley of Hinnom. He practiced witchcraft, divination, and sorcery, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did a great deal of evil in the LORD’s sight, provoking Him."
2 Chronicles,33,7,"Manasseh set up a carved image of the idol he had made, in God’s temple, about which God had said to David and his son Solomon, “I will establish My name forever in this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel."
2 Chronicles,33,8,"I will never again remove the feet of the Israelites from the land where I stationed your ancestors, if only they will be careful to do all that I have commanded them through Moses—all the law, statutes, and judgments.”"
2 Chronicles,33,9,So Manasseh caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to stray so that they did worse evil than the nations the LORD had destroyed before the Israelites.
2 Chronicles,33,10,"The LORD spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they didn’t listen."
2 Chronicles,33,11,"So He brought against them the military commanders of the king of Assyria. They captured Manasseh with hooks, bound him with bronze shackles, and took him to Babylon."
2 Chronicles,33,12,"When he was in distress, he sought the favor of Yahweh his God and earnestly humbled himself before the God of his ancestors."
2 Chronicles,33,13,"He prayed to Him, so He heard his petition and granted his request, and brought him back to Jerusalem, to his kingdom. So Manasseh came to know that Yahweh is God."
2 Chronicles,33,14,"After this, he built the outer wall of the city of David from west of Gihon in the valley to the entrance of the Fish Gate; he brought it around the Ophel, and he heightened it considerably. He also placed military commanders in all the fortified cities of Judah."
2 Chronicles,33,15,"He removed the foreign gods and the idol from the LORD’s temple, along with all the altars that he had built on the mountain of the LORD’s temple and in Jerusalem, and he threw them outside the city."
2 Chronicles,33,16,"He built the altar of the LORD and offered fellowship and thank offerings on it. Then he told Judah to serve Yahweh, the God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,33,17,"However, the people still sacrificed at the high places, but only to Yahweh their God."
2 Chronicles,33,18,"The rest of the events of Manasseh’s reign, along with his prayer to his God and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, are written in the Records of Israel’s Kings."
2 Chronicles,33,19,"His prayer and how God granted his request, and all his sin and unfaithfulness and the sites where he built high places and set up Asherah poles and carved images before he humbled himself, they are written in the Records of Hozai."
2 Chronicles,33,20,"Manasseh rested with his fathers, and he was buried in his own house. His son Amon became king in his place."
2 Chronicles,33,21,Amon was 22 years old when he became king and reigned two years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,33,22,"He did what was evil in the LORD’s sight just as his father Manasseh had done. Amon sacrificed to all the carved images that his father Manasseh had made, and he served them."
2 Chronicles,33,23,"But he did not humble himself before the LORD like his father Manasseh humbled himself; instead, Amon increased his guilt."
2 Chronicles,33,24,So his servants conspired against him and put him to death in his own house.
2 Chronicles,33,25,Then the common people executed all those who conspired against King Amon and made his son Josiah king in his place.
2 Chronicles,34,1,Josiah was eight years old when he became king and reigned 31 years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,34,2,He did what was right in the LORD’s sight and walked in the ways of his ancestor David; he did not turn aside to the right or the left.
2 Chronicles,34,3,"In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still a youth, Josiah began to seek the God of his ancestor David, and in the twelfth year he began to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the Asherah poles, the carved images, and the cast images."
2 Chronicles,34,4,"Then in his presence the altars of the Baals were torn down, and he chopped down the incense altars that were above them. He shattered the Asherah poles, the carved images, and the cast images, crushed them to dust, and scattered them over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them."
2 Chronicles,34,5,He burned the bones of the priests on their altars. So he cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,34,6,"He did the same in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, and as far as Naphtali and on their surrounding mountain shrines."
2 Chronicles,34,7,"He tore down the altars, and he smashed the Asherah poles and the carved images to powder. He chopped down all the incense altars throughout the land of Israel and returned to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,34,8,"In the eighteenth year of his reign, in order to cleanse the land and the temple, Josiah sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, along with Maaseiah the governor of the city and the court historian Joah son of Joahaz, to repair the temple of the LORD his God."
2 Chronicles,34,9,"So they went to Hilkiah the high priest, and gave him the money brought into God’s temple. The Levites and the doorkeepers had collected money from Manasseh, Ephraim, and from the entire remnant of Israel, and from all Judah, Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,34,10,"They put it into the hands of those doing the work—those who oversaw the LORD’s temple. They gave it to the workmen who were working in the LORD’s temple, to repair and restore the temple;"
2 Chronicles,34,11,they gave it to the carpenters and builders and also used it to buy quarried stone and timbers—for joining and making beams—for the buildings that Judah’s kings had destroyed.
2 Chronicles,34,12,"The men were doing the work with integrity. Their overseers were Jahath and Obadiah, Levites from the Merarites, and Zechariah and Meshullam from the Kohathites as supervisors. The Levites were all skilled with musical instruments."
2 Chronicles,34,13,"They were also over the porters and were supervising all those doing the work task by task. Some of the Levites were secretaries, officers, and gatekeepers."
2 Chronicles,34,14,"When they brought out the money that had been deposited in the LORD’s temple, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of the LORD written by the hand of Moses."
2 Chronicles,34,15,"Consequently, Hilkiah told Shaphan the court secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the LORD’s temple,” and he gave the book to Shaphan."
2 Chronicles,34,16,"Shaphan took the book to the king, and also reported, “Your servants are doing all that was placed in their hands."
2 Chronicles,34,17,They have emptied out the money that was found in the LORD’s temple and have put it into the hand of the overseers and the hand of those doing the work.”
2 Chronicles,34,18,"Then Shaphan the court secretary told the king, “Hilkiah the priest gave me a book,” and Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king."
2 Chronicles,34,19,"When the king heard the words of the law, he tore his clothes."
2 Chronicles,34,20,"Then he commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of Micah, Shaphan the court secretary, and the king’s servant Asaiah,"
2 Chronicles,34,21,"“Go. Ask Yahweh for me and for those remaining in Israel and Judah, concerning the words of the book that was found. For great is the LORD’s wrath that is poured out on us because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD in order to do everything written in this book.”"
2 Chronicles,34,22,"So Hilkiah and those the king had designated went to the prophetess Huldah, the wife of Shallum son of Tokhath, son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem in the Second District. They spoke with her about this."
2 Chronicles,34,23,"She said to them, “This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel says: Say to the man who sent you to Me,"
2 Chronicles,34,24,"‘This is what Yahweh says: I am about to bring disaster on this place and on its inhabitants, fulfilling all the curses written in the book that they read in the presence of the king of Judah,"
2 Chronicles,34,25,"because they have abandoned Me and burned incense to other gods in order to provoke Me with all the works of their hands. My wrath will be poured out on this place, and it will not be quenched.’"
2 Chronicles,34,26,"Say this to the king of Judah who sent you to ask Yahweh, ‘This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel says: As for the words that you heard,"
2 Chronicles,34,27,"because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before God when you heard His words against this place and against its inhabitants, and because you humbled yourself before Me, and you tore your clothes and wept before Me, I Myself have heard’—this is the LORD’s declaration."
2 Chronicles,34,28,"‘I will indeed gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster that I am bringing on this place and on its inhabitants.’” Then they reported to the king."
2 Chronicles,34,29,So the king sent messengers and gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,34,30,"The king went up to the LORD’s temple with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, as well as the priests and the Levites—all the people from great to small. He read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the LORD’s temple."
2 Chronicles,34,31,"Then the king stood at his post and made a covenant in the LORD’s presence to follow the LORD and to keep His commands, His decrees, and His statutes with all his heart and with all his soul in order to carry out the words of the covenant written in this book."
2 Chronicles,34,32,"He had all those present in Jerusalem and Benjamin agree to it. So all the inhabitants of Jerusalem carried out the covenant of God, the God of their ancestors."
2 Chronicles,34,33,"So Josiah removed everything that was detestable from all the lands belonging to the Israelites, and he required all who were present in Israel to serve the LORD their God. Throughout his reign they did not turn aside from following Yahweh, the God of their ancestors."
2 Chronicles,35,1,Josiah observed the LORD’s Passover and slaughtered the Passover lambs on the fourteenth day of the first month.
2 Chronicles,35,2,He appointed the priests to their responsibilities and encouraged them to serve in the LORD’s temple.
2 Chronicles,35,3,"He said to the Levites who taught all Israel the holy things of the LORD, “Put the holy ark in the temple built by Solomon son of David king of Israel. Since you do not have to carry it on your shoulders, now serve Yahweh your God and His people Israel."
2 Chronicles,35,4,“Organize your ancestral houses by your divisions according to the written instruction of David king of Israel and that of his son Solomon.
2 Chronicles,35,5,"Serve in the holy place by the divisions of the ancestral houses for your brothers, the lay people, and the distribution of the tribal household of the Levites."
2 Chronicles,35,6,"Slaughter the Passover lambs, consecrate yourselves, and make preparations for your brothers to carry out the word of the LORD through Moses.”"
2 Chronicles,35,7,"Then Josiah donated 30,000 sheep, lambs, and young goats, plus 3,000 bulls from his own possessions, for the Passover sacrifices for all the lay people who were present."
2 Chronicles,35,8,"His officials also donated willingly for the people, the priests, and the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, chief officials of God’s temple, gave 2,600 Passover sacrifices and 300 bulls for the priests."
2 Chronicles,35,9,"Conaniah and his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, and Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, officers of the Levites, donated 5,000 Passover sacrifices for the Levites, plus 500 bulls."
2 Chronicles,35,10,So the service was established; the priests stood at their posts and the Levites in their divisions according to the king’s command.
2 Chronicles,35,11,"Then they slaughtered the Passover lambs, and while the Levites were skinning the animals, the priests sprinkled the blood they had been given."
2 Chronicles,35,12,"They removed the burnt offerings so that they might be given to the divisions of the ancestral houses of the lay people to offer to the LORD, according to what is written in the book of Moses; they did the same with the bulls."
2 Chronicles,35,13,"They roasted the Passover lambs with fire according to regulation. They boiled the holy sacrifices in pots, kettles, and bowls; and they quickly brought them to the lay people."
2 Chronicles,35,14,"Afterward, they made preparations for themselves and for the priests, since the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were busy offering up burnt offerings and fat until night. So the Levites made preparations for themselves and for the priests, the descendants of Aaron."
2 Chronicles,35,15,"The singers, the descendants of Asaph, were at their stations according to the command of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer. Also, the gatekeepers were at each gate. None of them left their tasks because their Levite brothers had made preparations for them."
2 Chronicles,35,16,"So all the service of the LORD was established that day for observing the Passover and for offering burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD, according to the command of King Josiah."
2 Chronicles,35,17,The Israelites who were present in Judah also observed the Passover at that time and the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days.
2 Chronicles,35,18,"No Passover had been observed like it in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet. None of the kings of Israel ever observed a Passover like the one that Josiah observed with the priests, the Levites, all Judah, the Israelites who were present in Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,35,19,"In the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign, this Passover was observed."
2 Chronicles,35,20,"After all this that Josiah had prepared for the temple, Neco king of Egypt marched up to fight at Carchemish by the Euphrates, and Josiah went out to confront him."
2 Chronicles,35,21,"But Neco sent messengers to him, saying, “What is the issue between you and me, king of Judah? I have not come against you today but I am fighting another dynasty. God told me to hurry. Stop opposing God who is with me; don’t make Him destroy you!”"
2 Chronicles,35,22,"But Josiah did not turn away from him; instead, in order to fight with him he disguised himself. He did not listen to Neco’s words from the mouth of God, but went to the Valley of Megiddo to fight."
2 Chronicles,35,23,"The archers shot King Josiah, and he said to his servants, “Take me away, for I am severely wounded!”"
2 Chronicles,35,24,"So his servants took him out of the war chariot, carried him in his second chariot, and brought him to Jerusalem. Then he died, and they buried him in the tomb of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah."
2 Chronicles,35,25,"Jeremiah chanted a dirge over Josiah, and all the singing men and singing women still speak of Josiah in their dirges to this very day. They established them as a statute for Israel, and indeed they are written in the Dirges."
2 Chronicles,35,26,"The rest of the events of Josiah’s reign, along with his deeds of faithful love according to what is written in the law of the LORD,"
2 Chronicles,35,27,"and his words, from beginning to end, are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah."
2 Chronicles,36,1,Then the common people took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and made him king in Jerusalem in place of his father.
2 Chronicles,36,2,Jehoahaz was 23 years old when he became king and reigned three months in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,36,3,"The king of Egypt deposed him in Jerusalem and fined the land 7,500 pounds of silver and 75 pounds of gold."
2 Chronicles,36,4,Then Neco king of Egypt made Jehoahaz’s brother Eliakim king over Judah and Jerusalem and changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took his brother Jehoahaz and brought him to Egypt.
2 Chronicles,36,5,Jehoiakim was 25 years old when he became king and reigned 11 years in Jerusalem. He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.
2 Chronicles,36,6,Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked him and bound him in bronze shackles to take him to Babylon.
2 Chronicles,36,7,Also Nebuchadnezzar took some of the utensils of the LORD’s temple to Babylon and put them in his temple in Babylon.
2 Chronicles,36,8,"The rest of the deeds of Jehoiakim, the detestable things he did, and what was found against him, are written in the Book of Israel’s Kings. His son Jehoiachin became king in his place."
2 Chronicles,36,9,Jehoiachin was 18 years old when he became king and reigned three months and 10 days in Jerusalem. He did what was evil in the LORD’s sight.
2 Chronicles,36,10,In the spring Nebuchadnezzar sent for him and brought him to Babylon along with the valuable utensils of the LORD’s temple. Then he made Jehoiachin’s brother Zedekiah king over Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,36,11,Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king and reigned 11 years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles,36,12,He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD his God and did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet at the LORD’s command.
2 Chronicles,36,13,"He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar who had made him swear allegiance by God. He became obstinate and hardened his heart against returning to Yahweh, the God of Israel."
2 Chronicles,36,14,"All the leaders of the priests and the people multiplied their unfaithful deeds, imitating all the detestable practices of the nations, and they defiled the LORD’s temple that He had consecrated in Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles,36,15,"But Yahweh, the God of their ancestors sent word against them by the hand of His messengers, sending them time and time again, for He had compassion on His people and on His dwelling place."
2 Chronicles,36,16,"But they kept ridiculing God’s messengers, despising His words, and scoffing at His prophets, until the LORD’s wrath was so stirred up against His people that there was no remedy."
2 Chronicles,36,17,"So He brought up against them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their choice young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary. He had no pity on young men or young women, elderly or aged; He handed them all over to him."
2 Chronicles,36,18,"He took everything to Babylon—all the articles of God’s temple, large and small, the treasures of the LORD’s temple, and the treasures of the king and his officials."
2 Chronicles,36,19,"Then the Chaldeans burned God’s temple. They tore down Jerusalem’s wall, burned down all its palaces, and destroyed all its valuable articles."
2 Chronicles,36,20,"He deported those who escaped from the sword to Babylon, and they became servants to him and his sons until the rise of the Persian kingdom."
2 Chronicles,36,21,This fulfilled the word of the LORD through Jeremiah and the land enjoyed its Sabbath rest all the days of the desolation until 70 years were fulfilled.
2 Chronicles,36,22,"In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, the word of the LORD spoken through Jeremiah was fulfilled. The LORD put it into the mind of King Cyrus of Persia to issue a proclamation throughout his entire kingdom and also to put it in writing:"
2 Chronicles,36,23,"This is what King Cyrus of Persia says: The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and has appointed me to build Him a temple at Jerusalem in Judah. Whoever among you of His people may go up, and may the LORD his God be with him."
Ezra,1,1,"In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, the word of the LORD spoken through Jeremiah was fulfilled. The LORD put it into the mind of King Cyrus to issue a proclamation throughout his entire kingdom and to put it in writing:"
Ezra,1,2,"This is what King Cyrus of Persia says: “The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and has appointed me to build Him a house at Jerusalem in Judah."
Ezra,1,3,"Whoever is among His people, may his God be with him, and may he go to Jerusalem in Judah and build the house of the LORD, the God of Israel, the God who is in Jerusalem."
Ezra,1,4,"Let every survivor, wherever he lives, be assisted by the men of that region with silver, gold, goods, and livestock, along with a freewill offering for the house of God in Jerusalem.”"
Ezra,1,5,"So the family leaders of Judah and Benjamin, along with the priests and Levites—everyone God had motivated—prepared to go up and rebuild the LORD’s house in Jerusalem."
Ezra,1,6,"All their neighbors supported them with silver articles, gold, goods, livestock, and valuables, in addition to all that was given as a freewill offering."
Ezra,1,7,King Cyrus also brought out the articles of the LORD’s house that Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem and had placed in the house of his gods.
Ezra,1,8,"King Cyrus of Persia had them brought out under the supervision of Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah."
Ezra,1,9,"This was the inventory: 30 gold basins, 1,000 silver basins, 29 silver knives,"
Ezra,1,10,"30 gold bowls, 410 various silver bowls, and 1,000 other articles."
Ezra,1,11,"The gold and silver articles totaled 5,400. Sheshbazzar brought all of them when the exiles went up from Babylon to Jerusalem."
Ezra,2,1,"These now are the people of the province who came from those captive exiles King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had deported to Babylon. They returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own town."
Ezra,2,2,"They came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah. The number of the Israelite men included:"

Ezra,2,60,"Delaiah’s descendants, Tobiah’s descendants, Nekoda’s descendants 652"
Ezra,2,61,"and from the descendants of the priests: the descendants of Hobaiah, the descendants of Hakkoz, the descendants of Barzillai—who had taken a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by their name."
Ezra,2,62,"These searched for their entries in the genealogical records, but they could not be found, so they were disqualified from the priesthood."
Ezra,2,63,The governor ordered them not to eat the most holy things until there was a priest who could consult the Urim and Thummim.
Ezra,2,64,"The whole combined assembly numbered 42,360"
Ezra,2,65,"not including their 7,337 male and female slaves, and their 200 male and female singers."
Ezra,2,66,"They had 736 horses, 245 mules,"
Ezra,2,67,"435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys."
Ezra,2,68,"After they arrived at the LORD’s house in Jerusalem, some of the family leaders gave freewill offerings for the house of God in order to have it rebuilt on its original site."
Ezra,2,69,"Based on what they could give, they gave 61,000 gold coins, 6,250 pounds of silver, and 100 priestly garments to the treasury for the project."
Ezra,2,70,"The priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, temple servants, and some of the people settled in their towns, and the rest of Israel settled in their towns."
Ezra,3,1,"By the seventh month, the Israelites had settled in their towns, and the people gathered together in Jerusalem."
Ezra,3,2,"Jeshua son of Jozadak and his brothers the priests along with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and his brothers began to build the altar of Israel’s God in order to offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the law of Moses, the man of God."
Ezra,3,3,They set up the altar on its foundation and offered burnt offerings for the morning and evening on it to the LORD even though they feared the surrounding peoples.
Ezra,3,4,"They celebrated the Festival of Booths as prescribed, and offered burnt offerings each day, based on the number specified by ordinance for each festival day."
Ezra,3,5,"After that, they offered the regular burnt offering and the offerings for the beginning of each month and for all the LORD’s appointed holy occasions, as well as the freewill offerings brought to the LORD."
Ezra,3,6,"On the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD, even though the foundation of the LORD’s temple had not yet been laid."
Ezra,3,7,"They gave money to the stonecutters and artisans, and gave food, drink, and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre, so they could bring cedar wood from Lebanon to Joppa by sea, according to the authorization given them by King Cyrus of Persia."
Ezra,3,8,"In the second month of the second year after they arrived at God’s house in Jerusalem, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Jeshua son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brothers, including the priests, the Levites, and all who had returned to Jerusalem from the captivity, began to build. They appointed the Levites who were 20 years old or more to supervise the work on the LORD’s house."
Ezra,3,9,"Jeshua with his sons and brothers, Kadmiel with his sons, and the sons of Judah and of Henadad, with their sons and brothers, the Levites, joined together to supervise those working on the house of God."
Ezra,3,10,"When the builders had laid the foundation of the LORD’s temple, the priests, dressed in their robes and holding trumpets, and the Levites descended from Asaph, holding cymbals, took their positions to praise the LORD, as King David of Israel had instructed."
Ezra,3,11,They sang with praise and thanksgiving to the LORD: “For He is good; His faithful love to Israel endures forever.” Then all the people gave a great shout of praise to the LORD because the foundation of the LORD’s house had been laid.
Ezra,3,12,"But many of the older priests, Levites, and family leaders, who had seen the first temple, wept loudly when they saw the foundation of this house, but many others shouted joyfully."
Ezra,3,13,"The people could not distinguish the sound of the joyful shouting from that of the weeping, because the people were shouting so loudly. And the sound was heard far away."
Ezra,4,1,"When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the returned exiles were building a temple for Yahweh, the God of Israel,"
Ezra,4,2,"they approached Zerubbabel and the leaders of the families and said to them, “Let us build with you, for we also worship your God and have been sacrificing to Him since the time King Esar-haddon of Assyria brought us here.”"
Ezra,4,3,"But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the other leaders of Israel’s families answered them, “You may have no part with us in building a house for our God, since we alone must build it for Yahweh, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus, the king of Persia has commanded us.”"
Ezra,4,4,Then the people who were already in the land discouraged the people of Judah and made them afraid to build.
Ezra,4,5,They also bribed officials to act against them to frustrate their plans throughout the reign of King Cyrus of Persia and until the reign of King Darius of Persia.
Ezra,4,6,"At the beginning of the reign of Ahasuerus, the people who were already in the land wrote an accusation against the residents of Judah and Jerusalem."
Ezra,4,7,"During the time of King Artaxerxes of Persia, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel and the rest of his colleagues wrote to King Artaxerxes. The letter was written in Aramaic and translated."
Ezra,4,8,Rehum the chief deputy and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter to King Artaxerxes concerning Jerusalem as follows:
Ezra,4,9,"From Rehum the chief deputy, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their colleagues—the judges and magistrates from Tripolis, Persia, Erech, Babylon, Susa (that is, the people of Elam),"
Ezra,4,10,and the rest of the peoples whom the great and illustrious Ashurbanipal deported and settled in the cities of Samaria and the region west of the Euphrates River.
Ezra,4,11,"This is the text of the letter they sent to him: To King Artaxerxes from your servants, the men from the region west of the Euphrates River:"
Ezra,4,12,"Let it be known to the king that the Jews who came from you have returned to us at Jerusalem. They are rebuilding that rebellious and evil city, finishing its walls, and repairing its foundations."
Ezra,4,13,"Let it now be known to the king that if that city is rebuilt and its walls are finished, they will not pay tribute, duty, or land tax, and the royal revenue will suffer."
Ezra,4,14,"Since we have taken an oath of loyalty to the king, and it is not right for us to witness his dishonor, we have sent to inform the king"
Ezra,4,15,"that a search should be made in your fathers’ record books. In these record books you will discover and verify that the city is a rebellious city, harmful to kings and provinces. There have been revolts in it since ancient times. That is why this city was destroyed."
Ezra,4,16,"We advise the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are finished, you will not have any possession west of the Euphrates."
Ezra,4,17,"The king sent a reply to his chief deputy Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their colleagues living in Samaria and elsewhere in the region west of the Euphrates River: Greetings."
Ezra,4,18,The letter you sent us has been translated and read in my presence.
Ezra,4,19,"I issued a decree and a search was conducted. It was discovered that this city has had uprisings against kings since ancient times, and there have been rebellions and revolts in it."
Ezra,4,20,"Powerful kings have also ruled over Jerusalem and exercised authority over the whole region, and tribute, duty, and land tax were paid to them."
Ezra,4,21,"Therefore, issue an order for these men to stop, so that this city will not be rebuilt until a further decree has been pronounced by me."
Ezra,4,22,"See that you not neglect this matter. Otherwise, the damage will increase and the royal interests will suffer."
Ezra,4,23,"As soon as the text of King Artaxerxes’ letter was read to Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their colleagues, they immediately went to the Jews in Jerusalem and forcibly stopped them."
Ezra,4,24,Now the construction of God’s house in Jerusalem had stopped and remained at a standstill until the second year of the reign of King Darius of Persia.
Ezra,5,1,"But when the prophets Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel who was over them,"
Ezra,5,2,"Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak began to rebuild God’s house in Jerusalem. The prophets of God were with them, helping them."
Ezra,5,3,"At that time Tattenai the governor of the region west of the Euphrates River, Shethar-bozenai, and their colleagues came to the Jews and asked, “Who gave you the order to rebuild this temple and finish this structure?”"
Ezra,5,4,"They also asked them, “What are the names of the workers who are constructing this building?”"
Ezra,5,5,"But God was watching over the Jewish elders. These men wouldn’t stop them until a report was sent to Darius, so that they could receive written instructions about this matter."
Ezra,5,6,"This is the text of the letter that Tattenai the governor of the region west of the Euphrates River, Shethar-bozenai, and their colleagues, the officials in the region, sent to King Darius."
Ezra,5,7,"They sent him a report, written as follows: To King Darius: All greetings."
Ezra,5,8,"Let it be known to the king that we went to the house of the great God in the province of Judah. It is being built with cut stones, and its beams are being set in the walls. This work is being done diligently and succeeding through the people’s efforts."
Ezra,5,9,"So we questioned the elders and asked, “Who gave you the order to rebuild this temple and finish this structure?”"
Ezra,5,10,"We also asked them for their names, so that we could write down the names of their leaders for your information."
Ezra,5,11,"This is the reply they gave us: We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth and are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished."
Ezra,5,12,"But since our fathers angered the God of heaven, He handed them over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this temple and deported the people to Babylon."
Ezra,5,13,"However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, he issued a decree to rebuild the house of God."
Ezra,5,14,"He also took from the temple in Babylon the gold and silver articles of God’s house that Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem and carried them to the temple in Babylon. He released them from the temple in Babylon to a man named Sheshbazzar, the governor by the appointment of King Cyrus."
Ezra,5,15,"Cyrus told him, “Take these articles, put them in the temple in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt on its original site.”"
Ezra,5,16,"Then this same Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundation of God’s house in Jerusalem. It has been under construction from that time until now, yet it has not been completed."
Ezra,5,17,"So if it pleases the king, let a search of the royal archives in Babylon be conducted to see if it is true that a decree was issued by King Cyrus to rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem. Let the king’s decision regarding this matter be sent to us."
Ezra,6,1,"King Darius gave the order, and they searched in the library of Babylon in the archives."
Ezra,6,2,But it was in the fortress of Ecbatana in the province of Media that a scroll was found with this record written on it:
Ezra,6,3,"In the first year of King Cyrus, he issued a decree concerning the house of God in Jerusalem: Let the house be rebuilt as a place for offering sacrifices, and let its original foundations be retained. Its height is to be 90 feet and its width 90 feet,"
Ezra,6,4,with three layers of cut stones and one of timber. The cost is to be paid from the royal treasury.
Ezra,6,5,The gold and silver articles of God’s house that Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and carried to Babylon must also be returned. They are to be brought to the temple in Jerusalem where they belong and put into the house of God.
Ezra,6,6,"Therefore, you must stay away from that place, Tattenai governor of the region west of the Euphrates River, Shethar-bozenai, and your colleagues, the officials in the region."
Ezra,6,7,Leave the construction of the house of God alone. Let the governor and elders of the Jews rebuild this house of God on its original site.
Ezra,6,8,"I hereby issue a decree concerning what you must do, so that the elders of the Jews can rebuild the house of God: The cost is to be paid in full to these men out of the royal revenues from the taxes of the region west of the Euphrates River, so that the work will not stop."
Ezra,6,9,"Whatever is needed—young bulls, rams, and lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, or wheat, salt, wine, and oil, as requested by the priests in Jerusalem—let it be given to them every day without fail,"
Ezra,6,10,so that they can offer sacrifices of pleasing aroma to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons.
Ezra,6,11,"I also issue a decree concerning any man who interferes with this directive: Let a beam be torn from his house and raised up; he will be impaled on it, and his house will be made into a garbage dump because of this offense."
Ezra,6,12,"May the God who caused His name to dwell there overthrow any king or people who dares to harm or interfere with this house of God in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have issued the decree. Let it be carried out diligently."
Ezra,6,13,"Then Tattenai governor of the region west of the Euphrates River, Shethar-bozenai, and their colleagues diligently carried out what King Darius had decreed."
Ezra,6,14,"So the Jewish elders continued successfully with the building under the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah son of Iddo. They finished the building according to the command of the God of Israel and the decrees of Cyrus, Darius, and King Artaxerxes of Persia."
Ezra,6,15,This house was completed on the third day of the month of Adar in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.
Ezra,6,16,"Then the Israelites, including the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the exiles, celebrated the dedication of the house of God with joy."
Ezra,6,17,"For the dedication of God’s house they offered 100 bulls, 200 rams, and 400 lambs, as well as 12 male goats as a sin offering for all Israel—one for each Israelite tribe."
Ezra,6,18,"They also appointed the priests by their divisions and the Levites by their groups to the service of God in Jerusalem, according to what is written in the book of Moses."
Ezra,6,19,The exiles observed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.
Ezra,6,20,"All of the priests and Levites were ceremonially clean, because they had purified themselves. They killed the Passover lamb for themselves, their priestly brothers, and all the exiles."
Ezra,6,21,"The Israelites who had returned from exile ate it, together with all who had separated themselves from the uncleanness of the Gentiles of the land in order to worship Yahweh, the God of Israel."
Ezra,6,22,"They observed the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days with joy, because the LORD had made them joyful, having changed the Assyrian king’s attitude toward them, so that he supported them in the work on the house of the God of Israel."
Ezra,7,1,"After these events, during the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia, Ezra— Seraiah’s son, Azariah’s son, Hilkiah’s son,"
Ezra,7,2,"Shallum’s son, Zadok’s son, Ahitub’s son,"
Ezra,7,3,"Amariah’s son, Azariah’s son, Meraioth’s son,"
Ezra,7,4,"Zerahiah’s son, Uzzi’s son, Bukki’s son,"
Ezra,7,5,"Abishua’s son, Phinehas’s son, Eleazar’s son, Aaron the chief priest’s son"
Ezra,7,6,"—came up from Babylon. He was a scribe skilled in the law of Moses, which Yahweh, the God of Israel, had given. The king had granted him everything he requested because the hand of Yahweh his God was on him."
Ezra,7,7,"Some of the Israelites, priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and temple servants accompanied him to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes."
Ezra,7,8,"Ezra came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, during the seventh year of the king."
Ezra,7,9,He began the journey from Babylon on the first day of the first month and arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month since the gracious hand of his God was on him.
Ezra,7,10,"Now Ezra had determined in his heart to study the law of the LORD, obey it, and teach its statutes and ordinances in Israel."
Ezra,7,11,"This is the text of the letter King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest and scribe, an expert in matters of the LORD’s commands and statutes for Israel:"
Ezra,7,12,"Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, an expert in the law of the God of heaven: Greetings."
Ezra,7,13,"I issue a decree that any of the Israelites in my kingdom, including their priests and Levites, who want to go to Jerusalem, may go with you."
Ezra,7,14,"You are sent by the king and his seven counselors to evaluate Judah and Jerusalem according to the law of your God, which is in your possession."
Ezra,7,15,"You are also to bring the silver and gold the king and his counselors have willingly given to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem,"
Ezra,7,16,"and all the silver and gold you receive throughout the province of Babylon, together with the freewill offerings given by the people and the priests to the house of their God in Jerusalem."
Ezra,7,17,"Then you are to buy with this money as many bulls, rams, and lambs as needed, along with their grain and drink offerings, and offer them on the altar at the house of your God in Jerusalem."
Ezra,7,18,"You may do whatever seems best to you and your brothers with the rest of the silver and gold, according to the will of your God."
Ezra,7,19,You must deliver to the God of Jerusalem all the articles given to you for the service of the house of your God.
Ezra,7,20,You may use the royal treasury to pay for anything else needed for the house of your God.
Ezra,7,21,"I, King Artaxerxes, issue a decree to all the treasurers in the region west of the Euphrates River: Whatever Ezra the priest, an expert in the law of the God of heaven, asks of you must be provided promptly,"
Ezra,7,22,"up to 7,500 pounds of silver, 500 bushels of wheat, 550 gallons of wine, 550 gallons of oil, and salt without limit."
Ezra,7,23,"Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven must be done diligently for the house of the God of heaven, so that wrath will not fall on the realm of the king and his sons."
Ezra,7,24,"Be advised that tribute, duty, and land tax must not be imposed on any priests, Levites, singers, doorkeepers, temple servants, or other servants of this house of God."
Ezra,7,25,"And you, Ezra, according to God’s wisdom that you possess, appoint magistrates and judges to judge all the people in the region west of the Euphrates who know the laws of your God and to teach anyone who does not know them."
Ezra,7,26,"Anyone who does not keep the law of your God and the law of the king, let a fair judgment be executed against him, whether death, banishment, confiscation of property, or imprisonment."
Ezra,7,27,"Praise Yahweh the God of our fathers, who has put it into the king’s mind to glorify the house of the LORD in Jerusalem,"
Ezra,7,28,"and who has shown favor to me before the king, his counselors, and all his powerful officers. So I took courage because I was strengthened by Yahweh my God, and I gathered Israelite leaders to return with me."
Ezra,8,1,These are the family leaders and the genealogical records of those who returned with me from Babylon during the reign of King Artaxerxes:
Ezra,8,2,"Gershom, from Phinehas’s descendants; Daniel, from Ithamar’s descendants; Hattush, from David’s descendants,"
Ezra,8,3,"who was of Shecaniah’s descendants; Zechariah, from Parosh’s descendants, and 150 men with him who were registered by genealogy;"
Ezra,8,4,"Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah from Pahath-moab’s descendants, and 200 men with him;"
Ezra,8,5,"Shecaniah son of Jahaziel from Zattu’s descendants, and 300 men with him;"
Ezra,8,6,"Ebed son of Jonathan from Adin’s descendants, and 50 men with him;"
Ezra,8,7,"Jeshaiah son of Athaliah from Elam’s descendants, and 70 men with him;"
Ezra,8,8,"Zebadiah son of Michael from Shephatiah’s descendants, and 80 men with him;"
Ezra,8,9,"Obadiah son of Jehiel from Joab’s descendants, and 218 men with him;"
Ezra,8,10,"Shelomith son of Josiphiah from Bani’s descendants, and 160 men with him;"
Ezra,8,11,"Zechariah son of Bebai from Bebai’s descendants, and 28 men with him;"
Ezra,8,12,"Johanan son of Hakkatan from Azgad’s descendants, and 110 men with him;"
Ezra,8,13,"these are the last ones, from Adonikam’s descendants, and their names are: Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah, and 60 men with them;"
Ezra,8,14,"Uthai and Zaccur from Bigvai’s descendants, and 70 men with them."
Ezra,8,15,"I gathered them at the river that flows to Ahava, and we camped there for three days. I searched among the people and priests, but found no Levites there."
Ezra,8,16,"Then I summoned the leaders: Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, as well as the teachers Joiarib and Elnathan."
Ezra,8,17,"I sent them to Iddo, the leader at Casiphia, with a message for him and his brothers, the temple servants at Casiphia, that they should bring us ministers for the house of our God."
Ezra,8,18,"Since the gracious hand of our God was on us, they brought us Sherebiah—a man of insight from the descendants of Mahli, a descendant of Levi son of Israel—along with his sons and brothers, 18 men,"
Ezra,8,19,"plus Hashabiah, along with Jeshaiah, from the descendants of Merari, and his brothers and their sons, 20 men."
Ezra,8,20,"There were also 220 of the temple servants, who had been appointed by David and the leaders for the work of the Levites. All were identified by name."
Ezra,8,21,"I proclaimed a fast by the Ahava River, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask Him for a safe journey for us, our children, and all our possessions."
Ezra,8,22,"I did this because I was ashamed to ask the king for infantry and cavalry to protect us from enemies during the journey, since we had told him, “The hand of our God is gracious to all who seek Him, but His great anger is against all who abandon Him.”"
Ezra,8,23,"So we fasted and pleaded with our God about this, and He granted our request."
Ezra,8,24,"I selected 12 of the leading priests, along with Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and 10 of their brothers."
Ezra,8,25,"I weighed out to them the silver, the gold, and the articles—the contribution for the house of our God that the king, his counselors, his leaders, and all the Israelites who were present had offered."
Ezra,8,26,"I weighed out to them 24 tons of silver, silver articles weighing 7,500 pounds, 7,500 pounds of gold,"
Ezra,8,27,"20 gold bowls worth 1,000 gold coins, and two articles of fine gleaming bronze, as valuable as gold."
Ezra,8,28,"Then I said to them, “You are holy to the LORD, and the articles are holy. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to the LORD God of your fathers."
Ezra,8,29,"Guard them carefully until you weigh them out in the chambers of the LORD’s house before the leading priests, Levites, and heads of the Israelite families in Jerusalem.”"
Ezra,8,30,"So the priests and Levites took charge of the silver, the gold, and the articles that had been weighed out, to bring them to the house of our God in Jerusalem."
Ezra,8,31,"We set out from the Ahava River on the twelfth day of the first month to go to Jerusalem. We were strengthened by our God, and He protected us from the power of the enemy and from ambush along the way."
Ezra,8,32,So we arrived at Jerusalem and rested there for three days.
Ezra,8,33,"On the fourth day the silver, the gold, and the articles were weighed out in the house of our God into the care of Meremoth the priest, son of Uriah. Eleazar son of Phinehas was with him. The Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui were also with them."
Ezra,8,34,"Everything was verified by number and weight, and the total weight was recorded at that time."
Ezra,8,35,"The exiles who had returned from the captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel: 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, and 77 lambs, along with 12 male goats as a sin offering. All this was a burnt offering for the LORD."
Ezra,8,36,"They also delivered the king’s edicts to the royal satraps and governors of the region west of the Euphrates, so that they would support the people and the house of God."
Ezra,9,1,"After these things had been done, the leaders approached me and said: “The people of Israel, the priests, and the Levites have not separated themselves from the surrounding peoples whose detestable practices are like those of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites."
Ezra,9,2,"Indeed, the Israelite men have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons, so that the holy seed has become mixed with the surrounding peoples. The leaders and officials have taken the lead in this unfaithfulness!”"
Ezra,9,3,"When I heard this report, I tore my tunic and robe, pulled out some of the hair from my head and beard, and sat down devastated."
Ezra,9,4,"Everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me, because of the unfaithfulness of the exiles, while I sat devastated until the evening offering."
Ezra,9,5,"At the evening offering, I got up from my humiliation, with my tunic and robe torn. Then I fell on my knees and spread out my hands to Yahweh my God."
Ezra,9,6,"And I said: My God, I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift my face toward You, my God, because our iniquities are higher than our heads and our guilt is as high as the heavens."
Ezra,9,7,"Our guilt has been terrible from the days of our fathers until the present. Because of our iniquities we have been handed over, along with our kings and priests, to the surrounding kings, and to the sword, captivity, plundering, and open shame, as it is today."
Ezra,9,8,"But now, for a brief moment, grace has come from Yahweh our God to preserve a remnant for us and give us a stake in His holy place. Even in our slavery, God has given us new life and light to our eyes."
Ezra,9,9,"Though we are slaves, our God has not abandoned us in our slavery. He has extended grace to us in the presence of the Persian kings, giving us new life, so that we can rebuild the house of our God and repair its ruins, to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem."
Ezra,9,10,"Now, our God, what can we say in light of this? For we have abandoned the commands"
Ezra,9,11,"You gave through Your servants the prophets, saying: “The land you are entering to possess is an impure land. The surrounding peoples have filled it from end to end with their uncleanness by their impurity and detestable practices."
Ezra,9,12,"So do not give your daughters to their sons in marriage or take their daughters for your sons. Never seek their peace or prosperity, so that you will be strong, eat the good things of the land, and leave it as an inheritance to your sons forever.”"
Ezra,9,13,"After all that has happened to us because of our evil deeds and terrible guilt—though You, our God, have punished us less than our sins deserve and have allowed us to survive—"
Ezra,9,14,"should we break Your commands again and intermarry with the peoples who commit these detestable practices? Wouldn’t You become so angry with us that You would destroy us, leaving no survivors?"
Ezra,9,15,"LORD God of Israel, You are righteous, for we survive as a remnant today. Here we are before You with our guilt, though no one can stand in Your presence because of this."
Ezra,10,1,"While Ezra prayed and confessed, weeping and falling facedown before the house of God, an extremely large assembly of Israelite men, women, and children gathered around him. The people also wept bitterly."
Ezra,10,2,"Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, an Elamite, responded to Ezra: “We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the surrounding peoples, but there is still hope for Israel in spite of this."
Ezra,10,3,"Let us therefore make a covenant before our God to send away all the foreign wives and their children, according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the command of our God. Let it be done according to the law."
Ezra,10,4,"Get up, for this matter is your responsibility, and we support you. Be strong and take action!”"
Ezra,10,5,"Then Ezra got up and made the leading priests, Levites, and all Israel take an oath to do what had been said; so they took the oath."
Ezra,10,6,"Ezra then went from the house of God and walked to the chamber of Jehohanan son of Eliashib, where he spent the night. He did not eat food or drink water, because he was mourning over the unfaithfulness of the exiles."
Ezra,10,7,They circulated a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem that all the exiles should gather at Jerusalem.
Ezra,10,8,"Whoever did not come within three days would forfeit all his possessions, according to the decision of the leaders and elders, and would be excluded from the assembly of the exiles."
Ezra,10,9,"So all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered in Jerusalem within the three days. On the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people sat in the square at the house of God, trembling because of this matter and because of the heavy rain."
Ezra,10,10,"Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have been unfaithful by marrying foreign women, adding to Israel’s guilt."
Ezra,10,11,"Therefore, make a confession to Yahweh the God of your fathers and do His will. Separate yourselves from the surrounding peoples and your foreign wives.”"
Ezra,10,12,"Then all the assembly responded with a loud voice: “Yes, we will do as you say!"
Ezra,10,13,"But there are many people, and it is the rainy season. We don’t have the stamina to stay out in the open. This isn’t something that can be done in a day or two, for we have rebelled terribly in this matter."
Ezra,10,14,"Let our leaders represent the entire assembly. Then let all those in our towns who have married foreign women come at appointed times, together with the elders and judges of each town, in order to avert the fierce anger of our God concerning this matter.”"
Ezra,10,15,"Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah opposed this, with Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supporting them."
Ezra,10,16,"The exiles did what had been proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were family leaders, all identified by name, to represent their ancestral houses. They convened on the first day of the tenth month to investigate the matter,"
Ezra,10,17,and by the first day of the first month they had dealt with all the men who had married foreign women.
Ezra,10,18,"The following were found to have married foreign women from the descendants of the priests: from the descendants of Jeshua son of Jozadak and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah."
Ezra,10,19,"They pledged to send their wives away, and being guilty, they offered a ram from the flock for their guilt;"

Nehemiah,1,1,"During the month of Chislev in the twentieth year, when I was in the fortress city of Susa,"
Nehemiah,1,2,"Hanani, one of my brothers, arrived with men from Judah, and I questioned them about Jerusalem and the Jewish remnant that had survived the exile."
Nehemiah,1,3,"They said to me, “The remnant in the province, who survived the exile, are in great trouble and disgrace. Jerusalem’s wall has been broken down, and its gates have been burned down.”"
Nehemiah,1,4,"When I heard these words, I sat down and wept. I mourned for a number of days, fasting and praying before the God of heaven."
Nehemiah,1,5,"I said, Yahweh, the God of heaven, the great and awe-inspiring God who keeps His gracious covenant with those who love Him and keep His commands,"
Nehemiah,1,6,"let Your eyes be open and Your ears be attentive to hear Your servant’s prayer that I now pray to You day and night for Your servants, the Israelites. I confess the sins we have committed against You. Both I and my father’s house have sinned."
Nehemiah,1,7,"We have acted corruptly toward You and have not kept the commands, statutes, and ordinances You gave Your servant Moses."
Nehemiah,1,8,"Please remember what You commanded Your servant Moses: “If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the peoples."
Nehemiah,1,9,"But if you return to Me and carefully observe My commands, even though your exiles were banished to the ends of the earth, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place where I chose to have My name dwell.”"
Nehemiah,1,10,They are Your servants and Your people. You redeemed them by Your great power and strong hand.
Nehemiah,1,11,"Please, Lord, let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant and to that of Your servants who delight to revere Your name. Give Your servant success today, and have compassion on him in the presence of this man. At the time, I was the king’s cupbearer."
Nehemiah,2,1,"During the month of Nisan in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was set before him, I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had never been sad in his presence,"
Nehemiah,2,2,"so the king said to me, “Why are you sad, when you aren’t sick? This is nothing but depression.” I was overwhelmed with fear"
Nehemiah,2,3,"and replied to the king, “May the king live forever! Why should I not be sad when the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins and its gates have been destroyed by fire?”"
Nehemiah,2,4,"Then the king asked me, “What is your request?” So I prayed to the God of heaven"
Nehemiah,2,5,"and answered the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor with you, send me to Judah and to the city where my ancestors are buried, so that I may rebuild it.”"
Nehemiah,2,6,"The king, with the queen seated beside him, asked me, “How long will your journey take, and when will you return?” So I gave him a definite time, and it pleased the king to send me."
Nehemiah,2,7,"I also said to the king: “If it pleases the king, let me have letters written to the governors of the region west of the Euphrates River, so that they will grant me safe passage until I reach Judah."
Nehemiah,2,8,"And let me have a letter written to Asaph, keeper of the king’s forest, so that he will give me timber to rebuild the gates of the temple’s fortress, the city wall, and the home where I will live.” The king granted my requests, for I was graciously strengthened by my God."
Nehemiah,2,9,I went to the governors of the region west of the Euphrates and gave them the king’s letters. The king had also sent officers of the infantry and cavalry with me.
Nehemiah,2,10,"When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard that someone had come to seek the well-being of the Israelites, they were greatly displeased."
Nehemiah,2,11,"After I arrived in Jerusalem and had been there three days,"
Nehemiah,2,12,I got up at night and took a few men with me. I didn’t tell anyone what my God had laid on my heart to do for Jerusalem. The only animal I took was the one I was riding.
Nehemiah,2,13,"I went out at night through the Valley Gate toward the Serpent’s Well and the Dung Gate, and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem that had been broken down and its gates that had been destroyed by fire."
Nehemiah,2,14,"I went on to the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool, but farther down it became too narrow for my animal to go through."
Nehemiah,2,15,"So I went up at night by way of the valley and inspected the wall. Then heading back, I entered through the Valley Gate and returned."
Nehemiah,2,16,"The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, for I had not yet told the Jews, priests, nobles, officials, or the rest of those who would be doing the work."
Nehemiah,2,17,"So I said to them, “You see the trouble we are in. Jerusalem lies in ruins and its gates have been burned down. Come, let’s rebuild Jerusalem’s wall, so that we will no longer be a disgrace.”"
Nehemiah,2,18,"I told them how the gracious hand of my God had been on me, and what the king had said to me. They said, “Let’s start rebuilding,” and they were encouraged to do this good work."
Nehemiah,2,19,"When Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard about this, they mocked and despised us, and said, “What is this you’re doing? Are you rebelling against the king?”"
Nehemiah,2,20,"I gave them this reply, “The God of heaven is the One who will grant us success. We, His servants, will start building, but you have no share, right, or historic claim in Jerusalem.”"
Nehemiah,3,1,"Eliashib the high priest and his fellow priests began rebuilding the Sheep Gate. They dedicated it and installed its doors. After building the wall to the Tower of the Hundred and the Tower of Hananel, they dedicated it."
Nehemiah,3,2,"The men of Jericho built next to Eliashib, and next to them Zaccur son of Imri built."

Nehemiah,4,1,"When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became furious. He mocked the Jews"
Nehemiah,4,2,"before his colleagues and the powerful men of Samaria, and said, “What are these pathetic Jews doing? Can they restore it by themselves? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they ever finish it? Can they bring these burnt stones back to life from the mounds of rubble?”"
Nehemiah,4,3,"Then Tobiah the Ammonite, who was beside him, said, “Indeed, even if a fox climbed up what they are building, he would break down their stone wall!”"
Nehemiah,4,4,"Listen, our God, for we are despised. Make their insults return on their own heads and let them be taken as plunder to a land of captivity."
Nehemiah,4,5,"Do not cover their guilt or let their sin be erased from Your sight, because they have provoked the builders."
Nehemiah,4,6,"So we rebuilt the wall until the entire wall was joined together up to half its height, for the people had the will to keep working."
Nehemiah,4,7,"When Sanballat, Tobiah, and the Arabs, Ammonites, and Ashdodites heard that the repair to the walls of Jerusalem was progressing and that the gaps were being closed, they became furious."
Nehemiah,4,8,They all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and throw it into confusion.
Nehemiah,4,9,So we prayed to our God and stationed a guard because of them day and night.
Nehemiah,4,10,"In Judah, it was said: The strength of the laborer fails, since there is so much rubble. We will never be able to rebuild the wall."
Nehemiah,4,11,"And our enemies said, “They won’t know or see anything until we’re among them and can kill them and stop the work.”"
Nehemiah,4,12,"When the Jews who lived nearby arrived, they said to us time and again, “Everywhere you turn, they attack us.”"
Nehemiah,4,13,"So I stationed people behind the lowest sections of the wall, at the vulnerable areas. I stationed them by families with their swords, spears, and bows."
Nehemiah,4,14,"After I made an inspection, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, “Don’t be afraid of them. Remember the great and awe-inspiring Lord, and fight for your countrymen, your sons and daughters, your wives and homes.”"
Nehemiah,4,15,"When our enemies heard that we knew their scheme and that God had frustrated it, every one of us returned to his own work on the wall."
Nehemiah,4,16,"From that day on, half of my men did the work while the other half held spears, shields, bows, and armor. The officers supported all the people of Judah,"
Nehemiah,4,17,who were rebuilding the wall. The laborers who carried the loads worked with one hand and held a weapon with the other.
Nehemiah,4,18,"Each of the builders had his sword strapped around his waist while he was building, and the trumpeter was beside me."
Nehemiah,4,19,"Then I said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people: “The work is enormous and spread out, and we are separated far from one another along the wall."
Nehemiah,4,20,"Wherever you hear the trumpet sound, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us!”"
Nehemiah,4,21,"So we continued the work, while half of the men were holding spears from daybreak until the stars came out."
Nehemiah,4,22,"At that time, I also said to the people, “Let everyone and his servant spend the night inside Jerusalem, so that they can stand guard by night and work by day.”"
Nehemiah,4,23,"And I, my brothers, my men, and the guards with me never took off our clothes. Each carried his weapon, even when washing."
Nehemiah,5,1,There was a widespread outcry from the people and their wives against their Jewish countrymen.
Nehemiah,5,2,"Some were saying, “We, our sons, and our daughters are numerous. Let us get grain so that we can eat and live.”"
Nehemiah,5,3,"Others were saying, “We are mortgaging our fields, vineyards, and homes to get grain during the famine.”"
Nehemiah,5,4,"Still others were saying, “We have borrowed money to pay the king’s tax on our fields and vineyards."
Nehemiah,5,5,"We and our children are just like our countrymen and their children, yet we are subjecting our sons and daughters to slavery. Some of our daughters are already enslaved, but we are powerless because our fields and vineyards belong to others.”"
Nehemiah,5,6,I became extremely angry when I heard their outcry and these complaints.
Nehemiah,5,7,"After seriously considering the matter, I accused the nobles and officials, saying to them, “Each of you is charging his countrymen interest.” So I called a large assembly against them"
Nehemiah,5,8,"and said, “We have done our best to buy back our Jewish countrymen who were sold to foreigners, but now you sell your own countrymen, and we have to buy them back.” They remained silent and could not say a word."
Nehemiah,5,9,"Then I said, “What you are doing isn’t right. Shouldn’t you walk in the fear of our God and not invite the reproach of our foreign enemies?"
Nehemiah,5,10,"Even I, as well as my brothers and my servants, have been lending them money and grain. Please, let us stop charging this interest."
Nehemiah,5,11,"Return their fields, vineyards, olive groves, and houses to them immediately, along with the percentage of the money, grain, new wine, and olive oil that you have been assessing them.”"
Nehemiah,5,12,They responded: “We will return these things and require nothing more from them. We will do as you say.” So I summoned the priests and made everyone take an oath to do this.
Nehemiah,5,13,"I also shook the folds of my robe and said, “May God likewise shake from his house and property everyone who doesn’t keep this promise. May he be shaken out and have nothing!” The whole assembly said, “Amen,” and they praised the LORD. Then the people did as they had promised."
Nehemiah,5,14,"Furthermore, from the day King Artaxerxes appointed me to be their governor in the land of Judah—from the twentieth year until his thirty-second year, 12 years—I and my associates never ate from the food allotted to the governor."
Nehemiah,5,15,"The governors who preceded me had heavily burdened the people, taking food and wine from them, as well as a pound of silver. Their subordinates also oppressed the people, but I didn’t do this, because of the fear of God."
Nehemiah,5,16,"Instead, I devoted myself to the construction of the wall, and all my subordinates were gathered there for the work. We didn’t buy any land."
Nehemiah,5,17,"There were 150 Jews and officials, as well as guests from the surrounding nations at my table."
Nehemiah,5,18,"Each day, one ox, six choice sheep, and some fowl were prepared for me. An abundance of all kinds of wine was provided every 10 days. But I didn’t demand the food allotted to the governor, because the burden on the people was so heavy."
Nehemiah,5,19,"Remember me favorably, my God, for all that I have done for this people."
Nehemiah,6,1,"When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall and that no gap was left in it—though at that time I had not installed the doors in the gates—"
Nehemiah,6,2,"Sanballat and Geshem sent me a message: “Come, let’s meet together in the villages of the Ono Valley.” But they were planning to harm me."
Nehemiah,6,3,"So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work and cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and go down to you?”"
Nehemiah,6,4,"Four times they sent me the same proposal, and I gave them the same reply."
Nehemiah,6,5,"Sanballat sent me this same message a fifth time by his aide, who had an open letter in his hand."
Nehemiah,6,6,"In it was written: It is reported among the nations—and Geshem agrees—that you and the Jews plan to rebel. This is the reason you are building the wall. According to these reports, you are to become their king"
Nehemiah,6,7,"and have even set up the prophets in Jerusalem to proclaim on your behalf: “There is a king in Judah.” These rumors will be heard by the king. So come, let’s confer together."
Nehemiah,6,8,"Then I replied to him, “There is nothing to these rumors you are spreading; you are inventing them in your own mind.”"
Nehemiah,6,9,"For they were all trying to intimidate us, saying, “They will become discouraged in the work, and it will never be finished.” But now, my God, strengthen me."
Nehemiah,6,10,"I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was restricted to his house. He said: Let us meet at the house of God inside the temple. Let us shut the temple doors because they are coming to kill you. They are coming to kill you tonight!"
Nehemiah,6,11,"But I said, “Should a man like me run away? How can I enter the temple and live? I will not go.”"
Nehemiah,6,12,"I realized that God had not sent him, because of the prophecy he spoke against me. Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him."
Nehemiah,6,13,"He was hired, so that I would be intimidated, do as he suggested, sin, and get a bad reputation, in order that they could discredit me."
Nehemiah,6,14,"My God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat for what they have done, and also Noadiah the prophetess and the other prophets who wanted to intimidate me."
Nehemiah,6,15,"The wall was completed in 52 days, on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul."
Nehemiah,6,16,"When all our enemies heard this, all the surrounding nations were intimidated and lost their confidence, for they realized that this task had been accomplished by our God."
Nehemiah,6,17,"During those days, the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah’s letters came to them."
Nehemiah,6,18,"For many in Judah were bound by oath to him, since he was a son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah."
Nehemiah,6,19,"These nobles kept mentioning Tobiah’s good deeds to me, and they reported my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me."
Nehemiah,7,1,"When the wall had been rebuilt and I had the doors installed, the gatekeepers, singers, and Levites were appointed."
Nehemiah,7,2,"Then I put my brother Hanani in charge of Jerusalem, along with Hananiah, commander of the fortress, because he was a faithful man who feared God more than most."
Nehemiah,7,3,"I said to them, “Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until the sun is hot, and let the doors be shut and securely fastened while the guards are on duty. Station the citizens of Jerusalem as guards, some at their posts and some at their homes.”"
Nehemiah,7,4,"The city was large and spacious, but there were few people in it, and no houses had been built yet."
Nehemiah,7,5,"Then my God put it into my mind to assemble the nobles, the officials, and the people to be registered by genealogy. I found the genealogical record of those who came back first, and I found the following written in it:"
Nehemiah,7,6,"These are the people of the province who went up among the captive exiles deported by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. Each of them returned to Jerusalem and Judah, to his own town."
Nehemiah,7,7,"They came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah. The number of the Israelite men included:"

Nehemiah,8,16,"The people went out, brought back branches, and made booths for themselves on each of their rooftops, and courtyards, the court of the house of God, the square by the Water Gate, and the square by the Gate of Ephraim."

Nehemiah,9,9,You saw the oppression of our ancestors in Egypt and heard their cry at the Red Sea.
Nehemiah,9,10,"You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, all his officials, and all the people of his land, for You knew how arrogantly they treated our ancestors. You made a name for Yourself that endures to this day."
Nehemiah,9,11,"You divided the sea before them, and they crossed through it on dry ground. You hurled their pursuers into the depths like a stone into churning waters."
Nehemiah,9,12,"You led them with a pillar of cloud by day, and with a pillar of fire by night, to illuminate the way they should go."
Nehemiah,9,13,"You came down on Mount Sinai, and spoke to them from heaven. You gave them impartial ordinances, reliable instructions, and good statutes and commands."
Nehemiah,9,14,"You revealed Your holy Sabbath to them, and gave them commands, statutes, and instruction through Your servant Moses."
Nehemiah,9,15,You provided bread from heaven for their hunger; You brought them water from the rock for their thirst. You told them to go in and possess the land You had sworn to give them.
Nehemiah,9,16,But our ancestors acted arrogantly; they became stiff-necked and did not listen to Your commands.
Nehemiah,9,17,"They refused to listen and did not remember Your wonders You performed among them. They became stiff-necked and appointed a leader to return to their slavery in Egypt. But You are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in faithful love, and You did not abandon them."
Nehemiah,9,18,"Even after they had cast an image of a calf for themselves and said, “This is your God who brought you out of Egypt,” and they had committed terrible blasphemies,"
Nehemiah,9,19,"You did not abandon them in the wilderness because of Your great compassion. During the day the pillar of cloud never turned away from them, guiding them on their journey. And during the night the pillar of fire illuminated the way they should go."
Nehemiah,9,20,"You sent Your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold Your manna from their mouths, and You gave them water for their thirst."
Nehemiah,9,21,"You provided for them in the wilderness 40 years and they lacked nothing. Their clothes did not wear out, and their feet did not swell."
Nehemiah,9,22,You gave them kingdoms and peoples and assigned them to be a boundary. They took possession of the land of Sihon king of Heshbon and of the land of Og king of Bashan.
Nehemiah,9,23,You multiplied their descendants like the stars of heaven and brought them to the land You told their ancestors to go in and take possession of it.
Nehemiah,9,24,"So their descendants went in and possessed the land: You subdued the Canaanites who inhabited the land before them and handed their kings and the surrounding peoples over to them, to do as they pleased with them."
Nehemiah,9,25,"They captured fortified cities and fertile land and took possession of well-supplied houses, cisterns cut out of rock, vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. They ate, were filled, became prosperous, and delighted in Your great goodness."
Nehemiah,9,26,But they were disobedient and rebelled against You. They flung Your law behind their backs and killed Your prophets who warned them in order to turn them back to You. They committed terrible blasphemies.
Nehemiah,9,27,"So You handed them over to their enemies, who oppressed them. In their time of distress, they cried out to You, and You heard from heaven. In Your abundant compassion You gave them deliverers, who rescued them from the power of their enemies."
Nehemiah,9,28,"But as soon as they had relief, they again did what was evil in Your sight. So You abandoned them to the power of their enemies, who dominated them. When they cried out to You again, You heard from heaven and rescued them many times in Your compassion."
Nehemiah,9,29,"You warned them to turn back to Your law, but they acted arrogantly and would not obey Your commands. They sinned against Your ordinances, which a person will live by if he does them. They stubbornly resisted, stiffened their necks, and would not obey."
Nehemiah,9,30,"You were patient with them for many years, and Your Spirit warned them through Your prophets, but they would not listen. Therefore, You handed them over to the surrounding peoples."
Nehemiah,9,31,"However, in Your abundant compassion, You did not destroy them or abandon them, for You are a gracious and compassionate God."
Nehemiah,9,32,"So now, our God—the great, mighty, and awe-inspiring God who keeps His gracious covenant— do not view lightly all the hardships that have afflicted us, our kings and leaders, our priests and prophets, our ancestors and all Your people, from the days of the Assyrian kings until today."
Nehemiah,9,33,"You are righteous concerning all that has come on us, because You have acted faithfully, while we have acted wickedly."
Nehemiah,9,34,"Our kings, leaders, priests, and ancestors did not obey Your law or listen to Your commands and warnings You gave them."
Nehemiah,9,35,"When they were in their kingdom, with Your abundant goodness that You gave them, and in the spacious and fertile land You set before them, they would not serve You or turn from their wicked ways."
Nehemiah,9,36,"Here we are today, slaves in the land You gave our ancestors so that they could enjoy its fruit and its goodness. Here we are—slaves in it!"
Nehemiah,9,37,"Its abundant harvest goes to the kings You have set over us, because of our sins. They rule over our bodies and our livestock as they please. We are in great distress."

Nehemiah,12,42,"and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. Then the singers sang, with Jezrahiah as the leader."
Nehemiah,12,43,"On that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced because God had given them great joy. The women and children also celebrated, and Jerusalem’s rejoicing was heard far away."
Nehemiah,12,44,"On that same day men were placed in charge of the rooms that housed the supplies, contributions, firstfruits, and tenths. The legally required portions for the priests and Levites were gathered from the village fields, because Judah was grateful to the priests and Levites who were serving."
Nehemiah,12,45,"They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, along with the singers and gatekeepers, as David and his son Solomon had prescribed."
Nehemiah,12,46,"For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there were leaders of the singers and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God."
Nehemiah,12,47,"So in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, all Israel contributed the daily portions for the singers and gatekeepers. They also set aside daily portions for the Levites, and the Levites set aside daily portions for the descendants of Aaron."
Nehemiah,13,1,"At that time the book of Moses was read publicly to the people. The command was found written in it that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter the assembly of God,"
Nehemiah,13,2,"because they did not meet the Israelites with food and water. Instead, they hired Balaam against them to curse them, but our God turned the curse into a blessing."
Nehemiah,13,3,"When they heard the law, they separated all those of mixed descent from Israel."
Nehemiah,13,4,"Now before this, Eliashib the priest had been put in charge of the storerooms of the house of our God. He was a relative of Tobiah"
Nehemiah,13,5,"and had prepared a large room for him where they had previously stored the grain offerings, the frankincense, the articles, and the tenths of grain, new wine, and oil prescribed for the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers, along with the contributions for the priests."
Nehemiah,13,6,"While all this was happening, I was not in Jerusalem, because I had returned to King Artaxerxes of Babylon in the thirty-second year of his reign. It was only later that I asked the king for a leave of absence"
Nehemiah,13,7,so I could return to Jerusalem. Then I discovered the evil that Eliashib had done on behalf of Tobiah by providing him a room in the courts of God’s house.
Nehemiah,13,8,I was greatly displeased and threw all of Tobiah’s household possessions out of the room.
Nehemiah,13,9,"I ordered that the rooms be purified, and I had the articles of the house of God restored there, along with the grain offering and frankincense."
Nehemiah,13,10,"I also found out that because the portions for the Levites had not been given, each of the Levites and the singers performing the service had gone back to his own field."
Nehemiah,13,11,"Therefore, I rebuked the officials, saying, “Why has the house of God been neglected?” I gathered the Levites and singers together and stationed them at their posts."
Nehemiah,13,12,"Then all Judah brought a tenth of the grain, new wine, and oil into the storehouses."
Nehemiah,13,13,"I appointed as treasurers over the storehouses Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites, with Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah to assist them, because they were considered trustworthy. They were responsible for the distribution to their colleagues."
Nehemiah,13,14,"Remember me for this, my God, and don’t erase the deeds of faithful love I have done for the house of my God and for its services."
Nehemiah,13,15,"At that time I saw people in Judah treading wine presses on the Sabbath. They were also bringing in stores of grain and loading them on donkeys, along with wine, grapes, and figs. All kinds of goods were being brought to Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I warned them against selling food on that day."
Nehemiah,13,16,The Tyrians living there were importing fish and all kinds of merchandise and selling them on the Sabbath to the people of Judah in Jerusalem.
Nehemiah,13,17,I rebuked the nobles of Judah and said to them: “What is this evil you are doing—profaning the Sabbath day?
Nehemiah,13,18,"Didn’t your ancestors do the same, so that our God brought all this disaster on us and on this city? And now you are rekindling His anger against Israel by profaning the Sabbath!”"
Nehemiah,13,19,"When shadows began to fall on the gates of Jerusalem just before the Sabbath, I gave orders that the gates be closed and not opened until after the Sabbath. I posted some of my men at the gates, so that no goods could enter during the Sabbath day."
Nehemiah,13,20,"Once or twice the merchants and those who sell all kinds of goods camped outside Jerusalem,"
Nehemiah,13,21,"but I warned them, “Why are you camping in front of the wall? If you do it again, I’ll use force against you.” After that they did not come again on the Sabbath."
Nehemiah,13,22,"Then I instructed the Levites to purify themselves and guard the gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy. Remember me for this also, my God, and look on me with compassion in keeping with Your abundant, faithful love."
Nehemiah,13,23,"In those days I also saw Jews who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab."
Nehemiah,13,24,Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of one of the other peoples but could not speak Hebrew.
Nehemiah,13,25,"I rebuked them, cursed them, beat some of their men, and pulled out their hair. I forced them to take an oath before God and said: “You must not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters as wives for your sons or yourselves!"
Nehemiah,13,26,"Didn’t King Solomon of Israel sin in matters like this? There was not a king like him among many nations. He was loved by his God and God made him king over all Israel, yet foreign women drew him into sin."
Nehemiah,13,27,Why then should we hear about you doing all this terrible evil and acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign women?”
Nehemiah,13,28,"Even one of the sons of Jehoiada, son of Eliashib the high priest, had become a son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite. So I drove him away from me."
Nehemiah,13,29,"Remember them, my God, for defiling the priesthood as well as the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites."
Nehemiah,13,30,So I purified them from everything foreign and assigned specific duties to each of the priests and Levites.
Nehemiah,13,31,"I also arranged for the donation of wood at the appointed times and for the firstfruits. Remember me, my God, with favor."
Esther,1,1,"These events took place during the days of Ahasuerus, who ruled 127 provinces from India to Cush."
Esther,1,2,In those days King Ahasuerus reigned from his royal throne in the fortress at Susa.
Esther,1,3,"He held a feast in the third year of his reign for all his officials and staff, the army of Persia and Media, the nobles, and the officials from the provinces."
Esther,1,4,He displayed the glorious wealth of his kingdom and the magnificent splendor of his greatness for a total of 180 days.
Esther,1,5,"At the end of this time, the king held a week-long banquet in the garden courtyard of the royal palace for all the people, from the greatest to the least, who were present in the fortress of Susa."
Esther,1,6,"White and violet linen hangings were fastened with fine white and purple linen cords to silver rods on marble columns. Gold and silver couches were arranged on a mosaic pavement of red feldspar, marble, mother-of-pearl, and precious stones."
Esther,1,7,"Beverages were served in an array of gold goblets, each with a different design. Royal wine flowed freely, according to the king’s bounty"
Esther,1,8,and no restraint was placed on the drinking. The king had ordered every wine steward in his household to serve as much as each person wanted.
Esther,1,9,Queen Vashti also gave a feast for the women of King Ahasuerus’s palace.
Esther,1,10,"On the seventh day, when the king was feeling good from the wine, Ahasuerus commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carkas, the seven eunuchs who personally served him,"
Esther,1,11,"to bring Queen Vashti before him with her royal crown. He wanted to show off her beauty to the people and the officials, because she was very beautiful."
Esther,1,12,But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s command that was delivered by his eunuchs. The king became furious and his anger burned within him.
Esther,1,13,"The king consulted the wise men who understood the times, for it was his normal procedure to confer with experts in law and justice."
Esther,1,14,"The most trusted ones were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan. They were the seven officials of Persia and Media who had personal access to the king and occupied the highest positions in the kingdom."
Esther,1,15,"The king asked, “According to the law, what should be done with Queen Vashti, since she refused to obey King Ahasuerus’s command that was delivered by the eunuchs?”"
Esther,1,16,"Memucan said in the presence of the king and his officials, “Queen Vashti has wronged not only the king, but all the officials and the peoples who are in every one of King Ahasuerus’s provinces."
Esther,1,17,"For the queen’s action will become public knowledge to all the women and cause them to despise their husbands and say, ‘King Ahasuerus ordered Queen Vashti brought before him, but she did not come.’"
Esther,1,18,"Before this day is over, the noble women of Persia and Media who hear about the queen’s act will say the same thing to all the king’s officials, resulting in more contempt and fury."
Esther,1,19,"“If it meets the king’s approval, he should personally issue a royal decree. Let it be recorded in the laws of Persia and Media, so that it cannot be revoked: Vashti is not to enter King Ahasuerus’s presence, and her royal position is to be given to another woman who is more worthy than she."
Esther,1,20,"The decree the king issues will be heard throughout his vast kingdom, so all women will honor their husbands, from the least to the greatest.”"
Esther,1,21,"The king and his counselors approved the proposal, and he followed Memucan’s advice."
Esther,1,22,"He sent letters to all the royal provinces, to each province in its own script and to each ethnic group in its own language, that every man should be master of his own house and speak in the language of his own people."
Esther,2,1,"Some time later, when King Ahasuerus’s rage had cooled down, he remembered Vashti, what she had done, and what was decided against her."
Esther,2,2,"The king’s personal attendants suggested, “Let a search be made for beautiful young women for the king."
Esther,2,3,"Let the king appoint commissioners in each province of his kingdom, so that they may assemble all the beautiful young women to the harem at the fortress of Susa. Put them under the care of Hegai, the king’s eunuch, who is in charge of the women, and give them the required beauty treatments."
Esther,2,4,"Then the young woman who pleases the king will become queen instead of Vashti.” This suggestion pleased the king, and he did accordingly."
Esther,2,5,"In the fortress of Susa, there was a Jewish man named Mordecai son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjaminite."
Esther,2,6,He had been taken into exile from Jerusalem with the other captives when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon took King Jeconiah of Judah into exile.
Esther,2,7,"Mordecai was the legal guardian of his cousin Hadassah (that is, Esther), because she didn’t have a father or mother. The young woman had a beautiful figure and was extremely good-looking. When her father and mother died, Mordecai had adopted her as his own daughter."
Esther,2,8,"When the king’s command and edict became public knowledge, many young women gathered at the fortress of Susa under Hegai’s care. Esther was also taken to the palace and placed under the care of Hegai, who was in charge of the women."
Esther,2,9,The young woman pleased him and gained his favor so that he accelerated the process of the beauty treatments and the special diet that she received. He assigned seven hand-picked female servants to her from the palace and transferred her and her servants to the harem’s best quarters.
Esther,2,10,"Esther did not reveal her ethnic background or her birthplace, because Mordecai had ordered her not to."
Esther,2,11,Every day Mordecai took a walk in front of the harem’s courtyard to learn how Esther was doing and to see what was happening to her.
Esther,2,12,"During the year before each young woman’s turn to go to King Ahasuerus, the harem regulation required her to receive beauty treatments with oil of myrrh for six months and then with perfumes and cosmetics for another six months."
Esther,2,13,"When the young woman would go to the king, she was given whatever she requested to take with her from the harem to the palace."
Esther,2,14,"She would go in the evening, and in the morning she would return to a second harem under the supervision of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch in charge of the concubines. She never went to the king again, unless he desired her and summoned her by name."
Esther,2,15,"Esther was the daughter of Abihail, the uncle of Mordecai who had adopted her as his own daughter. When her turn came to go to the king, she did not ask for anything except what Hegai, the king’s trusted official in charge of the harem, suggested. Esther won approval in the sight of everyone who saw her."
Esther,2,16,"She was taken to King Ahasuerus in the royal palace in the tenth month, the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign."
Esther,2,17,The king loved Esther more than all the other women. She won more favor and approval from him than did any of the other young women. He placed the royal crown on her head and made her queen in place of Vashti.
Esther,2,18,The king held a great banquet for all his officials and staff. It was Esther’s banquet. He freed his provinces from tax payments and gave gifts worthy of the king’s bounty.
Esther,2,19,"When the young women were assembled together for a second time, Mordecai was sitting at the King’s Gate."
Esther,2,20,"Esther still had not revealed her birthplace or her ethnic background, as Mordecai had directed. She obeyed Mordecai’s orders, as she always had while he raised her."
Esther,2,21,"During those days while Mordecai was sitting at the King’s Gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two eunuchs who guarded the king’s entrance, became infuriated and planned to assassinate King Ahasuerus."
Esther,2,22,"When Mordecai learned of the plot, he reported it to Queen Esther, and she told the king on Mordecai’s behalf."
Esther,2,23,"When the report was investigated and verified, both men were hanged on the gallows. This event was recorded in the Historical Record in the king’s presence."
Esther,3,1,"After all this took place, King Ahasuerus honored Haman, son of Hammedatha the Agagite. He promoted him in rank and gave him a higher position than all the other officials."
Esther,3,2,"The entire royal staff at the King’s Gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman, because the king had commanded this to be done for him. But Mordecai would not bow down or pay homage."
Esther,3,3,"The members of the royal staff at the King’s Gate asked Mordecai, “Why are you disobeying the king’s command?”"
Esther,3,4,"When they had warned him day after day and he still would not listen to them, they told Haman to see if Mordecai’s actions would be tolerated, since he had told them he was a Jew."
Esther,3,5,"When Haman saw that Mordecai was not bowing down or paying him homage, he was filled with rage."
Esther,3,6,"And when he learned of Mordecai’s ethnic identity, Haman decided not to do away with Mordecai alone. He planned to destroy all of Mordecai’s people, the Jews, throughout Ahasuerus’s kingdom."
Esther,3,7,"In the first month, the month of Nisan, in King Ahasuerus’s twelfth year, Pur (that is, the lot) was cast before Haman for each day in each month, and it fell on the twelfth month, the month Adar."
Esther,3,8,"Then Haman informed King Ahasuerus, “There is one ethnic group, scattered throughout the peoples in every province of your kingdom, yet living in isolation. Their laws are different from everyone else’s and they do not obey the king’s laws. It is not in the king’s best interest to tolerate them."
Esther,3,9,"If the king approves, let an order be drawn up authorizing their destruction, and I will pay 375 tons of silver to the accountants for deposit in the royal treasury.”"
Esther,3,10,"The king removed his signet ring from his finger and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jewish people."
Esther,3,11,"Then the king told Haman, “The money and people are given to you to do with as you see fit.”"
Esther,3,12,"The royal scribes were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and the order was written exactly as Haman commanded. It was intended for the royal satraps, the governors of each of the provinces, and the officials of each ethnic group and written for each province in its own script and to each ethnic group in its own language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the royal signet ring."
Esther,3,13,"Letters were sent by couriers to each of the royal provinces telling the officials to destroy, kill, and annihilate all the Jewish people—young and old, women and children—and plunder their possessions on a single day, the thirteenth day of Adar, the twelfth month."
Esther,3,14,"A copy of the text, issued as law throughout every province, was distributed to all the peoples so that they might get ready for that day."
Esther,3,15,"The couriers left, spurred on by royal command, and the law was issued in the fortress of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink, while the city of Susa was in confusion."
Esther,4,1,"When Mordecai learned all that had occurred, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, went into the middle of the city, and cried loudly and bitterly."
Esther,4,2,"He only went as far as the King’s Gate, since the law prohibited anyone wearing sackcloth from entering the King’s Gate."
Esther,4,3,"There was great mourning among the Jewish people in every province where the king’s command and edict came. They fasted, wept, and lamented, and many lay on sackcloth and ashes."
Esther,4,4,"Esther’s female servants and her eunuchs came and reported the news to her, and the queen was overcome with fear. She sent clothes for Mordecai to wear so he could take off his sackcloth, but he did not accept them."
Esther,4,5,"Esther summoned Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs assigned to her, and dispatched him to Mordecai to learn what he was doing and why."
Esther,4,6,So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the city square in front of the King’s Gate.
Esther,4,7,Mordecai told him everything that had happened as well as the exact amount of money Haman had promised to pay the royal treasury for the slaughter of the Jews.
Esther,4,8,"Mordecai also gave him a copy of the written decree issued in Susa ordering their destruction, so that Hathach might show it to Esther, explain it to her, and command her to approach the king, implore his favor, and plead with him personally for her people."
Esther,4,9,Hathach came and repeated Mordecai’s response to Esther.
Esther,4,10,"Esther spoke to Hathach and commanded him to tell Mordecai,"
Esther,4,11,“All the royal officials and the people of the royal provinces know that one law applies to every man or woman who approaches the king in the inner courtyard and who has not been summoned—the death penalty. Only if the king extends the gold scepter will that person live. I have not been summoned to appear before the king for the last 30 days.”
Esther,4,12,Esther’s response was reported to Mordecai.
Esther,4,13,"Mordecai told the messenger to reply to Esther, “Don’t think that you will escape the fate of all the Jews because you are in the king’s palace."
Esther,4,14,"If you keep silent at this time, liberation and deliverance will come to the Jewish people from another place, but you and your father’s house will be destroyed. Who knows, perhaps you have come to your royal position for such a time as this.”"
Esther,4,15,Esther sent this reply to Mordecai:
Esther,4,16,"“Go and assemble all the Jews who can be found in Susa and fast for me. Don’t eat or drink for three days, day or night. I and my female servants will also fast in the same way. After that, I will go to the king even if it is against the law. If I perish, I perish.”"
Esther,4,17,So Mordecai went and did everything Esther had ordered him.
Esther,5,1,"On the third day, Esther dressed up in her royal clothing and stood in the inner courtyard of the palace facing it. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the royal courtroom, facing its entrance."
Esther,5,2,"As soon as the king saw Queen Esther standing in the courtyard, she won his approval. The king extended the gold scepter in his hand toward Esther, and she approached and touched the tip of the scepter."
Esther,5,3,"“What is it, Queen Esther?” the king asked her. “Whatever you want, even to half the kingdom, will be given to you.”"
Esther,5,4,"“If it pleases the king,” Esther replied, “may the king and Haman come today to the banquet I have prepared for them.”"
Esther,5,5,"The king commanded, “Hurry, and get Haman so we can do as Esther has requested.” So the king and Haman went to the banquet Esther had prepared."
Esther,5,6,"While drinking the wine, the king asked Esther, “Whatever you ask will be given to you. Whatever you want, even to half the kingdom, will be done.”"
Esther,5,7,"Esther answered, “This is my petition and my request:"
Esther,5,8,"If the king approves of me and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and perform my request, may the king and Haman come to the banquet I will prepare for them. Tomorrow I will do what the king has asked.”"
Esther,5,9,"That day Haman left full of joy and in good spirits. But when Haman saw Mordecai at the King’s Gate, and Mordecai didn’t rise or tremble in fear at his presence, Haman was filled with rage toward Mordecai."
Esther,5,10,Yet Haman controlled himself and went home. He sent for his friends and his wife Zeresh to join him.
Esther,5,11,Then Haman described for them his glorious wealth and his many sons. He told them all how the king had honored him and promoted him in rank over the other officials and the royal staff.
Esther,5,12,"“What’s more,” Haman added, “Queen Esther invited no one but me to join the king at the banquet she had prepared. I am invited again tomorrow to join her with the king."
Esther,5,13,"Still, none of this satisfies me since I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the King’s Gate all the time.”"
Esther,5,14,"His wife Zeresh and all his friends told him, “Have them build a gallows 75 feet high. Ask the king in the morning to hang Mordecai on it. Then go to the banquet with the king and enjoy yourself.” The advice pleased Haman, so he had the gallows constructed."
Esther,6,1,"That night sleep escaped the king, so he ordered the book recording daily events to be brought and read to the king."
Esther,6,2,"They found the written report of how Mordecai had informed on Bigthana and Teresh, two eunuchs who guarded the king’s entrance, when they planned to assassinate King Ahasuerus."
Esther,6,3,"The king inquired, “What honor and special recognition have been given to Mordecai for this act?” The king’s personal attendants replied, “Nothing has been done for him.”"
Esther,6,4,"The king asked, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman was just entering the outer court of the palace to ask the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows he had prepared for him."
Esther,6,5,"The king’s attendants answered him, “Haman is there, standing in the court.” “Have him enter,” the king ordered."
Esther,6,6,"Haman entered, and the king asked him, “What should be done for the man the king wants to honor?” Haman thought to himself, “Who is it the king would want to honor more than me?”"
Esther,6,7,"Haman told the king, “For the man the king wants to honor:"
Esther,6,8,"Have them bring a royal garment that the king himself has worn and a horse the king himself has ridden, which has a royal diadem on its head."
Esther,6,9,"Put the garment and the horse under the charge of one of the king’s most noble officials. Have them clothe the man the king wants to honor, parade him on the horse through the city square, and proclaim before him, ‘This is what is done for the man the king wants to honor.’”"
Esther,6,10,"The king told Haman, “Hurry, and do just as you proposed. Take a garment and a horse for Mordecai the Jew, who is sitting at the King’s Gate. Do not leave out anything you have suggested.”"
Esther,6,11,"So Haman took the garment and the horse. He clothed Mordecai and paraded him through the city square, crying out before him, “This is what is done for the man the king wants to honor.”"
Esther,6,12,"Then Mordecai returned to the King’s Gate, but Haman, overwhelmed, hurried off for home with his head covered."
Esther,6,13,"Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened. His advisers and his wife Zeresh said to him, “Since Mordecai is Jewish, and you have begun to fall before him, you won’t overcome him, because your downfall is certain.”"
Esther,6,14,"While they were still speaking with him, the eunuchs of the king arrived and rushed Haman to the banquet Esther had prepared."
Esther,7,1,The king and Haman came to feast with Esther the queen.
Esther,7,2,"Once again, on the second day while drinking wine, the king asked Esther, “Queen Esther, whatever you ask will be given to you. Whatever you seek, even to half the kingdom, will be done.”"
Esther,7,3,"Queen Esther answered, “If I have obtained your approval, my king, and if the king is pleased, spare my life—this is my request; and spare my people—this is my desire."
Esther,7,4,"For my people and I have been sold out to destruction, death, and extermination. If we had merely been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept silent. Indeed, the trouble wouldn’t be worth burdening the king.”"
Esther,7,5,"King Ahasuerus spoke up and asked Queen Esther, “Who is this, and where is the one who would devise such a scheme?”"
Esther,7,6,"Esther answered, “The adversary and enemy is this evil Haman.” Haman stood terrified before the king and queen."
Esther,7,7,"Angered by this, the king arose from where they were drinking wine and went to the palace garden. Haman remained to beg Queen Esther for his life because he realized the king was planning something terrible for him."
Esther,7,8,"Just as the king returned from the palace garden to the house of wine drinking, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was reclining. The king exclaimed, “Would he actually violate the queen while I am in the palace?” As soon as the statement left the king’s mouth, Haman’s face was covered."
Esther,7,9,"Harbona, one of the royal eunuchs, said: “There is a gallows 75 feet tall at Haman’s house that he made for Mordecai, who gave the report that saved the king.” The king commanded, “Hang him on it.”"
Esther,7,10,They hanged Haman on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king’s anger subsided.
Esther,8,1,"That same day King Ahasuerus awarded Queen Esther the estate of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. Mordecai entered the king’s presence because Esther had revealed her relationship to Mordecai."
Esther,8,2,"The king removed his signet ring he had recovered from Haman and gave it to Mordecai, and Esther put him in charge of Haman’s estate."
Esther,8,3,"Then Esther addressed the king again. She fell at his feet, wept, and begged him to revoke the evil of Haman the Agagite, and his plot he had devised against the Jews."
Esther,8,4,"The king extended the gold scepter toward Esther, so she got up and stood before the king."
Esther,8,5,"She said, “If it pleases the king, and I have found approval before him, if the matter seems right to the king and I am pleasing in his sight, let a royal edict be written. Let it revoke the documents the scheming Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the king’s provinces."
Esther,8,6,For how could I bear to see the disaster that would come on my people? How could I bear to see the destruction of my relatives?”
Esther,8,7,"King Ahasuerus said to Esther the Queen and to Mordecai the Jew, “Look, I have given Haman’s estate to Esther, and he was hanged on the gallows because he attacked the Jews."
Esther,8,8,"You may write in the king’s name whatever pleases you concerning the Jews, and seal it with the royal signet ring. A document written in the king’s name and sealed with the royal signet ring cannot be revoked.”"
Esther,8,9,"On the twenty-third day of the third month (that is, the month Sivan), the royal scribes were summoned. Everything was written exactly as Mordecai ordered for the Jews, to the satraps, the governors, and the officials of the 127 provinces from India to Cush. The edict was written for each province in its own script, for each ethnic group in its own language, and to the Jews in their own script and language."
Esther,8,10,"Mordecai wrote in King Ahasuerus’s name and sealed the edicts with the royal signet ring. He sent the documents by mounted couriers, who rode fast horses bred from the royal racing mares."
Esther,8,11,"The king’s edict gave the Jews in each and every city the right to assemble and defend themselves, to destroy, kill, and annihilate every ethnic and provincial army hostile to them, including women and children, and to take their possessions as spoils of war."
Esther,8,12,"This would take place on a single day throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month Adar."
Esther,8,13,"A copy of the text, issued as law throughout every province, was distributed to all the peoples so the Jews could be ready to avenge themselves against their enemies on that day."
Esther,8,14,The couriers rode out in haste on their royal horses at the king’s urgent command. The law was also issued in the fortress of Susa.
Esther,8,15,"Mordecai went from the king’s presence clothed in royal purple and white, with a great gold crown and a purple robe of fine linen. The city of Susa shouted and rejoiced,"
Esther,8,16,"and the Jews celebrated with gladness, joy, and honor."
Esther,8,17,"In every province and every city, wherever the king’s command and his law reached, joy and rejoicing took place among the Jews. There was a celebration and a holiday. And many of the ethnic groups of the land professed themselves to be Jews because fear of the Jews had overcome them."
Esther,9,1,"The king’s command and law went into effect on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month Adar. On the day when the Jews’ enemies had hoped to overpower them, just the opposite happened. The Jews overpowered those who hated them."
Esther,9,2,In each of King Ahasuerus’s provinces the Jews assembled in their cities to attack those who intended to harm them. Not a single person could withstand them; terror of them fell on every nationality.
Esther,9,3,"All the officials of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and the royal civil administrators aided the Jews because they were afraid of Mordecai."
Esther,9,4,"For Mordecai exercised great power in the palace, and his fame spread throughout the provinces as he became more and more powerful."
Esther,9,5,"The Jews put all their enemies to the sword, killing and destroying them. They did what they pleased to those who hated them."
Esther,9,6,"In the fortress of Susa the Jews killed and destroyed 500 men,"
Esther,9,7,"including Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,"
Esther,9,8,"Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,"
Esther,9,9,"Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha."
Esther,9,10,"They killed these 10 sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. However, they did not seize any plunder."
Esther,9,11,On that day the number of people killed in the fortress of Susa was reported to the king.
Esther,9,12,"The king said to Queen Esther, “In the fortress of Susa the Jews have killed and destroyed 500 men, including Haman’s 10 sons. What have they done in the rest of the royal provinces? Whatever you ask will be given to you. Whatever you seek will also be done.”"
Esther,9,13,"Esther answered, “If it pleases the king, may the Jews who are in Susa also have tomorrow to carry out today’s law, and may the bodies of Haman’s 10 sons be hung on the gallows.”"
Esther,9,14,"The king gave the orders for this to be done, so a law was announced in Susa, and they hung the bodies of Haman’s 10 sons."
Esther,9,15,"The Jews in Susa assembled again on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and killed 300 men in Susa, but they did not seize any plunder."
Esther,9,16,"The rest of the Jews in the royal provinces assembled, defended themselves, and got rid of their enemies. They killed 75,000 of those who hated them, but they did not seize any plunder."
Esther,9,17,"They fought on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar and rested on the fourteenth, and it became a day of feasting and rejoicing."
Esther,9,18,"But the Jews in Susa had assembled on the thirteenth and the fourteenth days of the month. They rested on the fifteenth day of the month, and it became a day of feasting and rejoicing."
Esther,9,19,This explains why the rural Jews who live in villages observe the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a time of rejoicing and feasting. It is a holiday when they send gifts to one another.
Esther,9,20,"Mordecai recorded these events and sent letters to all the Jews in all of King Ahasuerus’s provinces, both near and far."
Esther,9,21,He ordered them to celebrate the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month Adar every year
Esther,9,22,"because during those days the Jews got rid of their enemies. That was the month when their sorrow was turned into rejoicing and their mourning into a holiday. They were to be days of feasting, rejoicing, and of sending gifts to one another and the poor."
Esther,9,23,"So the Jews agreed to continue the practice they had begun, as Mordecai had written them to do."
Esther,9,24,"For Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them. He cast the Pur (that is, the lot) to crush and destroy them."
Esther,9,25,"But when the matter was brought before the king, he commanded by letter that the evil plan Haman had devised against the Jews return on his own head and that he should be hanged with his sons on the gallows."
Esther,9,26,"For this reason these days are called Purim, from the word Pur. Because of all the instructions in this letter as well as what they had witnessed and what had happened to them,"
Esther,9,27,"the Jews bound themselves, their descendants, and all who joined with them to a commitment that they would not fail to celebrate these two days each and every year according to the written instructions and according to the time appointed."
Esther,9,28,"These days are remembered and celebrated by every generation, family, province, and city, so that these days of Purim will not lose their significance in Jewish life and their memory will not fade from their descendants."
Esther,9,29,"Queen Esther daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote this second letter with full authority to confirm the letter about Purim."
Esther,9,30,"He sent letters with messages of peace and faithfulness to all the Jews who were in the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus,"
Esther,9,31,in order to confirm these days of Purim at their proper time just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established them and just as they had committed themselves and their descendants to the practices of fasting and lamentation.
Esther,9,32,"So Esther’s command confirmed these customs of Purim, which were then written into the record."
Esther,10,1,King Ahasuerus imposed a tax throughout the land even to the farthest shores.
Esther,10,2,"All of his powerful and magnificent accomplishments and the detailed account of Mordecai’s great rank to which the king had honored him, have they not been written in the Historical Records of the Kings of Media and Persia?"
Esther,10,3,"Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus, famous among the Jews, and highly popular with many of his relatives. He continued to seek good for his people and to speak for the welfare of all his descendants."

Proverbs,30,7,Two things I ask of You; don’t deny them to me before I die:
Proverbs,30,8,Keep falsehood and deceitful words far from me. Give me neither poverty nor wealth; feed me with the food I need.
Proverbs,30,9,"Otherwise, I might have too much and deny You, saying, “Who is the LORD?” or I might have nothing and steal, profaning the name of my God."
Proverbs,30,10,"Don’t slander a servant to his master or he will curse you, and you will become guilty."
Proverbs,30,11,There is a generation that curses its father and does not bless its mother.
Proverbs,30,12,"There is a generation that is pure in its own eyes, yet is not washed from its filth."
Proverbs,30,13,There is a generation—how haughty its eyes and pretentious its looks.
Proverbs,30,14,"There is a generation whose teeth are swords, whose fangs are knives, devouring the oppressed from the land and the needy from among mankind."
Proverbs,30,15,"The leech has two daughters: “Give, Give!” Three things are never satisfied; four never say, “Enough!”:"
Proverbs,30,16,"Sheol; a childless womb; earth, which is never satisfied with water; and fire, which never says, “Enough!”"
Proverbs,30,17,"As for the eye that ridicules a father and despises obedience to a mother, may ravens of the valley pluck it out and young vultures eat it."
Proverbs,30,18,Three things are beyond me; four I can’t understand:
Proverbs,30,19,"the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship at sea, and the way of a man with a young woman."
Proverbs,30,20,"This is the way of an adulteress: she eats and wipes her mouth and says, “I’ve done nothing wrong.”"
Proverbs,30,21,The earth trembles under three things; it cannot bear up under four:
Proverbs,30,22,"a servant when he becomes king, a fool when he is stuffed with food,"
Proverbs,30,23,"an unloved woman when she marries, and a servant girl when she ousts her queen."
Proverbs,30,24,"Four things on earth are small, yet they are extremely wise:"
Proverbs,30,25,"the ants are not a strong people, yet they store up their food in the summer;"
Proverbs,30,26,"hyraxes are not a mighty people, yet they make their homes in the cliffs;"
Proverbs,30,27,"locusts have no king, yet all of them march in ranks;"
Proverbs,30,28,"a lizard can be caught in your hands, yet it lives in kings’ palaces."
Proverbs,30,29,"Three things are stately in their stride, even four are stately in their walk:"
Proverbs,30,30,"a lion, which is mightiest among beasts and doesn’t retreat before anything,"
Proverbs,30,31,"a strutting rooster, a goat, and a king at the head of his army."
Proverbs,30,32,"If you have been foolish by exalting yourself or if you’ve been scheming, put your hand over your mouth."
Proverbs,30,33,"For the churning of milk produces butter, and twisting a nose draws blood, and stirring up anger produces strife."
Proverbs,31,1,"The words of King Lemuel, an oracle that his mother taught him:"
Proverbs,31,2,"What should I say, my son? What, son of my womb? What, son of my vows?"
Proverbs,31,3,Don’t spend your energy on women or your efforts on those who destroy kings.
Proverbs,31,4,"It is not for kings, Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine or for rulers to desire beer."
Proverbs,31,5,"Otherwise, they will drink, forget what is decreed, and pervert justice for all the oppressed."
Proverbs,31,6,Give beer to one who is dying and wine to one whose life is bitter.
Proverbs,31,7,Let him drink so that he can forget his poverty and remember his trouble no more.
Proverbs,31,8,"Speak up for those who have no voice, for the justice of all who are dispossessed."
Proverbs,31,9,"Speak up, judge righteously, and defend the cause of the oppressed and needy."
Proverbs,31,10,Who can find a capable wife? She is far more precious than jewels.
Proverbs,31,11,"The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will not lack anything good."
Proverbs,31,12,"She rewards him with good, not evil, all the days of her life."
Proverbs,31,13,She selects wool and flax and works with willing hands.
Proverbs,31,14,"She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from far away."
Proverbs,31,15,She rises while it is still night and provides food for her household and portions for her female servants.
Proverbs,31,16,She evaluates a field and buys it; she plants a vineyard with her earnings.
Proverbs,31,17,She draws on her strength and reveals that her arms are strong.
Proverbs,31,18,"She sees that her profits are good, and her lamp never goes out at night."
Proverbs,31,19,"She extends her hands to the spinning staff, and her hands hold the spindle."
Proverbs,31,20,"Her hands reach out to the poor, and she extends her hands to the needy."
Proverbs,31,21,"She is not afraid for her household when it snows, for all in her household are doubly clothed."
Proverbs,31,22,She makes her own bed coverings; her clothing is fine linen and purple.
Proverbs,31,23,"Her husband is known at the city gates, where he sits among the elders of the land."
Proverbs,31,24,She makes and sells linen garments; she delivers belts to the merchants.
Proverbs,31,25,"Strength and honor are her clothing, and she can laugh at the time to come."
Proverbs,31,26,She opens her mouth with wisdom and loving instruction is on her tongue.
Proverbs,31,27,She watches over the activities of her household and is never idle.
Proverbs,31,28,Her sons rise up and call her blessed. Her husband also praises her:
Proverbs,31,29,"“Many women are capable, but you surpass them all!”"
Proverbs,31,30,"Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting, but a woman who fears the LORD will be praised."
Proverbs,31,31,"Give her the reward of her labor, and let her works praise her at the city gates."
Ecclesiastes,1,1,"The words of the Teacher, son of David, king in Jerusalem."
Ecclesiastes,1,2,"“Absolute futility,” says the Teacher. “Absolute futility. Everything is futile.”"
Ecclesiastes,1,3,What does a man gain for all his efforts that he labors at under the sun?
Ecclesiastes,1,4,"A generation goes and a generation comes, but the earth remains forever."
Ecclesiastes,1,5,"The sun rises and the sun sets; panting, it returns to its place where it rises."
Ecclesiastes,1,6,"Gusting to the south, turning to the north, turning, turning, goes the wind, and the wind returns in its cycles."
Ecclesiastes,1,7,"All the streams flow to the sea, yet the sea is never full. The streams are flowing to the place, and they flow there again."
Ecclesiastes,1,8,All things are wearisome; man is unable to speak. The eye is not satisfied by seeing or the ear filled with hearing.
Ecclesiastes,1,9,"What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done; there is nothing new under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,1,10,"Can one say about anything, “Look, this is new”? It has already existed in the ages before us."
Ecclesiastes,1,11,There is no remembrance of those who came before; and of those who will come after there will also be no remembrance by those who follow them.
Ecclesiastes,1,12,"I, the Teacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem."
Ecclesiastes,1,13,I applied my mind to seek and explore through wisdom all that is done under heaven. God has given people this miserable task to keep them occupied.
Ecclesiastes,1,14,"I have seen all the things that are done under the sun and have found everything to be futile, a pursuit of the wind."
Ecclesiastes,1,15,What is crooked cannot be straightened; what is lacking cannot be counted.
Ecclesiastes,1,16,"I said to myself, “Look, I have amassed wisdom far beyond all those who were over Jerusalem before me, and my mind has thoroughly grasped wisdom and knowledge.”"
Ecclesiastes,1,17,"I applied my mind to know wisdom and knowledge, madness and folly; I learned that this too is a pursuit of the wind."
Ecclesiastes,1,18,"For with much wisdom is much sorrow; as knowledge increases, grief increases."
Ecclesiastes,2,1,"I said to myself, “Go ahead, I will test you with pleasure; enjoy what is good.” But it turned out to be futile."
Ecclesiastes,2,2,"I said about laughter, “It is madness,” and about pleasure, “What does this accomplish?”"
Ecclesiastes,2,3,I explored with my mind how to let my body enjoy life with wine and how to grasp folly—my mind still guiding me with wisdom—until I could see what is good for people to do under heaven during the few days of their lives.
Ecclesiastes,2,4,I increased my achievements. I built houses and planted vineyards for myself.
Ecclesiastes,2,5,I made gardens and parks for myself and planted every kind of fruit tree in them.
Ecclesiastes,2,6,I constructed reservoirs of water for myself from which to irrigate a grove of flourishing trees.
Ecclesiastes,2,7,"I acquired male and female servants and had slaves who were born in my house. I also owned many herds of cattle and flocks, more than all who were before me in Jerusalem."
Ecclesiastes,2,8,"I also amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I gathered male and female singers for myself, and many concubines, the delights of men."
Ecclesiastes,2,9,So I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem; my wisdom also remained with me.
Ecclesiastes,2,10,"All that my eyes desired, I did not deny them. I did not refuse myself any pleasure, for I took pleasure in all my struggles. This was my reward for all my struggles."
Ecclesiastes,2,11,"When I considered all that I had accomplished and what I had labored to achieve, I found everything to be futile and a pursuit of the wind. There was nothing to be gained under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,2,12,"Then I turned to consider wisdom, madness, and folly, for what will the man be like who comes after the king? He will do what has already been done."
Ecclesiastes,2,13,"And I realized that there is an advantage to wisdom over folly, like the advantage of light over darkness."
Ecclesiastes,2,14,"The wise man has eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. Yet I also knew that one fate comes to them both."
Ecclesiastes,2,15,"So I said to myself, “What happens to the fool will also happen to me. Why then have I been overly wise?” And I said to myself that this is also futile."
Ecclesiastes,2,16,"For, just like the fool, there is no lasting remembrance of the wise man, since in the days to come both will be forgotten. How is it that the wise man dies just like the fool?"
Ecclesiastes,2,17,"Therefore, I hated life because the work that was done under the sun was distressing to me. For everything is futile and a pursuit of the wind."
Ecclesiastes,2,18,I hated all my work that I labored at under the sun because I must leave it to the man who comes after me.
Ecclesiastes,2,19,And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will take over all my work that I labored at skillfully under the sun. This too is futile.
Ecclesiastes,2,20,So I began to give myself over to despair concerning all my work that I had labored at under the sun.
Ecclesiastes,2,21,"When there is a man whose work was done with wisdom, knowledge, and skill, and he must give his portion to a man who has not worked for it, this too is futile and a great wrong."
Ecclesiastes,2,22,For what does a man get with all his work and all his efforts that he labors at under the sun?
Ecclesiastes,2,23,"For all his days are filled with grief, and his occupation is sorrowful; even at night, his mind does not rest. This too is futile."
Ecclesiastes,2,24,"There is nothing better for man than to eat, drink, and enjoy his work. I have seen that even this is from God’s hand,"
Ecclesiastes,2,25,because who can eat and who can enjoy life apart from Him?
Ecclesiastes,2,26,"For to the man who is pleasing in His sight, He gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy, but to the sinner He gives the task of gathering and accumulating in order to give to the one who is pleasing in God’s sight. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind."
Ecclesiastes,3,1,"There is an occasion for everything, and a time for every activity under heaven:"
Ecclesiastes,3,2,a time to give birth and a time to die; a time to plant and a time to uproot;
Ecclesiastes,3,3,a time to kill and a time to heal; a time to tear down and a time to build;
Ecclesiastes,3,4,a time to weep and a time to laugh; a time to mourn and a time to dance;
Ecclesiastes,3,5,a time to throw stones and a time to gather stones; a time to embrace and a time to avoid embracing;
Ecclesiastes,3,6,a time to search and a time to count as lost; a time to keep and a time to throw away;
Ecclesiastes,3,7,a time to tear and a time to sew; a time to be silent and a time to speak;
Ecclesiastes,3,8,a time to love and a time to hate; a time for war and a time for peace.
Ecclesiastes,3,9,What does the worker gain from his struggles?
Ecclesiastes,3,10,I have seen the task that God has given people to keep them occupied.
Ecclesiastes,3,11,"He has made everything appropriate in its time. He has also put eternity in their hearts, but man cannot discover the work God has done from beginning to end."
Ecclesiastes,3,12,I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and enjoy the good life.
Ecclesiastes,3,13,"It is also the gift of God whenever anyone eats, drinks, and enjoys all his efforts."
Ecclesiastes,3,14,I know that all God does will last forever; there is no adding to it or taking from it. God works so that people will be in awe of Him.
Ecclesiastes,3,15,"Whatever is, has already been, and whatever will be, already is. God repeats what has passed."
Ecclesiastes,3,16,I also observed under the sun: there is wickedness at the place of judgment and there is wickedness at the place of righteousness.
Ecclesiastes,3,17,"I said to myself, “God will judge the righteous and the wicked, since there is a time for every activity and every work.”"
Ecclesiastes,3,18,"I said to myself, “This happens concerning people, so that God may test them and they may see for themselves that they are like animals.”"
Ecclesiastes,3,19,"For the fate of people and the fate of animals is the same. As one dies, so dies the other; they all have the same breath. People have no advantage over animals since everything is futile."
Ecclesiastes,3,20,"All are going to the same place; all come from dust, and all return to dust."
Ecclesiastes,3,21,Who knows if the spirit of people rises upward and the spirit of animals goes downward to the earth?
Ecclesiastes,3,22,I have seen that there is nothing better than for a person to enjoy his activities because that is his reward. For who can enable him to see what will happen after he dies?
Ecclesiastes,4,1,"Again, I observed all the acts of oppression being done under the sun. Look at the tears of those who are oppressed; they have no one to comfort them. Power is with those who oppress them; they have no one to comfort them."
Ecclesiastes,4,2,"So I admired the dead, who have already died, more than the living, who are still alive."
Ecclesiastes,4,3,"But better than either of them is the one who has not yet existed, who has not seen the evil activity that is done under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,4,4,I saw that all labor and all skillful work is due to a man’s jealousy of his friend. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.
Ecclesiastes,4,5,The fool folds his arms and consumes his own flesh.
Ecclesiastes,4,6,Better one handful with rest than two handfuls with effort and a pursuit of the wind.
Ecclesiastes,4,7,"Again, I saw futility under the sun:"
Ecclesiastes,4,8,"There is a person without a companion, without even a son or brother, and though there is no end to all his struggles, his eyes are still not content with riches. “So who am I struggling for,” he asks, “and depriving myself from good?” This too is futile and a miserable task."
Ecclesiastes,4,9,Two are better than one because they have a good reward for their efforts.
Ecclesiastes,4,10,"For if either falls, his companion can lift him up; but pity the one who falls without another to lift him up."
Ecclesiastes,4,11,"Also, if two lie down together, they can keep warm; but how can one person alone keep warm?"
Ecclesiastes,4,12,"And if someone overpowers one person, two can resist him. A cord of three strands is not easily broken."
Ecclesiastes,4,13,Better is a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer pays attention to warnings.
Ecclesiastes,4,14,"For he came from prison to be king, even though he was born poor in his kingdom."
Ecclesiastes,4,15,"I saw all the living, who move about under the sun, follow a second youth who succeeds him."
Ecclesiastes,4,16,"There is no limit to all the people who were before them, yet those who come later will not rejoice in him. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind."
Ecclesiastes,5,1,"Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. Better to draw near in obedience than to offer the sacrifice as fools do, for they ignorantly do wrong."
Ecclesiastes,5,2,"Do not be hasty to speak, and do not be impulsive to make a speech before God. God is in heaven and you are on earth, so let your words be few."
Ecclesiastes,5,3,For dreams result from much work and a fool’s voice from many words.
Ecclesiastes,5,4,"When you make a vow to God, don’t delay fulfilling it, because He does not delight in fools. Fulfill what you vow."
Ecclesiastes,5,5,Better that you do not vow than that you vow and not fulfill it.
Ecclesiastes,5,6,"Do not let your mouth bring guilt on you, and do not say in the presence of the messenger that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry with your words and destroy the work of your hands?"
Ecclesiastes,5,7,"For many dreams bring futility, so do many words. Therefore, fear God."
Ecclesiastes,5,8,"If you see oppression of the poor and perversion of justice and righteousness in the province, don’t be astonished at the situation, because one official protects another official, and higher officials protect them."
Ecclesiastes,5,9,The profit from the land is taken by all; the king is served by the field.
Ecclesiastes,5,10,"The one who loves money is never satisfied with money, and whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with income. This too is futile."
Ecclesiastes,5,11,"When good things increase, the ones who consume them multiply; what, then, is the profit to the owner, except to gaze at them with his eyes?"
Ecclesiastes,5,12,"The sleep of the worker is sweet, whether he eats little or much, but the abundance of the rich permits him no sleep."
Ecclesiastes,5,13,There is a sickening tragedy I have seen under the sun: wealth kept by its owner to his harm.
Ecclesiastes,5,14,"That wealth was lost in a bad venture, so when he fathered a son, he was empty-handed."
Ecclesiastes,5,15,"As he came from his mother’s womb, so he will go again, naked as he came; he will take nothing for his efforts that he can carry in his hands."
Ecclesiastes,5,16,"This too is a sickening tragedy: exactly as he comes, so he will go. What does the one gain who struggles for the wind?"
Ecclesiastes,5,17,"What is more, he eats in darkness all his days, with much sorrow, sickness, and anger."
Ecclesiastes,5,18,"Here is what I have seen to be good: it is appropriate to eat, drink, and experience good in all the labor one does under the sun during the few days of his life God has given him, because that is his reward."
Ecclesiastes,5,19,"God has also given riches and wealth to every man, and He has allowed him to enjoy them, take his reward, and rejoice in his labor. This is a gift of God,"
Ecclesiastes,5,20,for he does not often consider the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with the joy of his heart.
Ecclesiastes,6,1,"Here is a tragedy I have observed under the sun, and it weighs heavily on humanity:"
Ecclesiastes,6,2,"God gives a man riches, wealth, and honor so that he lacks nothing of all he desires for himself, but God does not allow him to enjoy them. Instead, a stranger will enjoy them. This is futile and a sickening tragedy."
Ecclesiastes,6,3,"A man may father a hundred children and live many years. No matter how long he lives, if he is not satisfied by good things and does not even have a proper burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he."
Ecclesiastes,6,4,"For he comes in futility and he goes in darkness, and his name is shrouded in darkness."
Ecclesiastes,6,5,"Though a stillborn child does not see the sun and is not conscious, it has more rest than he."
Ecclesiastes,6,6,"And if he lives a thousand years twice, but does not experience happiness, do not both go to the same place?"
Ecclesiastes,6,7,"All man’s labor is for his stomach, yet the appetite is never satisfied."
Ecclesiastes,6,8,What advantage then does the wise man have over the fool? What advantage is there for the poor person who knows how to conduct himself before others?
Ecclesiastes,6,9,Better what the eyes see than wandering desire. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.
Ecclesiastes,6,10,"Whatever exists was given its name long ago, and it is known what man is. But he is not able to contend with the One stronger than he."
Ecclesiastes,6,11,"For when there are many words, they increase futility. What is the advantage for man?"
Ecclesiastes,6,12,"For who knows what is good for man in life, in the few days of his futile life that he spends like a shadow? Who can tell man what will happen after him under the sun?"
Ecclesiastes,7,1,"A good name is better than fine perfume, and the day of one’s death than the day of one’s birth."
Ecclesiastes,7,2,"It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting, since that is the end of all mankind, and the living should take it to heart."
Ecclesiastes,7,3,"Grief is better than laughter, for when a face is sad, a heart may be glad."
Ecclesiastes,7,4,"The heart of the wise is in a house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in a house of pleasure."
Ecclesiastes,7,5,"It is better to listen to rebuke from a wise person than to listen to the song of fools,"
Ecclesiastes,7,6,"for like the crackling of burning thorns under the pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This too is futile."
Ecclesiastes,7,7,"Surely, the practice of extortion turns a wise person into a fool, and a bribe destroys the mind."
Ecclesiastes,7,8,The end of a matter is better than its beginning; a patient spirit is better than a proud spirit.
Ecclesiastes,7,9,"Don’t let your spirit rush to be angry, for anger abides in the heart of fools."
Ecclesiastes,7,10,"Don’t say, “Why were the former days better than these?” since it is not wise of you to ask this."
Ecclesiastes,7,11,"Wisdom is as good as an inheritance and an advantage to those who see the sun,"
Ecclesiastes,7,12,"because wisdom is protection as money is protection, and the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of its owner."
Ecclesiastes,7,13,"Consider the work of God, for who can straighten out what He has made crooked?"
Ecclesiastes,7,14,"In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity, consider: God has made the one as well as the other, so that man cannot discover anything that will come after him."
Ecclesiastes,7,15,"In my futile life I have seen everything: there is a righteous man who perishes in spite of his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who lives long in spite of his evil."
Ecclesiastes,7,16,"Don’t be excessively righteous, and don’t be overly wise. Why should you destroy yourself?"
Ecclesiastes,7,17,"Don’t be excessively wicked, and don’t be foolish. Why should you die before your time?"
Ecclesiastes,7,18,It is good that you grasp the one and do not let the other slip from your hand. For the one who fears God will end up with both of them.
Ecclesiastes,7,19,Wisdom makes the wise man stronger than ten rulers of a city.
Ecclesiastes,7,20,There is certainly no righteous man on the earth who does good and never sins.
Ecclesiastes,7,21,"Don’t pay attention to everything people say, or you may hear your servant cursing you,"
Ecclesiastes,7,22,for you know that many times you yourself have cursed others.
Ecclesiastes,7,23,"I have tested all this by wisdom. I resolved, “I will be wise,” but it was beyond me."
Ecclesiastes,7,24,What exists is beyond reach and very deep. Who can discover it?
Ecclesiastes,7,25,"I turned my thoughts to know, explore, and seek wisdom and an explanation for things, and to know that wickedness is stupidity and folly is madness."
Ecclesiastes,7,26,"And I find more bitter than death the woman who is a trap, her heart a net, and her hands chains. The one who pleases God will escape her, but the sinner will be captured by her."
Ecclesiastes,7,27,"“Look,” says the Teacher, “I have discovered this by adding one thing to another to find out the explanation,"
Ecclesiastes,7,28,"which my soul continually searches for but does not find: among a thousand people I have found one true man, but among all these I have not found a true woman."
Ecclesiastes,7,29,"Only see this: I have discovered that God made people upright, but they pursued many schemes.”"
Ecclesiastes,8,1,"Who is like the wise person, and who knows the interpretation of a matter? A man’s wisdom brightens his face, and the sternness of his face is changed."
Ecclesiastes,8,2,Keep the king’s command because of your oath made before God.
Ecclesiastes,8,3,"Do not be in a hurry; leave his presence, and don’t persist in a bad cause, since he will do whatever he wants."
Ecclesiastes,8,4,"For the king’s word is authoritative, and who can say to him, “What are you doing?”"
Ecclesiastes,8,5,"The one who keeps a command will not experience anything harmful, and a wise heart knows the right time and procedure."
Ecclesiastes,8,6,"For every activity there is a right time and procedure, even though man’s troubles are heavy on him."
Ecclesiastes,8,7,Yet no one knows what will happen because who can tell him what will happen?
Ecclesiastes,8,8,"No one has authority over the wind to restrain it, and there is no authority over the day of death; there is no furlough in battle, and wickedness will not allow those who practice it to escape."
Ecclesiastes,8,9,"All this I have seen, applying my mind to all the work that is done under the sun, at a time when one man has authority over another to his harm."
Ecclesiastes,8,10,"In such circumstances, I saw the wicked buried. They came and went from the holy place, and they were praised in the city where they did so. This too is futile."
Ecclesiastes,8,11,"Because the sentence against a criminal act is not carried out quickly, the heart of people is filled with the desire to commit crime."
Ecclesiastes,8,12,"Although a sinner commits crime a hundred times and prolongs his life, yet I also know that it will go well with God-fearing people, for they are reverent before Him."
Ecclesiastes,8,13,"However, it will not go well with the wicked, and they will not lengthen their days like a shadow, for they are not reverent before God."
Ecclesiastes,8,14,"There is a futility that is done on the earth: there are righteous people who get what the actions of the wicked deserve, and there are wicked people who get what the actions of the righteous deserve. I say that this too is futile."
Ecclesiastes,8,15,"So I commended enjoyment because there is nothing better for man under the sun than to eat, drink, and enjoy himself, for this will accompany him in his labor during the days of his life that God gives him under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,8,16,"When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe the activity that is done on the earth (even though one’s eyes do not close in sleep day or night),"
Ecclesiastes,8,17,"I observed all the work of God and concluded that man is unable to discover the work that is done under the sun. Even though a man labors hard to explore it, he cannot find it; even if the wise man claims to know it, he is unable to discover it."
Ecclesiastes,9,1,"Indeed, I took all this to heart and explained it all: the righteous, the wise, and their works are in God’s hands.People don’t know whether to expect love or hate. Everything lies ahead of them."
Ecclesiastes,9,2,"Everything is the same for everyone: there is one fate for the righteous and the wicked, for the good and the bad, for the clean and the unclean, for the one who sacrifices and the one who does not sacrifice. As it is for the good, so it is for the sinner; as for the one who takes an oath, so for the one who fears an oath."
Ecclesiastes,9,3,"This is an evil in all that is done under the sun: there is one fate for everyone. In addition, the hearts of people are full of evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live—after that they go to the dead."
Ecclesiastes,9,4,"But there is hope for whoever is joined with all the living, since a live dog is better than a dead lion."
Ecclesiastes,9,5,"For the living know that they will die, but the dead don’t know anything. There is no longer a reward for them because the memory of them is forgotten."
Ecclesiastes,9,6,"Their love, their hate, and their envy have already disappeared, and there is no longer a portion for them in all that is done under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,9,7,"Go, eat your bread with pleasure, and drink your wine with a cheerful heart, for God has already accepted your works."
Ecclesiastes,9,8,"Let your clothes be white all the time, and never let oil be lacking on your head."
Ecclesiastes,9,9,"Enjoy life with the wife you love all the days of your fleeting life, which has been given to you under the sun, all your fleeting days. For that is your portion in life and in your struggle under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,9,10,"Whatever your hands find to do, do with all your strength, because there is no work, planning, knowledge, or wisdom in Sheol where you are going."
Ecclesiastes,9,11,"Again I saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift, or the battle to the strong, or bread to the wise, or riches to the discerning, or favor to the skillful; rather, time and chance happen to all of them."
Ecclesiastes,9,12,"For man certainly does not know his time: like fish caught in a cruel net or like birds caught in a trap, so people are trapped in an evil time as it suddenly falls on them."
