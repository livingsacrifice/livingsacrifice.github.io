Ecclesiastes,2,19,and who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will be master of all for which I toiled and used my wisdom under the sun. This also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes,2,20,"So I turned about and gave my heart up to despair over all the toil of my labors under the sun,"
Ecclesiastes,2,21,because sometimes a person who has toiled with wisdom and knowledge and skill must leave everything to be enjoyed by someone who did not toil for it. This also is vanity and a great evil.
Ecclesiastes,2,22,What has a man from all the toil and striving of heart with which he toils beneath the sun?
Ecclesiastes,2,23,"For all his days are full of sorrow, and his work is a vexation. Even in the night his heart does not rest. This also is vanity."
Ecclesiastes,2,24,"There is nothing better for a person than that he should eat and drink and find enjoyment in his toil. This also, I saw, is from the hand of God,"
Ecclesiastes,2,25,for apart from him who can eat or who can have enjoyment?
Ecclesiastes,2,26,"For to the one who pleases him God has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner he has given the business of gathering and collecting, only to give to one who pleases God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind."
Ecclesiastes,3,1,"For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven:"
Ecclesiastes,3,2,"a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted;"
Ecclesiastes,3,3,"a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;"
Ecclesiastes,3,4,"a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;"
Ecclesiastes,3,5,"a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;"
Ecclesiastes,3,6,"a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;"
Ecclesiastes,3,7,"a time to tear, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;"
Ecclesiastes,3,8,"a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace."
Ecclesiastes,3,9,What gain has the worker from his toil?
Ecclesiastes,3,10,I have seen the business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with.
Ecclesiastes,3,11,"He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also, he has put eternity into man's heart, yet so that he cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end."
Ecclesiastes,3,12,I perceived that there is nothing better for them than to be joyful and to do good as long as they live;
Ecclesiastes,3,13,also that everyone should eat and drink and take pleasure in all his toil--this is God's gift to man.
Ecclesiastes,3,14,"I perceived that whatever God does endures forever; nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it. God has done it, so that people fear before him."
Ecclesiastes,3,15,"That which is, already has been; that which is to be, already has been; and God seeks what has been driven away."
Ecclesiastes,3,16,"Moreover, I saw under the sun that in the place of justice, even there was wickedness, and in the place of righteousness, even there was wickedness."
Ecclesiastes,3,17,"I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time for every matter and for every work."
Ecclesiastes,3,18,I said in my heart with regard to the children of man that God is testing them that they may see that they themselves are but beasts.
Ecclesiastes,3,19,"For what happens to the children of man and what happens to the beasts is the same; as one dies, so dies the other. They all have the same breath, and man has no advantage over the beasts, for all is vanity."
Ecclesiastes,3,20,"All go to one place. All are from the dust, and to dust all return."
Ecclesiastes,3,21,Who knows whether the spirit of man goes upward and the spirit of the beast goes down into the earth?
Ecclesiastes,3,22,"So I saw that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his work, for that is his lot. Who can bring him to see what will be after him?"
Ecclesiastes,4,1,"Again I saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun. And behold, the tears of the oppressed, and they had no one to comfort them! On the side of their oppressors there was power, and there was no one to comfort them."
Ecclesiastes,4,2,And I thought the dead who are already dead more fortunate than the living who are still alive.
Ecclesiastes,4,3,But better than both is he who has not yet been and has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun.
Ecclesiastes,4,4,Then I saw that all toil and all skill in work come from a man's envy of his neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes,4,5,The fool folds his hands and eats his own flesh.
Ecclesiastes,4,6,Better is a handful of quietness than two hands full of toil and a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes,4,7,"Again, I saw vanity under the sun:"
Ecclesiastes,4,8,"one person who has no other, either son or brother, yet there is no end to all his toil, and his eyes are never satisfied with riches, so that he never asks, ""For whom am I toiling and depriving myself of pleasure?"" This also is vanity and an unhappy business."
Ecclesiastes,4,9,"Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil."
Ecclesiastes,4,10,"For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up!"
Ecclesiastes,4,11,"Again, if two lie together, they keep warm, but how can one keep warm alone?"
Ecclesiastes,4,12,"And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him--a threefold cord is not quickly broken."
Ecclesiastes,4,13,Better was a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knew how to take advice.
Ecclesiastes,4,14,"For he went from prison to the throne, though in his own kingdom he had been born poor."
Ecclesiastes,4,15,"I saw all the living who move about under the sun, along with that youth who was to stand in the king's place."
Ecclesiastes,4,16,"There was no end of all the people, all of whom he led. Yet those who come later will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind."
Ecclesiastes,5,1,"Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. To draw near to listen is better than to offer the sacrifice of fools, for they do not know that they are doing evil."
Ecclesiastes,5,2,"Be not rash with your mouth, nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God, for God is in heaven and you are on earth. Therefore let your words be few."
Ecclesiastes,5,3,"For a dream comes with much business, and a fool's voice with many words."
Ecclesiastes,5,4,"When you vow a vow to God, do not delay paying it, for he has no pleasure in fools. Pay what you vow."
Ecclesiastes,5,5,It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay.
Ecclesiastes,5,6,"Let not your mouth lead you into sin, and do not say before the messenger that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry at your voice and destroy the work of your hands?"
Ecclesiastes,5,7,"For when dreams increase and words grow many, there is vanity; but God is the one you must fear."
Ecclesiastes,5,8,"If you see in a province the oppression of the poor and the violation of justice and righteousness, do not be amazed at the matter, for the high official is watched by a higher, and there are yet higher ones over them."
Ecclesiastes,5,9,But this is gain for a land in every way: a king committed to cultivated fields.
Ecclesiastes,5,10,"He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves wealth with his income; this also is vanity."
Ecclesiastes,5,11,"When goods increase, they increase who eat them, and what advantage has their owner but to see them with his eyes?"
Ecclesiastes,5,12,"Sweet is the sleep of a laborer, whether he eats little or much, but the full stomach of the rich will not let him sleep."
Ecclesiastes,5,13,"There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owner to his hurt,"
Ecclesiastes,5,14,"and those riches were lost in a bad venture. And he is father of a son, but he has nothing in his hand."
Ecclesiastes,5,15,"As he came from his mother's womb he shall go again, naked as he came, and shall take nothing for his toil that he may carry away in his hand."
Ecclesiastes,5,16,"This also is a grievous evil: just as he came, so shall he go, and what gain is there to him who toils for the wind?"
Ecclesiastes,5,17,"Moreover, all his days he eats in darkness in much vexation and sickness and anger."
Ecclesiastes,5,18,"Behold, what I have seen to be good and fitting is to eat and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of his life that God has given him, for this is his lot."
Ecclesiastes,5,19,"Everyone also to whom God has given wealth and possessions and power to enjoy them, and to accept his lot and rejoice in his toil--this is the gift of God."
Ecclesiastes,5,20,For he will not much remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart.
Ecclesiastes,6,1,"There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it lies heavy on mankind:"
Ecclesiastes,6,2,"a man to whom God gives wealth, possessions, and honor, so that he lacks nothing of all that he desires, yet God does not give him power to enjoy them, but a stranger enjoys them. This is vanity; it is a grievous evil."
Ecclesiastes,6,3,"If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not satisfied with life's good things, and he also has no burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he."
Ecclesiastes,6,4,"For it comes in vanity and goes in darkness, and in darkness its name is covered."
Ecclesiastes,6,5,"Moreover, it has not seen the sun or known anything, yet it finds rest rather than he."
Ecclesiastes,6,6,"Even though he should live a thousand years twice over, yet enjoy no good--do not all go to the one place?"
Ecclesiastes,6,7,"All the toil of man is for his mouth, yet his appetite is not satisfied."
Ecclesiastes,6,8,For what advantage has the wise man over the fool? And what does the poor man have who knows how to conduct himself before the living?
Ecclesiastes,6,9,Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the appetite: this also is vanity and a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes,6,10,"Whatever has come to be has already been named, and it is known what man is, and that he is not able to dispute with one stronger than he."
Ecclesiastes,6,11,"The more words, the more vanity, and what is the advantage to man?"
Ecclesiastes,6,12,"For who knows what is good for man while he lives the few days of his vain life, which he passes like a shadow? For who can tell man what will be after him under the sun?"
Ecclesiastes,7,1,"A good name is better than precious ointment, and the day of death than the day of birth."
Ecclesiastes,7,2,"It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting, for this is the end of all mankind, and the living will lay it to heart."
Ecclesiastes,7,3,"Sorrow is better than laughter, for by sadness of face the heart is made glad."
Ecclesiastes,7,4,"The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth."
Ecclesiastes,7,5,It is better for a man to hear the rebuke of the wise than to hear the song of fools.
Ecclesiastes,7,6,"For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fools; this also is vanity."
Ecclesiastes,7,7,"Surely oppression drives the wise into madness, and a bribe corrupts the heart."
Ecclesiastes,7,8,"Better is the end of a thing than its beginning, and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit."
Ecclesiastes,7,9,"Be not quick in your spirit to become angry, for anger lodges in the bosom of fools."
Ecclesiastes,7,10,"Say not, ""Why were the former days better than these?"" For it is not from wisdom that you ask this."
Ecclesiastes,7,11,"Wisdom is good with an inheritance, an advantage to those who see the sun."
Ecclesiastes,7,12,"For the protection of wisdom is like the protection of money, and the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of him who has it."
Ecclesiastes,7,13,Consider the work of God: who can make straight what he has made crooked?
Ecclesiastes,7,14,"In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider: God has made the one as well as the other, so that man may not find out anything that will be after him."
Ecclesiastes,7,15,"In my vain life I have seen everything. There is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his evildoing."
Ecclesiastes,7,16,"Be not overly righteous, and do not make yourself too wise. Why should you destroy yourself?"
Ecclesiastes,7,17,"Be not overly wicked, neither be a fool. Why should you die before your time?"
Ecclesiastes,7,18,"It is good that you should take hold of this, and from that withhold not your hand, for the one who fears God shall come out from both of them."
Ecclesiastes,7,19,Wisdom gives strength to the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city.
Ecclesiastes,7,20,Surely there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and never sins.
Ecclesiastes,7,21,"Do not take to heart all the things that people say, lest you hear your servant cursing you."
Ecclesiastes,7,22,Your heart knows that many times you have yourself cursed others.
Ecclesiastes,7,23,"All this I have tested by wisdom. I said, ""I will be wise,"" but it was far from me."
Ecclesiastes,7,24,"That which has been is far off, and deep, very deep; who can find it out?"
Ecclesiastes,7,25,"I turned my heart to know and to search out and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things, and to know the wickedness of folly and the foolishness that is madness."
Ecclesiastes,7,26,"And I find something more bitter than death: the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and whose hands are fetters. He who pleases God escapes her, but the sinner is taken by her."
Ecclesiastes,7,27,"Behold, this is what I found, says the Preacher, while adding one thing to another to find the scheme of things--"
Ecclesiastes,7,28,"which my soul has sought repeatedly, but I have not found. One man among a thousand I found, but a woman among all these I have not found."
Ecclesiastes,7,29,"See, this alone I found, that God made man upright, but they have sought out many schemes."
Ecclesiastes,8,1,"Who is like the wise? And who knows the interpretation of a thing? A man's wisdom makes his face shine, and the hardness of his face is changed."
Ecclesiastes,8,2,"I say: Keep the king's command, because of God's oath to him."
Ecclesiastes,8,3,"Be not hasty to go from his presence. Do not take your stand in an evil cause, for he does whatever he pleases."
Ecclesiastes,8,4,"For the word of the king is supreme, and who may say to him, ""What are you doing?"""
Ecclesiastes,8,5,"Whoever keeps a command will know no evil thing, and the wise heart will know the proper time and the just way."
Ecclesiastes,8,6,"For there is a time and a way for everything, although man's trouble lies heavy on him."
Ecclesiastes,8,7,"For he does not know what is to be, for who can tell him how it will be?"
Ecclesiastes,8,8,"No man has power to retain the spirit, or power over the day of death. There is no discharge from war, nor will wickedness deliver those who are given to it."
Ecclesiastes,8,9,"All this I observed while applying my heart to all that is done under the sun, when man had power over man to his hurt."
Ecclesiastes,8,10,Then I saw the wicked buried. They used to go in and out of the holy place and were praised in the city where they had done such things. This also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes,8,11,"Because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed speedily, the heart of the children of man is fully set to do evil."
Ecclesiastes,8,12,"Though a sinner does evil a hundred times and prolongs his life, yet I know that it will be well with those who fear God, because they fear before him."
Ecclesiastes,8,13,"But it will not be well with the wicked, neither will he prolong his days like a shadow, because he does not fear before God."
Ecclesiastes,8,14,"There is a vanity that takes place on earth, that there are righteous people to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked, and there are wicked people to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity."
Ecclesiastes,8,15,"And I commend joy, for man has no good thing under the sun but to eat and drink and be joyful, for this will go with him in his toil through the days of his life that God has given him under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,8,16,"When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done on earth, how neither day nor night do one's eyes see sleep,"
Ecclesiastes,8,17,"then I saw all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun. However much man may toil in seeking, he will not find it out. Even though a wise man claims to know, he cannot find it out."
Ecclesiastes,9,1,"But all this I laid to heart, examining it all, how the righteous and the wise and their deeds are in the hand of God. Whether it is love or hate, man does not know; both are before him."
Ecclesiastes,9,2,"It is the same for all, since the same event happens to the righteous and the wicked, to the good and the evil, to the clean and the unclean, to him who sacrifices and him who does not sacrifice. As is the good, so is the sinner, and he who swears is as he who shuns an oath."
Ecclesiastes,9,3,"This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that the same event happens to all. Also, the hearts of the children of man are full of evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead."
Ecclesiastes,9,4,"But he who is joined with all the living has hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion."
Ecclesiastes,9,5,"For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing, and they have no more reward, for the memory of them is forgotten."
Ecclesiastes,9,6,"Their love and their hate and their envy have already perished, and forever they have no more share in all that is done under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,9,7,"Go, eat your bread in joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart, for God has already approved what you do."
Ecclesiastes,9,8,Let your garments be always white. Let not oil be lacking on your head.
Ecclesiastes,9,9,"Enjoy life with the wife whom you love, all the days of your vain life that he has given you under the sun, because that is your portion in life and in your toil at which you toil under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,9,10,"Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might, for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol, to which you are going."
Ecclesiastes,9,11,"Again I saw that under the sun the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the intelligent, nor favor to those with knowledge, but time and chance happen to them all."
Ecclesiastes,9,12,"For man does not know his time. Like fish that are taken in an evil net, and like birds that are caught in a snare, so the children of man are snared at an evil time, when it suddenly falls upon them."
Ecclesiastes,9,13,"I have also seen this example of wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me."
Ecclesiastes,9,14,"There was a little city with few men in it, and a great king came against it and besieged it, building great siegeworks against it."
Ecclesiastes,9,15,"But there was found in it a poor, wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city. Yet no one remembered that poor man."
Ecclesiastes,9,16,"But I say that wisdom is better than might, though the poor man's wisdom is despised and his words are not heard."
Ecclesiastes,9,17,The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools.
Ecclesiastes,9,18,"Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good."
Ecclesiastes,10,1,Dead flies make the perfumer's ointment give off a stench; so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.
Ecclesiastes,10,2,"A wise man's heart inclines him to the right, but a fool's heart to the left."
Ecclesiastes,10,3,"Even when the fool walks on the road, he lacks sense, and he says to everyone that he is a fool."
Ecclesiastes,10,4,"If the anger of the ruler rises against you, do not leave your place, for calmness will lay great offenses to rest."
Ecclesiastes,10,5,"There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, as it were an error proceeding from the ruler:"
Ecclesiastes,10,6,"folly is set in many high places, and the rich sit in a low place."
Ecclesiastes,10,7,"I have seen slaves on horses, and princes walking on the ground like slaves."
Ecclesiastes,10,8,"He who digs a pit will fall into it, and a serpent will bite him who breaks through a wall."
Ecclesiastes,10,9,"He who quarries stones is hurt by them, and he who splits logs is endangered by them."
Ecclesiastes,10,10,"If the iron is blunt, and one does not sharpen the edge, he must use more strength, but wisdom helps one to succeed."
Ecclesiastes,10,11,"If the serpent bites before it is charmed, there is no advantage to the charmer."
Ecclesiastes,10,12,"The words of a wise man's mouth win him favor, but the lips of a fool consume him."
Ecclesiastes,10,13,"The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness, and the end of his talk is evil madness."
Ecclesiastes,10,14,"A fool multiplies words, though no man knows what is to be, and who can tell him what will be after him?"
Ecclesiastes,10,15,"The toil of a fool wearies him, for he does not know the way to the city."
Ecclesiastes,10,16,"Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child, and your princes feast in the morning!"
Ecclesiastes,10,17,"Happy are you, O land, when your king is the son of the nobility, and your princes feast at the proper time, for strength, and not for drunkenness!"
Ecclesiastes,10,18,"Through sloth the roof sinks in, and through indolence the house leaks."
Ecclesiastes,10,19,"Bread is made for laughter, and wine gladdens life, and money answers everything."
Ecclesiastes,10,20,"Even in your thought, do not curse the king, nor in your bedroom curse the rich, for a bird of the air will carry your voice, or some winged creature tell the matter."
Ecclesiastes,11,1,"Cast your bread upon the waters, for you will find it after many days."
Ecclesiastes,11,2,"Give a portion to seven, or even to eight, for you know not what disaster may happen on earth."
Ecclesiastes,11,3,"If the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves on the earth, and if a tree falls to the south or to the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it will lie."
Ecclesiastes,11,4,"He who observes the wind will not sow, and he who regards the clouds will not reap."
Ecclesiastes,11,5,"As you do not know the way the spirit comes to the bones in the womb of a woman with child, so you do not know the work of God who makes everything."
Ecclesiastes,11,6,"In the morning sow your seed, and at evening withhold not your hand, for you do not know which will prosper, this or that, or whether both alike will be good."
Ecclesiastes,11,7,"Light is sweet, and it is pleasant for the eyes to see the sun."
Ecclesiastes,11,8,"So if a person lives many years, let him rejoice in them all; but let him remember that the days of darkness will be many. All that comes is vanity."
Ecclesiastes,11,9,"Rejoice, O young man, in your youth, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth. Walk in the ways of your heart and the sight of your eyes. But know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment."
Ecclesiastes,11,10,"Remove vexation from your heart, and put away pain from your body, for youth and the dawn of life are vanity."
Ecclesiastes,12,1,"Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth, before the evil days come and the years draw near of which you will say, ""I have no pleasure in them"";"
Ecclesiastes,12,2,"before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars are darkened and the clouds return after the rain,"
Ecclesiastes,12,3,"in the day when the keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men are bent, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those who look through the windows are dimmed,"
Ecclesiastes,12,4,"and the doors on the street are shut--when the sound of the grinding is low, and one rises up at the sound of a bird, and all the daughters of song are brought low--"
Ecclesiastes,12,5,"they are afraid also of what is high, and terrors are in the way; the almond tree blossoms, the grasshopper drags itself along, and desire fails, because man is going to his eternal home, and the mourners go about the streets--"
Ecclesiastes,12,6,"before the silver cord is snapped, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher is shattered at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern,"
Ecclesiastes,12,7,"and the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it."
Ecclesiastes,12,8,"Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher; all is vanity."
Ecclesiastes,12,9,"Besides being wise, the Preacher also taught the people knowledge, weighing and studying and arranging many proverbs with great care."
Ecclesiastes,12,10,"The Preacher sought to find words of delight, and uprightly he wrote words of truth."
Ecclesiastes,12,11,"The words of the wise are like goads, and like nails firmly fixed are the collected sayings; they are given by one Shepherd."

Ecclesiastes,12,14,"For God will bring every deed into judgment, with every secret thing, whether good or evil."
Song of Solomon,1,1,"The Song of Songs, which is Solomon's."
Song of Solomon,1,2,Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine;
Song of Solomon,1,3,your anointing oils are fragrant; your name is oil poured out; therefore virgins love you.
Song of Solomon,1,4,Draw me after you; let us run. The king has brought me into his chambers. We will exult and rejoice in you; we will extol your love more than wine; rightly do they love you.
Song of Solomon,1,5,"I am very dark, but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon."
Song of Solomon,1,6,"Do not gaze at me because I am dark, because the sun has looked upon me. My mother's sons were angry with me; they made me keeper of the vineyards, but my own vineyard I have not kept!"

Song of Solomon,2,2,"As a lily among brambles, so is my love among the young women."

Song of Solomon,2,15,"Catch the foxes for us, the little foxes that spoil the vineyards, for our vineyards are in blossom."""

Isaiah,39,3,"Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, ""What did these men say? And from where did they come to you?"" Hezekiah said, ""They have come to me from a far country, from Babylon."""

Jeremiah,6,30,"Rejected silver they are called, for the LORD has rejected them."""
Jeremiah,7,1,The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
Jeremiah,7,2,"""Stand in the gate of the LORD's house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the LORD, all you men of Judah who enter these gates to worship the LORD."
Jeremiah,7,3,"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Amend your ways and your deeds, and I will let you dwell in this place."
Jeremiah,7,4,"Do not trust in these deceptive words: 'This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD.'"
Jeremiah,7,5,"""For if you truly amend your ways and your deeds, if you truly execute justice one with another,"
Jeremiah,7,6,"if you do not oppress the sojourner, the fatherless, or the widow, or shed innocent blood in this place, and if you do not go after other gods to your own harm,"
Jeremiah,7,7,"then I will let you dwell in this place, in the land that I gave of old to your fathers forever."
Jeremiah,7,8,"""Behold, you trust in deceptive words to no avail."
Jeremiah,7,9,"Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, make offerings to Baal, and go after other gods that you have not known,"
Jeremiah,7,10,"and then come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, 'We are delivered!'--only to go on doing all these abominations?"
Jeremiah,7,11,"Has this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I myself have seen it, declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,7,12,"Go now to my place that was in Shiloh, where I made my name dwell at first, and see what I did to it because of the evil of my people Israel."
Jeremiah,7,13,"And now, because you have done all these things, declares the LORD, and when I spoke to you persistently you did not listen, and when I called you, you did not answer,"
Jeremiah,7,14,"therefore I will do to the house that is called by my name, and in which you trust, and to the place that I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh."
Jeremiah,7,15,"And I will cast you out of my sight, as I cast out all your kinsmen, all the offspring of Ephraim."
Jeremiah,7,16,"""As for you, do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer for them, and do not intercede with me, for I will not hear you."
Jeremiah,7,17,Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
Jeremiah,7,18,"The children gather wood, the fathers kindle fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes for the queen of heaven. And they pour out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger."
Jeremiah,7,19,"Is it I whom they provoke? declares the LORD. Is it not themselves, to their own shame?"
Jeremiah,7,20,"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: behold, my anger and my wrath will be poured out on this place, upon man and beast, upon the trees of the field and the fruit of the ground; it will burn and not be quenched."""
Jeremiah,7,21,"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: ""Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat the flesh."
Jeremiah,7,22,"For in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak to your fathers or command them concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices."
Jeremiah,7,23,"But this command I gave them: 'Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people. And walk in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.'"
Jeremiah,7,24,"But they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked in their own counsels and the stubbornness of their evil hearts, and went backward and not forward."
Jeremiah,7,25,"From the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt to this day, I have persistently sent all my servants the prophets to them, day after day."
Jeremiah,7,26,"Yet they did not listen to me or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck. They did worse than their fathers."
Jeremiah,7,27,"""So you shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you. You shall call to them, but they will not answer you."
Jeremiah,7,28,"And you shall say to them, 'This is the nation that did not obey the voice of the LORD their God, and did not accept discipline; truth has perished; it is cut off from their lips."
Jeremiah,7,29,"""'Cut off your hair and cast it away; raise a lamentation on the bare heights, for the LORD has rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.'"
Jeremiah,7,30,"""For the sons of Judah have done evil in my sight, declares the LORD. They have set their detestable things in the house that is called by my name, to defile it."
Jeremiah,7,31,"And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I did not command, nor did it come into my mind."
Jeremiah,7,32,"Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when it will no more be called Topheth, or the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter; for they will bury in Topheth, because there is no room elsewhere."
Jeremiah,7,33,"And the dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the air, and for the beasts of the earth, and none will frighten them away."
Jeremiah,7,34,"And I will silence in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, for the land shall become a waste."
Jeremiah,8,1,"""At that time, declares the LORD, the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of its officials, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be brought out of their tombs."
Jeremiah,8,2,"And they shall be spread before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven, which they have loved and served, which they have gone after, and which they have sought and worshiped. And they shall not be gathered or buried. They shall be as dung on the surface of the ground."
Jeremiah,8,3,"Death shall be preferred to life by all the remnant that remains of this evil family in all the places where I have driven them, declares the LORD of hosts."
Jeremiah,8,4,"""You shall say to them, Thus says the LORD: When men fall, do they not rise again? If one turns away, does he not return?"
Jeremiah,8,5,Why then has this people turned away in perpetual backsliding? They hold fast to deceit; they refuse to return.
Jeremiah,8,6,"I have paid attention and listened, but they have not spoken rightly; no man relents of his evil, saying, 'What have I done?' Everyone turns to his own course, like a horse plunging headlong into battle."
Jeremiah,8,7,"Even the stork in the heavens knows her times, and the turtledove, swallow, and crane keep the time of their coming, but my people know not the rules of the LORD."
Jeremiah,8,8,"""How can you say, 'We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us'? But behold, the lying pen of the scribes has made it into a lie."
Jeremiah,8,9,"The wise men shall be put to shame; they shall be dismayed and taken; behold, they have rejected the word of the LORD, so what wisdom is in them?"
Jeremiah,8,10,"Therefore I will give their wives to others and their fields to conquerors, because from the least to the greatest everyone is greedy for unjust gain; from prophet to priest, everyone deals falsely."
Jeremiah,8,11,"They have healed the wound of my people lightly, saying, 'Peace, peace,' when there is no peace."
Jeremiah,8,12,"Were they ashamed when they committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed; they did not know how to blush. Therefore they shall fall among the fallen; when I punish them, they shall be overthrown, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,8,13,"When I would gather them, declares the LORD, there are no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree; even the leaves are withered, and what I gave them has passed away from them."""
Jeremiah,8,14,"Why do we sit still? Gather together; let us go into the fortified cities and perish there, for the LORD our God has doomed us to perish and has given us poisoned water to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD."
Jeremiah,8,15,"We looked for peace, but no good came; for a time of healing, but behold, terror."
Jeremiah,8,16,"""The snorting of their horses is heard from Dan; at the sound of the neighing of their stallions the whole land quakes. They come and devour the land and all that fills it, the city and those who dwell in it."
Jeremiah,8,17,"For behold, I am sending among you serpents, adders that cannot be charmed, and they shall bite you,"" declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,8,18,My joy is gone; grief is upon me; my heart is sick within me.
Jeremiah,8,19,"Behold, the cry of the daughter of my people from the length and breadth of the land: ""Is the LORD not in Zion? Is her King not in her?Why have they provoked me to anger with their carved images and with their foreign idols?"""
Jeremiah,8,20,"""The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved."""
Jeremiah,8,21,"For the wound of the daughter of my people is my heart wounded; I mourn, and dismay has taken hold on me."
Jeremiah,8,22,Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then has the health of the daughter of my people not been restored?
Jeremiah,9,1,"Oh that my head were waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!"
Jeremiah,9,2,"Oh that I had in the desert a travelers' lodging place, that I might leave my people and go away from them! For they are all adulterers, a company of treacherous men."
Jeremiah,9,3,"They bend their tongue like a bow; falsehood and not truth has grown strong in the land; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they do not know me, declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,9,4,"Let everyone beware of his neighbor, and put no trust in any brother, for every brother is a deceiver, and every neighbor goes about as a slanderer."
Jeremiah,9,5,"Everyone deceives his neighbor, and no one speaks the truth; they have taught their tongue to speak lies; they weary themselves committing iniquity."
Jeremiah,9,6,"Heaping oppression upon oppression, and deceit upon deceit, they refuse to know me, declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,9,7,"Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: ""Behold, I will refine them and test them, for what else can I do, because of my people?"
Jeremiah,9,8,"Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaks deceitfully; with his mouth each speaks peace to his neighbor, but in his heart he plans an ambush for him."
Jeremiah,9,9,"Shall I not punish them for these things? declares the LORD, and shall I not avenge myself on a nation such as this?"
Jeremiah,9,10,"""I will take up weeping and wailing for the mountains, and a lamentation for the pastures of the wilderness, because they are laid waste so that no one passes through, and the lowing of cattle is not heard; both the birds of the air and the beasts have fled and are gone."
Jeremiah,9,11,"I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, a lair of jackals, and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant."""
Jeremiah,9,12,"Who is the man so wise that he can understand this? To whom has the mouth of the LORD spoken, that he may declare it? Why is the land ruined and laid waste like a wilderness, so that no one passes through?"
Jeremiah,9,13,"And the LORD says: ""Because they have forsaken my law that I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice or walked in accord with it,"
Jeremiah,9,14,"but have stubbornly followed their own hearts and have gone after the Baals, as their fathers taught them."
Jeremiah,9,15,"Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will feed this people with bitter food, and give them poisonous water to drink."
Jeremiah,9,16,"I will scatter them among the nations whom neither they nor their fathers have known, and I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them."""
Jeremiah,9,17,"Thus says the LORD of hosts: ""Consider, and call for the mourning women to come; send for the skillful women to come;"
Jeremiah,9,18,"let them make haste and raise a wailing over us, that our eyes may run down with tears and our eyelids flow with water."
Jeremiah,9,19,"For a sound of wailing is heard from Zion: 'How we are ruined! We are utterly shamed, because we have left the land, because they have cast down our dwellings.'"""
Jeremiah,9,20,"Hear, O women, the word of the LORD, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth; teach to your daughters a lament, and each to her neighbor a dirge."
Jeremiah,9,21,"For death has come up into our windows; it has entered our palaces, cutting off the children from the streets and the young men from the squares."
Jeremiah,9,22,"Speak, ""Thus declares the LORD: 'The dead bodies of men shall fall like dung upon the open field, like sheaves after the reaper, and none shall gather them.'"""
Jeremiah,9,23,"Thus says the LORD: ""Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man boast in his riches,"
Jeremiah,9,24,"but let him who boasts boast in this, that he understands and knows me, that I am the LORD who practices steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the earth. For in these things I delight, declares the LORD."""
Jeremiah,9,25,"""Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will punish all those who are circumcised merely in the flesh--"
Jeremiah,9,26,"Egypt, Judah, Edom, the sons of Ammon, Moab, and all who dwell in the desert who cut the corners of their hair, for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart."""
Jeremiah,10,1,"Hear the word that the LORD speaks to you, O house of Israel."
Jeremiah,10,2,"Thus says the LORD: ""Learn not the way of the nations, nor be dismayed at the signs of the heavens because the nations are dismayed at them,"
Jeremiah,10,3,for the customs of the peoples are vanity. A tree from the forest is cut down and worked with an axe by the hands of a craftsman.
Jeremiah,10,4,They decorate it with silver and gold; they fasten it with hammer and nails so that it cannot move.
Jeremiah,10,5,"Their idols are like scarecrows in a cucumber field, and they cannot speak; they have to be carried, for they cannot walk. Do not be afraid of them, for they cannot do evil, neither is it in them to do good."""
Jeremiah,10,6,"There is none like you, O LORD; you are great, and your name is great in might."
Jeremiah,10,7,"Who would not fear you, O King of the nations? For this is your due; for among all the wise ones of the nations and in all their kingdoms there is none like you."
Jeremiah,10,8,They are both stupid and foolish; the instruction of idols is but wood!
Jeremiah,10,9,"Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz. They are the work of the craftsman and of the hands of the goldsmith; their clothing is violet and purple; they are all the work of skilled men."
Jeremiah,10,10,"But the LORD is the true God; he is the living God and the everlasting King. At his wrath the earth quakes, and the nations cannot endure his indignation."
Jeremiah,10,11,"Thus shall you say to them: ""The gods who did not make the heavens and the earth shall perish from the earth and from under the heavens."""
Jeremiah,10,12,"It is he who made the earth by his power, who established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding stretched out the heavens."
Jeremiah,10,13,"When he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he makes the mist rise from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain, and he brings forth the wind from his storehouses."
Jeremiah,10,14,"Every man is stupid and without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols, for his images are false, and there is no breath in them."
Jeremiah,10,15,"They are worthless, a work of delusion; at the time of their punishment they shall perish."
Jeremiah,10,16,"Not like these is he who is the portion of Jacob, for he is the one who formed all things, and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance; the LORD of hosts is his name."
Jeremiah,10,17,"Gather up your bundle from the ground, O you who dwell under siege!"
Jeremiah,10,18,"For thus says the LORD: ""Behold, I am slinging out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and I will bring distress on them, that they may feel it."""
Jeremiah,10,19,"Woe is me because of my hurt! My wound is grievous. But I said, ""Truly this is an affliction, and I must bear it."""
Jeremiah,10,20,"My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken; my children have gone from me, and they are not; there is no one to spread my tent again and to set up my curtains."
Jeremiah,10,21,"For the shepherds are stupid and do not inquire of the LORD; therefore they have not prospered, and all their flock is scattered."
Jeremiah,10,22,"A voice, a rumor! Behold, it comes!--a great commotion out of the north country to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a lair of jackals."
Jeremiah,10,23,"I know, O LORD, that the way of man is not in himself, that it is not in man who walks to direct his steps."
Jeremiah,10,24,"Correct me, O LORD, but in justice; not in your anger, lest you bring me to nothing."
Jeremiah,10,25,"Pour out your wrath on the nations that know you not, and on the peoples that call not on your name, for they have devoured Jacob; they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation."
Jeremiah,11,1,The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
Jeremiah,11,2,"""Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,11,3,"You shall say to them, Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Cursed be the man who does not hear the words of this covenant"
Jeremiah,11,4,"that I commanded your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Listen to my voice, and do all that I command you. So shall you be my people, and I will be your God,"
Jeremiah,11,5,"that I may confirm the oath that I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day."" Then I answered, ""So be it, LORD."""
Jeremiah,11,6,"And the LORD said to me, ""Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: Hear the words of this covenant and do them."
Jeremiah,11,7,"For I solemnly warned your fathers when I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, warning them persistently, even to this day, saying, Obey my voice."
Jeremiah,11,8,"Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but everyone walked in the stubbornness of his evil heart. Therefore I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did not."""
Jeremiah,11,9,"Again the LORD said to me, ""A conspiracy exists among the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,11,10,"They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words. They have gone after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant that I made with their fathers."
Jeremiah,11,11,"Therefore, thus says the LORD, behold, I am bringing disaster upon them that they cannot escape. Though they cry to me, I will not listen to them."
Jeremiah,11,12,"Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to whom they make offerings, but they cannot save them in the time of their trouble."
Jeremiah,11,13,"For your gods have become as many as your cities, O Judah, and as many as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to shame, altars to make offerings to Baal."
Jeremiah,11,14,"""Therefore do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer on their behalf, for I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their trouble."
Jeremiah,11,15,"What right has my beloved in my house, when she has done many vile deeds? Can even sacrificial flesh avert your doom? Can you then exult?"
Jeremiah,11,16,"The LORD once called you 'a green olive tree, beautiful with good fruit.' But with the roar of a great tempest he will set fire to it, and its branches will be consumed."
Jeremiah,11,17,"The LORD of hosts, who planted you, has decreed disaster against you, because of the evil that the house of Israel and the house of Judah have done, provoking me to anger by making offerings to Baal."""
Jeremiah,11,18,The LORD made it known to me and I knew; then you showed me their deeds.
Jeremiah,11,19,"But I was like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter. I did not know it was against me they devised schemes, saying, ""Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name be remembered no more."""
Jeremiah,11,20,"But, O LORD of hosts, who judges righteously, who tests the heart and the mind, let me see your vengeance upon them, for to you have I committed my cause."
Jeremiah,11,21,"Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek your life, and say, ""Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD, or you will die by our hand""--"
Jeremiah,11,22,"therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: ""Behold, I will punish them. The young men shall die by the sword, their sons and their daughters shall die by famine,"
Jeremiah,11,23,"and none of them shall be left. For I will bring disaster upon the men of Anathoth, the year of their punishment."""
Jeremiah,12,1,"Righteous are you, O LORD, when I complain to you; yet I would plead my case before you. Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why do all who are treacherous thrive?"
Jeremiah,12,2,"You plant them, and they take root; they grow and produce fruit; you are near in their mouth and far from their heart."
Jeremiah,12,3,"But you, O LORD, know me; you see me, and test my heart toward you. Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and set them apart for the day of slaughter."
Jeremiah,12,4,"How long will the land mourn and the grass of every field wither? For the evil of those who dwell in it the beasts and the birds are swept away, because they said, ""He will not see our latter end."""
Jeremiah,12,5,"""If you have raced with men on foot, and they have wearied you, how will you compete with horses? And if in a safe land you are so trusting, what will you do in the thicket of the Jordan?"
Jeremiah,12,6,"For even your brothers and the house of your father, even they have dealt treacherously with you; they are in full cry after you; do not believe them, though they speak friendly words to you."""
Jeremiah,12,7,"""I have forsaken my house; I have abandoned my heritage; I have given the beloved of my soul into the hands of her enemies."
Jeremiah,12,8,My heritage has become to me like a lion in the forest; she has lifted up her voice against me; therefore I hate her.
Jeremiah,12,9,"Is my heritage to me like a hyena's lair? Are the birds of prey against her all around? Go, assemble all the wild beasts; bring them to devour."
Jeremiah,12,10,Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard; they have trampled down my portion; they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
Jeremiah,12,11,"They have made it a desolation; desolate, it mourns to me. The whole land is made desolate, but no man lays it to heart."
Jeremiah,12,12,"Upon all the bare heights in the desert destroyers have come, for the sword of the LORD devours from one end of the land to the other; no flesh has peace."
Jeremiah,12,13,"They have sown wheat and have reaped thorns; they have tired themselves out but profit nothing. They shall be ashamed of their harvests because of the fierce anger of the LORD."""
Jeremiah,12,14,"Thus says the LORD concerning all my evil neighbors who touch the heritage that I have given my people Israel to inherit: ""Behold, I will pluck them up from their land, and I will pluck up the house of Judah from among them."
Jeremiah,12,15,"And after I have plucked them up, I will again have compassion on them, and I will bring them again each to his heritage and each to his land."
Jeremiah,12,16,"And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, 'As the LORD lives,' even as they taught my people to swear by Baal, then they shall be built up in the midst of my people."
Jeremiah,12,17,"But if any nation will not listen, then I will utterly pluck it up and destroy it, declares the LORD."""
Jeremiah,13,1,"Thus says the LORD to me, ""Go and buy a linen loincloth and put it around your waist, and do not dip it in water."""
Jeremiah,13,2,"So I bought a loincloth according to the word of the LORD, and put it around my waist."
Jeremiah,13,3,"And the word of the LORD came to me a second time,"
Jeremiah,13,4,"""Take the loincloth that you have bought, which is around your waist, and arise, go to the Euphrates and hide it there in a cleft of the rock."""
Jeremiah,13,5,"So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me."
Jeremiah,13,6,"And after many days the LORD said to me, ""Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take from there the loincloth that I commanded you to hide there."""
Jeremiah,13,7,"Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and I took the loincloth from the place where I had hidden it. And behold, the loincloth was spoiled; it was good for nothing."
Jeremiah,13,8,Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Jeremiah,13,9,"""Thus says the LORD: Even so will I spoil the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,13,10,"This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who stubbornly follow their own heart and have gone after other gods to serve them and worship them, shall be like this loincloth, which is good for nothing."
Jeremiah,13,11,"For as the loincloth clings to the waist of a man, so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me, declares the LORD, that they might be for me a people, a name, a praise, and a glory, but they would not listen."
Jeremiah,13,12,"""You shall speak to them this word: 'Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ""Every jar shall be filled with wine.""' And they will say to you, 'Do we not indeed know that every jar will be filled with wine?'"
Jeremiah,13,13,"Then you shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD: Behold, I will fill with drunkenness all the inhabitants of this land: the kings who sit on David's throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,13,14,"And I will dash them one against another, fathers and sons together, declares the LORD. I will not pity or spare or have compassion, that I should not destroy them.'"""
Jeremiah,13,15,"Hear and give ear; be not proud, for the LORD has spoken."
Jeremiah,13,16,"Give glory to the LORD your God before he brings darkness, before your feet stumble on the twilight mountains, and while you look for light he turns it into gloom and makes it deep darkness."
Jeremiah,13,17,"But if you will not listen, my soul will weep in secret for your pride; my eyes will weep bitterly and run down with tears, because the LORD's flock has been taken captive."
Jeremiah,13,18,"Say to the king and the queen mother: ""Take a lowly seat, for your beautiful crown has come down from your head."""
Jeremiah,13,19,"The cities of the Negeb are shut up, with none to open them; all Judah is taken into exile, wholly taken into exile."
Jeremiah,13,20,"""Lift up your eyes and see those who come from the north. Where is the flock that was given you, your beautiful flock?"
Jeremiah,13,21,What will you say when they set as head over you those whom you yourself have taught to be friends to you? Will not pangs take hold of you like those of a woman in labor?
Jeremiah,13,22,"And if you say in your heart, 'Why have these things come upon me?' it is for the greatness of your iniquity that your skirts are lifted up and you suffer violence."
Jeremiah,13,23,Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots? Then also you can do good who are accustomed to do evil.
Jeremiah,13,24,I will scatter you like chaff driven by the wind from the desert.
Jeremiah,13,25,"This is your lot, the portion I have measured out to you, declares the LORD, because you have forgotten me and trusted in lies."
Jeremiah,13,26,"I myself will lift up your skirts over your face, and your shame will be seen."
Jeremiah,13,27,"I have seen your abominations, your adulteries and neighings, your lewd whorings, on the hills in the field. Woe to you, O Jerusalem! How long will it be before you are made clean?"""
Jeremiah,14,1,The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought:
Jeremiah,14,2,"""Judah mourns and her gates languish; her people lament on the ground, and the cry of Jerusalem goes up."
Jeremiah,14,3,Her nobles send their servants for water; they come to the cisterns; they find no water; they return with their vessels empty; they are ashamed and confounded and cover their heads.
Jeremiah,14,4,"Because of the ground that is dismayed, since there is no rain on the land, the farmers are ashamed; they cover their heads."
Jeremiah,14,5,Even the doe in the field forsakes her newborn fawn because there is no grass.
Jeremiah,14,6,The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights; they pant for air like jackals; their eyes fail because there is no vegetation.
Jeremiah,14,7,"""Though our iniquities testify against us, act, O LORD, for your name's sake; for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against you."
Jeremiah,14,8,"O you hope of Israel, its savior in time of trouble, why should you be like a stranger in the land, like a traveler who turns aside to tarry for a night?"
Jeremiah,14,9,"Why should you be like a man confused, like a mighty warrior who cannot save? Yet you, O LORD, are in the midst of us, and we are called by your name; do not leave us."""
Jeremiah,14,10,"Thus says the LORD concerning this people: ""They have loved to wander thus; they have not restrained their feet; therefore the LORD does not accept them; now he will remember their iniquity and punish their sins."""
Jeremiah,14,11,"The LORD said to me: ""Do not pray for the welfare of this people."
Jeremiah,14,12,"Though they fast, I will not hear their cry, and though they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I will not accept them. But I will consume them by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence."""
Jeremiah,14,13,"Then I said: ""Ah, Lord GOD, behold, the prophets say to them, 'You shall not see the sword, nor shall you have famine, but I will give you assured peace in this place.'"""
Jeremiah,14,14,"And the LORD said to me: ""The prophets are prophesying lies in my name. I did not send them, nor did I command them or speak to them. They are prophesying to you a lying vision, worthless divination, and the deceit of their own minds."
Jeremiah,14,15,"Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name although I did not send them, and who say, 'Sword and famine shall not come upon this land': By sword and famine those prophets shall be consumed."
Jeremiah,14,16,"And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem, victims of famine and sword, with none to bury them--them, their wives, their sons, and their daughters. For I will pour out their evil upon them."

Jeremiah,18,1,The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:

Jeremiah,18,4,"And the vessel he was making of clay was spoiled in the potter's hand, and he reworked it into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to do."
Jeremiah,18,5,Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Jeremiah,18,6,"""O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter has done? declares the LORD. Behold, like the clay in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel."

Jeremiah,18,9,"And if at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will build and plant it,"
Jeremiah,18,10,"and if it does evil in my sight, not listening to my voice, then I will relent of the good that I had intended to do to it."
Jeremiah,18,11,"Now, therefore, say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: 'Thus says the LORD, behold, I am shaping disaster against you and devising a plan against you. Return, every one from his evil way, and amend your ways and your deeds.'"

Jeremiah,18,16,"making their land a horror, a thing to be hissed at forever. Everyone who passes by it is horrified and shakes his head."
Jeremiah,18,17,"Like the east wind I will scatter them before the enemy. I will show them my back, not my face, in the day of their calamity."""
Jeremiah,18,18,"Then they said, ""Come, let us make plots against Jeremiah, for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, let us strike him with the tongue, and let us not pay attention to any of his words."""

Jeremiah,19,3,"You shall say, 'Hear the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing such disaster upon this place that the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle."

Jeremiah,19,5,"and have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, which I did not command or decree, nor did it come into my mind--"
Jeremiah,19,6,"therefore, behold, days are coming, declares the LORD, when this place shall no more be called Topheth, or the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter."
Jeremiah,19,7,"And in this place I will make void the plans of Judah and Jerusalem, and will cause their people to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their life. I will give their dead bodies for food to the birds of the air and to the beasts of the earth."

Jeremiah,19,12,"Thus will I do to this place, declares the LORD, and to its inhabitants, making this city like Topheth."
Jeremiah,19,13,"The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah--all the houses on whose roofs offerings have been offered to all the host of heaven, and drink offerings have been poured out to other gods--shall be defiled like the place of Topheth.'"""

Jeremiah,20,1,"Now Pashhur the priest, the son of Immer, who was chief officer in the house of the LORD, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things."
Jeremiah,20,2,"Then Pashhur beat Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper Benjamin Gate of the house of the LORD."
Jeremiah,20,3,"The next day, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, ""The LORD does not call your name Pashhur, but Terror On Every Side."
Jeremiah,20,4,"For thus says the LORD: Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. They shall fall by the sword of their enemies while you look on.

Jeremiah,20,6,"And you, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house, shall go into captivity. To Babylon you shall go, and there you shall die, and there you shall be buried, you and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied falsely."""
Jeremiah,20,7,"O LORD, you have deceived me, and I was deceived; you are stronger than I, and you have prevailed. I have become a laughingstock all the day; everyone mocks me."
Jeremiah,20,8,"For whenever I speak, I cry out, I shout, ""Violence and destruction!"" For the word of the LORD has become for me a reproach and derision all day long."
Jeremiah,20,9,"If I say, ""I will not mention him, or speak any more in his name,"" there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with holding it in, and I cannot."
Jeremiah,20,10,"For I hear many whispering. Terror is on every side! ""Denounce him! Let us denounce him!"" say all my close friends, watching for my fall. ""Perhaps he will be deceived; then we can overcome him and take our revenge on him."""
Jeremiah,20,11,"But the LORD is with me as a dread warrior; therefore my persecutors will stumble; they will not overcome me. They will be greatly shamed, for they will not succeed. Their eternal dishonor will never be forgotten."

Jeremiah,20,15,"Cursed be the man who brought the news to my father, ""A son is born to you,"" making him very glad."
Jeremiah,20,16,"Let that man be like the cities that the LORD overthrew without pity; let him hear a cry in the morning and an alarm at noon,"
Jeremiah,20,17,"because he did not kill me in the womb; so my mother would have been my grave, and her womb forever great."
Jeremiah,20,18,"Why did I come out from the womb to see toil and sorrow, and spend my days in shame?"
Jeremiah,21,1,"This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur the son of Malchiah and Zephaniah the priest, the son of Maaseiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,21,2,"""Inquire of the LORD for us, for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is making war against us. Perhaps the LORD will deal with us according to all his wonderful deeds and will make him withdraw from us."""

Jeremiah,22,15,Do you think you are a king because you compete in cedar? Did not your father eat and drink and do justice and righteousness? Then it was well with him.
Jeremiah,22,16,He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well. Is not this to know me? declares the LORD.

Jeremiah,29,26,"'The LORD has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, to have charge in the house of the LORD over every madman who prophesies, to put him in the stocks and neck irons."
Jeremiah,29,27,Now why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who is prophesying to you?
Jeremiah,29,28,"For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, ""Your exile will be long; build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their produce.""'"""
Jeremiah,29,29,Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah,29,30,Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah,29,31,"""Send to all the exiles, saying, 'Thus says the LORD concerning Shemaiah of Nehelam: Because Shemaiah had prophesied to you when I did not send him, and has made you trust in a lie,"

Jeremiah,35,13,"""Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will you not receive instruction and listen to my words? declares the LORD."
Jeremiah,35,14,"The command that Jonadab the son of Rechab gave to his sons, to drink no wine, has been kept, and they drink none to this day, for they have obeyed their father's command. I have spoken to you persistently, but you have not listened to me."
Jeremiah,35,15,"I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, sending them persistently, saying, 'Turn now every one of you from his evil way, and amend your deeds, and do not go after other gods to serve them, and then you shall dwell in the land that I gave to you and your fathers.' But you did not incline your ear or listen to me."
Jeremiah,35,16,"The sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have kept the command that their father gave them, but this people has not obeyed me."
Jeremiah,35,17,"Therefore, thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing upon Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the disaster that I have pronounced against them, because I have spoken to them and they have not listened, I have called to them and they have not answered."""
Jeremiah,35,18,"But to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said, ""Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab your father and kept all his precepts and done all that he commanded you,"
Jeremiah,35,19,"therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab the son of Rechab shall never lack a man to stand before me."""
Jeremiah,36,1,"In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD:"
Jeremiah,36,2,"""Take a scroll and write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel and Judah and all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah until today."
Jeremiah,36,3,"It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the disaster that I intend to do to them, so that every one may turn from his evil way, and that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin."""
Jeremiah,36,4,"Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote on a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD that he had spoken to him."
Jeremiah,36,5,"And Jeremiah ordered Baruch, saying, ""I am banned from going to the house of the LORD,"
Jeremiah,36,6,"so you are to go, and on a day of fasting in the hearing of all the people in the LORD's house you shall read the words of the LORD from the scroll that you have written at my dictation. You shall read them also in the hearing of all the men of Judah who come out of their cities."
Jeremiah,36,7,"It may be that their plea for mercy will come before the LORD, and that every one will turn from his evil way, for great is the anger and wrath that the LORD has pronounced against this people."""
Jeremiah,36,8,And Baruch the son of Neriah did all that Jeremiah the prophet ordered him about reading from the scroll the words of the LORD in the LORD's house.
Jeremiah,36,9,"In the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the LORD."
Jeremiah,36,10,"Then, in the hearing of all the people, Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the scroll, in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper court, at the entry of the New Gate of the LORD's house."
Jeremiah,36,11,"When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the scroll,"
Jeremiah,36,12,"he went down to the king's house, into the secretary's chamber, and all the officials were sitting there: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the officials."
Jeremiah,36,13,"And Micaiah told them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the scroll in the hearing of the people."
Jeremiah,36,14,"Then all the officials sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, son of Shelemiah, son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, ""Take in your hand the scroll that you read in the hearing of the people, and come."" So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them."
Jeremiah,36,15,"And they said to him, ""Sit down and read it."" So Baruch read it to them."
Jeremiah,36,16,"When they heard all the words, they turned one to another in fear. And they said to Baruch, ""We must report all these words to the king."""
Jeremiah,36,17,"Then they asked Baruch, ""Tell us, please, how did you write all these words? Was it at his dictation?"""
Jeremiah,36,18,"Baruch answered them, ""He dictated all these words to me, while I wrote them with ink on the scroll."""
Jeremiah,36,19,"Then the officials said to Baruch, ""Go and hide, you and Jeremiah, and let no one know where you are."""
Jeremiah,36,20,"So they went into the court to the king, having put the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the secretary, and they reported all the words to the king."
Jeremiah,36,21,"Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the secretary. And Jehudi read it to the king and all the officials who stood beside the king."
Jeremiah,36,22,"It was the ninth month, and the king was sitting in the winter house, and there was a fire burning in the fire pot before him."
Jeremiah,36,23,"As Jehudi read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a knife and throw them into the fire in the fire pot, until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the fire pot."
Jeremiah,36,24,"Yet neither the king nor any of his servants who heard all these words was afraid, nor did they tear their garments."
Jeremiah,36,25,"Even when Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them."
Jeremiah,36,26,"And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son and Seraiah the son of Azriel and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet, but the LORD hid them."
Jeremiah,36,27,"Now after the king had burned the scroll with the words that Baruch wrote at Jeremiah's dictation, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:"
Jeremiah,36,28,"""Take another scroll and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned."
Jeremiah,36,29,"And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, 'Thus says the LORD, You have burned this scroll, saying, ""Why have you written in it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cut off from it man and beast?"""
Jeremiah,36,30,"Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit on the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day and the frost by night."
Jeremiah,36,31,"And I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity. I will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem and upon the people of Judah all the disaster that I have pronounced against them, but they would not hear.'"""
Jeremiah,36,32,"Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them."
Jeremiah,37,1,"Zedekiah the son of Josiah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah, reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim."
Jeremiah,37,2,But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to the words of the LORD that he spoke through Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah,37,3,"King Zedekiah sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the priest, the son of Maaseiah, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, ""Please pray for us to the LORD our God."""
Jeremiah,37,4,"Now Jeremiah was still going in and out among the people, for he had not yet been put in prison."
Jeremiah,37,5,"The army of Pharaoh had come out of Egypt. And when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news about them, they withdrew from Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,37,6,Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet:
Jeremiah,37,7,"""Thus says the LORD, God of Israel: Thus shall you say to the king of Judah who sent you to me to inquire of me, 'Behold, Pharaoh's army that came to help you is about to return to Egypt, to its own land."
Jeremiah,37,8,And the Chaldeans shall come back and fight against this city. They shall capture it and burn it with fire.
Jeremiah,37,9,"Thus says the LORD, Do not deceive yourselves, saying, ""The Chaldeans will surely go away from us,"" for they will not go away."
Jeremiah,37,10,"For even if you should defeat the whole army of Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and there remained of them only wounded men, every man in his tent, they would rise up and burn this city with fire.'"""
Jeremiah,37,11,"Now when the Chaldean army had withdrawn from Jerusalem at the approach of Pharaoh's army,"
Jeremiah,37,12,Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to receive his portion there among the people.
Jeremiah,37,13,"When he was at the Benjamin Gate, a sentry there named Irijah the son of Shelemiah, son of Hananiah, seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, ""You are deserting to the Chaldeans."""
Jeremiah,37,14,"And Jeremiah said, ""It is a lie; I am not deserting to the Chaldeans."" But Irijah would not listen to him, and seized Jeremiah and brought him to the officials."
Jeremiah,37,15,"And the officials were enraged at Jeremiah, and they beat him and imprisoned him in the house of Jonathan the secretary, for it had been made a prison."
Jeremiah,37,16,"When Jeremiah had come to the dungeon cells and remained there many days,"
Jeremiah,37,17,"King Zedekiah sent for him and received him. The king questioned him secretly in his house and said, ""Is there any word from the LORD?"" Jeremiah said, ""There is."" Then he said, ""You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon."""
Jeremiah,37,18,"Jeremiah also said to King Zedekiah, ""What wrong have I done to you or your servants or this people, that you have put me in prison?"
Jeremiah,37,19,"Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, 'The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land'?"
Jeremiah,37,20,"Now hear, please, O my lord the king: let my humble plea come before you and do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, lest I die there."""
Jeremiah,37,21,"So King Zedekiah gave orders, and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guard. And a loaf of bread was given him daily from the bakers' street, until all the bread of the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard."
Jeremiah,38,1,"Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah was saying to all the people,"
Jeremiah,38,2,"""Thus says the LORD: He who stays in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, but he who goes out to the Chaldeans shall live. He shall have his life as a prize of war, and live."
Jeremiah,38,3,"Thus says the LORD: This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon and be taken."""
Jeremiah,38,4,"Then the officials said to the king, ""Let this man be put to death, for he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man is not seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm."""
Jeremiah,38,5,"King Zedekiah said, ""Behold, he is in your hands, for the king can do nothing against you."""
Jeremiah,38,6,"So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king's son, which was in the court of the guard, letting Jeremiah down by ropes. And there was no water in the cistern, but only mud, and Jeremiah sank in the mud."
Jeremiah,38,7,"When Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch who was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern--the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate--"
Jeremiah,38,8,"Ebed-melech went from the king's house and said to the king,"
Jeremiah,38,9,"""My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they did to Jeremiah the prophet by casting him into the cistern, and he will die there of hunger, for there is no bread left in the city."""
Jeremiah,38,10,"Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, ""Take three men with you from here, and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies."""
Jeremiah,38,11,"So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to the house of the king, to a wardrobe in the storehouse, and took from there old rags and worn-out clothes, which he let down to Jeremiah in the cistern by ropes."
Jeremiah,38,12,"Then Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, ""Put the rags and clothes between your armpits and the ropes."" Jeremiah did so."
Jeremiah,38,13,Then they drew Jeremiah up with ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
Jeremiah,38,14,"King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and received him at the third entrance of the temple of the LORD. The king said to Jeremiah, ""I will ask you a question; hide nothing from me."""
Jeremiah,38,15,"Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, ""If I tell you, will you not surely put me to death? And if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me."""
Jeremiah,38,16,"Then King Zedekiah swore secretly to Jeremiah, ""As the LORD lives, who made our souls, I will not put you to death or deliver you into the hand of these men who seek your life."""
Jeremiah,38,17,"Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, ""Thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If you will surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then your life shall be spared, and this city shall not be burned with fire, and you and your house shall live."
Jeremiah,38,18,"But if you do not surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape from their hand."""
Jeremiah,38,19,"King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, ""I am afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest I be handed over to them and they deal cruelly with me."""
Jeremiah,38,20,"Jeremiah said, ""You shall not be given to them. Obey now the voice of the LORD in what I say to you, and it shall be well with you, and your life shall be spared."
Jeremiah,38,21,"But if you refuse to surrender, this is the vision which the LORD has shown to me:"
Jeremiah,38,22,"Behold, all the women left in the house of the king of Judah were being led out to the officials of the king of Babylon and were saying, ""'Your trusted friends have deceived you and prevailed against you; now that your feet are sunk in the mud, they turn away from you.'"
Jeremiah,38,23,"All your wives and your sons shall be led out to the Chaldeans, and you yourself shall not escape from their hand, but shall be seized by the king of Babylon, and this city shall be burned with fire."""
Jeremiah,38,24,"Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, ""Let no one know of these words, and you shall not die."
Jeremiah,38,25,"If the officials hear that I have spoken with you and come to you and say to you, 'Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; hide nothing from us and we will not put you to death,'"
Jeremiah,38,26,"then you shall say to them, 'I made a humble plea to the king that he would not send me back to the house of Jonathan to die there.'"""
Jeremiah,38,27,"Then all the officials came to Jeremiah and asked him, and he answered them as the king had instructed him. So they stopped speaking with him, for the conversation had not been overheard."
Jeremiah,38,28,And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.
Jeremiah,39,1,"In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and besieged it."
Jeremiah,39,2,"In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city."
Jeremiah,39,3,"Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came and sat in the middle gate: Nergal-sar-ezer, Samgar-nebu, Sar-sekim the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, with all the rest of the officers of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,39,4,"When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled, going out of the city at night by way of the king's garden through the gate between the two walls; and they went toward the Arabah."
Jeremiah,39,5,"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, at Riblah, in the land of Hamath; and he passed sentence on him."
Jeremiah,39,6,"The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah at Riblah before his eyes, and the king of Babylon slaughtered all the nobles of Judah."
Jeremiah,39,7,He put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him in chains to take him to Babylon.
Jeremiah,39,8,"The Chaldeans burned the king's house and the house of the people, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,39,9,"Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carried into exile to Babylon the rest of the people who were left in the city, those who had deserted to him, and the people who remained."
Jeremiah,39,10,"Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, left in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time."
Jeremiah,39,11,"Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave command concerning Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, saying,"
Jeremiah,39,12,"""Take him, look after him well, and do him no harm, but deal with him as he tells you."""
Jeremiah,39,13,"So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, Nebushazban the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon"
Jeremiah,39,14,"sent and took Jeremiah from the court of the guard. They entrusted him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, that he should take him home. So he lived among the people."
Jeremiah,39,15,The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the guard:
Jeremiah,39,16,"""Go, and say to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will fulfill my words against this city for harm and not for good, and they shall be accomplished before you on that day."
Jeremiah,39,17,"But I will deliver you on that day, declares the LORD, and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid."
Jeremiah,39,18,"For I will surely save you, and you shall not fall by the sword, but you shall have your life as a prize of war, because you have put your trust in me, declares the LORD.'"""
Jeremiah,40,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he took him bound in chains along with all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon."
Jeremiah,40,2,"The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, ""The LORD your God pronounced this disaster against this place."
Jeremiah,40,3,"The LORD has brought it about, and has done as he said. Because you sinned against the LORD and did not obey his voice, this thing has come upon you."
Jeremiah,40,4,"Now, behold, I release you today from the chains on your hands. If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will look after you well, but if it seems wrong to you to come with me to Babylon, do not come. See, the whole land is before you; go wherever you think it good and right to go."
Jeremiah,40,5,"If you remain, then return to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon appointed governor of the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people. Or go wherever you think it right to go."" So the captain of the guard gave him an allowance of food and a present, and let him go."
Jeremiah,40,6,"Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at Mizpah, and lived with him among the people who were left in the land."
Jeremiah,40,7,"When all the captains of the forces in the open country and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land and had committed to him men, women, and children, those of the poorest of the land who had not been taken into exile to Babylon,"
Jeremiah,40,8,"they went to Gedaliah at Mizpah--Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan the son of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men."
Jeremiah,40,9,"Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, swore to them and their men, saying, ""Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you."
Jeremiah,40,10,"As for me, I will dwell at Mizpah, to represent you before the Chaldeans who will come to us. But as for you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and store them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken."""
Jeremiah,40,11,"Likewise, when all the Judeans who were in Moab and among the Ammonites and in Edom and in other lands heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, as governor over them,"
Jeremiah,40,12,"then all the Judeans returned from all the places to which they had been driven and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah. And they gathered wine and summer fruits in great abundance."
Jeremiah,40,13,Now Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
Jeremiah,40,14,"and said to him, ""Do you know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?"" But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam would not believe them."
Jeremiah,40,15,"Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah at Mizpah, ""Please let me go and strike down Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he take your life, so that all the Judeans who are gathered about you would be scattered, and the remnant of Judah would perish?"""
Jeremiah,40,16,"But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, ""You shall not do this thing, for you are speaking falsely of Ishmael."""
Jeremiah,41,1,"In the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of the royal family, one of the chief officers of the king, came with ten men to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at Mizpah. As they ate bread together there at Mizpah,"
Jeremiah,41,2,"Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men with him rose up and struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, with the sword, and killed him, whom the king of Babylon had appointed governor in the land."
Jeremiah,41,3,"Ishmael also struck down all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldean soldiers who happened to be there."
Jeremiah,41,4,"On the day after the murder of Gedaliah, before anyone knew of it,"
Jeremiah,41,5,"eighty men arrived from Shechem and Shiloh and Samaria, with their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and their bodies gashed, bringing grain offerings and incense to present at the temple of the LORD."
Jeremiah,41,6,"And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah came out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he came. As he met them, he said to them, ""Come in to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam."""
Jeremiah,41,7,"When they came into the city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men with him slaughtered them and cast them into a cistern."
Jeremiah,41,8,"But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, ""Do not put us to death, for we have stores of wheat, barley, oil, and honey hidden in the fields."" So he refrained and did not put them to death with their companions."
Jeremiah,41,9,Now the cistern into which Ishmael had thrown all the bodies of the men whom he had struck down along with Gedaliah was the large cistern that King Asa had made for defense against Baasha king of Israel; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain.
Jeremiah,41,10,"Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah, the king's daughters and all the people who were left at Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites."
Jeremiah,41,11,"But when Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,"
Jeremiah,41,12,they took all their men and went to fight against Ishmael the son of Nethaniah. They came upon him at the great pool that is in Gibeon.
Jeremiah,41,13,"And when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him, they rejoiced."
Jeremiah,41,14,"So all the people whom Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah."
Jeremiah,41,15,"But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites."
Jeremiah,41,16,"Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him took from Mizpah all the rest of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, after he had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam--soldiers, women, children, and eunuchs, whom Johanan brought back from Gibeon."
Jeremiah,41,17,"And they went and stayed at Geruth Chimham near Bethlehem, intending to go to Egypt"
Jeremiah,41,18,"because of the Chaldeans. For they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land."
Jeremiah,42,1,"Then all the commanders of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest, came near"
Jeremiah,42,2,"and said to Jeremiah the prophet, ""Let our plea for mercy come before you, and pray to the LORD your God for us, for all this remnant--because we are left with but a few, as your eyes see us--"
Jeremiah,42,3,"that the LORD your God may show us the way we should go, and the thing that we should do."""
Jeremiah,42,4,"Jeremiah the prophet said to them, ""I have heard you. Behold, I will pray to the LORD your God according to your request, and whatever the LORD answers you I will tell you. I will keep nothing back from you."""
Jeremiah,42,5,"Then they said to Jeremiah, ""May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act according to all the word with which the LORD your God sends you to us."
Jeremiah,42,6,"Whether it is good or bad, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God to whom we are sending you, that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the LORD our God."""
Jeremiah,42,7,At the end of ten days the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah.
Jeremiah,42,8,"Then he summoned Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least to the greatest,"
Jeremiah,42,9,"and said to them, ""Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your plea for mercy before him:"
Jeremiah,42,10,"If you will remain in this land, then I will build you up and not pull you down; I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I relent of the disaster that I did to you."
Jeremiah,42,11,"Do not fear the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid. Do not fear him, declares the LORD, for I am with you, to save you and to deliver you from his hand."
Jeremiah,42,12,"I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy on you and let you remain in your own land."
Jeremiah,42,13,"But if you say, 'We will not remain in this land,' disobeying the voice of the LORD your God"
Jeremiah,42,14,"and saying, 'No, we will go to the land of Egypt, where we shall not see war or hear the sound of the trumpet or be hungry for bread, and we will dwell there,'"
Jeremiah,42,15,"then hear the word of the LORD, O remnant of Judah. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: If you set your faces to enter Egypt and go to live there,"
Jeremiah,42,16,"then the sword that you fear shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine of which you are afraid shall follow close after you to Egypt, and there you shall die."
Jeremiah,42,17,"All the men who set their faces to go to Egypt to live there shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. They shall have no remnant or survivor from the disaster that I will bring upon them."
Jeremiah,42,18,"""For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: As my anger and my wrath were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will be poured out on you when you go to Egypt. You shall become an execration, a horror, a curse, and a taunt. You shall see this place no more."
Jeremiah,42,19,"The LORD has said to you, O remnant of Judah, 'Do not go to Egypt.' Know for a certainty that I have warned you this day"
Jeremiah,42,20,"that you have gone astray at the cost of your lives. For you sent me to the LORD your God, saying, 'Pray for us to the LORD our God, and whatever the LORD our God says declare to us and we will do it.'"
Jeremiah,42,21,"And I have this day declared it to you, but you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God in anything that he sent me to tell you."

Jeremiah,52,19,"also the small bowls and the fire pans and the basins and the pots and the lampstands and the dishes for incense and the bowls for drink offerings. What was of gold the captain of the guard took away as gold, and what was of silver, as silver."
Jeremiah,52,20,"As for the two pillars, the one sea, the twelve bronze bulls that were under the sea, and the stands, which Solomon the king had made for the house of the LORD, the bronze of all these things was beyond weight."

Jeremiah,52,22,"On it was a capital of bronze. The height of the one capital was five cubits. A network and pomegranates, all of bronze, were around the capital. And the second pillar had the same, with pomegranates."
Jeremiah,52,23,There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were a hundred upon the network all around.

Jeremiah,52,32,"And he spoke kindly to him, and gave him a seat above the seats of the kings who were with him in Babylon."
Jeremiah,52,33,"So Jehoiachin put off his prison garments. And every day of his life he dined regularly at the king's table,"
Jeremiah,52,34,"and for his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king according to his daily need, until the day of his death as long as he lived."

Lamentations,2,20,"Look, O LORD, and see! With whom have you dealt thus? Should women eat the fruit of their womb, the children of their tender care? Should priest and prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?"
Lamentations,2,21,"In the dust of the streets lie the young and the old; my young women and my young men have fallen by the sword; you have killed them in the day of your anger, slaughtering without pity."
Lamentations,2,22,"You summoned as if to a festival day my terrors on every side, and on the day of the anger of the LORD no one escaped or survived; those whom I held and raised my enemy destroyed."
Lamentations,3,1,I am the man who has seen affliction under the rod of his wrath;
Lamentations,3,2,he has driven and brought me into darkness without any light;
Lamentations,3,3,surely against me he turns his hand again and again the whole day long.
Lamentations,3,4,He has made my flesh and my skin waste away; he has broken my bones;
Lamentations,3,5,he has besieged and enveloped me with bitterness and tribulation;
Lamentations,3,6,he has made me dwell in darkness like the dead of long ago.
Lamentations,3,7,He has walled me about so that I cannot escape; he has made my chains heavy;
Lamentations,3,8,"though I call and cry for help, he shuts out my prayer;"
Lamentations,3,9,he has blocked my ways with blocks of stones; he has made my paths crooked.
Lamentations,3,10,"He is a bear lying in wait for me, a lion in hiding;"
Lamentations,3,11,he turned aside my steps and tore me to pieces; he has made me desolate;
Lamentations,3,12,he bent his bow and set me as a target for his arrow.
Lamentations,3,13,He drove into my kidneys the arrows of his quiver;
Lamentations,3,14,"I have become the laughingstock of all peoples, the object of their taunts all day long."
Lamentations,3,15,He has filled me with bitterness; he has sated me with wormwood.
Lamentations,3,16,"He has made my teeth grind on gravel, and made me cower in ashes;"
Lamentations,3,17,my soul is bereft of peace; I have forgotten what happiness is;
Lamentations,3,18,"so I say, ""My endurance has perished; so has my hope from the LORD."""
Lamentations,3,19,"Remember my affliction and my wanderings, the wormwood and the gall!"
Lamentations,3,20,My soul continually remembers it and is bowed down within me.
Lamentations,3,21,"But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope:"
Lamentations,3,22,The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases; his mercies never come to an end;
Lamentations,3,23,they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.
Lamentations,3,24,"""The LORD is my portion,"" says my soul, ""therefore I will hope in him."""
Lamentations,3,25,"The LORD is good to those who wait for him, to the soul who seeks him."
Lamentations,3,26,It is good that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.
Lamentations,3,27,It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.
Lamentations,3,28,Let him sit alone in silence when it is laid on him;
Lamentations,3,29,let him put his mouth in the dust--there may yet be hope;
Lamentations,3,30,"let him give his cheek to the one who strikes, and let him be filled with insults."
Lamentations,3,31,"For the Lord will not cast off forever,"
Lamentations,3,32,"but, though he cause grief, he will have compassion according to the abundance of his steadfast love;"
Lamentations,3,33,for he does not willingly afflict or grieve the children of men.
Lamentations,3,34,"To crush underfoot all the prisoners of the earth,"
Lamentations,3,35,"to deny a man justice in the presence of the Most High,"
Lamentations,3,36,"to subvert a man in his lawsuit, the Lord does not approve."
Lamentations,3,37,"Who has spoken and it came to pass, unless the Lord has commanded it?"
Lamentations,3,38,Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that good and bad come?
Lamentations,3,39,"Why should a living man complain, a man, about the punishment of his sins?"
Lamentations,3,40,"Let us test and examine our ways, and return to the LORD!"
Lamentations,3,41,Let us lift up our hearts and hands to God in heaven:
Lamentations,3,42,"""We have transgressed and rebelled, and you have not forgiven."
Lamentations,3,43,"""You have wrapped yourself with anger and pursued us, killing without pity;"
Lamentations,3,44,you have wrapped yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can pass through.
Lamentations,3,45,You have made us scum and garbage among the peoples.
Lamentations,3,46,"""All our enemies open their mouths against us;"
Lamentations,3,47,"panic and pitfall have come upon us, devastation and destruction;"
Lamentations,3,48,my eyes flow with rivers of tears because of the destruction of the daughter of my people.
Lamentations,3,49,"""My eyes will flow without ceasing, without respite,"
Lamentations,3,50,until the LORD from heaven looks down and sees;
Lamentations,3,51,my eyes cause me grief at the fate of all the daughters of my city.
Lamentations,3,52,"""I have been hunted like a bird by those who were my enemies without cause;"
Lamentations,3,53,they flung me alive into the pit and cast stones on me;
Lamentations,3,54,"water closed over my head; I said, 'I am lost.'"
Lamentations,3,55,"""I called on your name, O LORD, from the depths of the pit;"
Lamentations,3,56,"you heard my plea, 'Do not close your ear to my cry for help!'"
Lamentations,3,57,"You came near when I called on you; you said, 'Do not fear!'"
Lamentations,3,58,"""You have taken up my cause, O Lord; you have redeemed my life."
Lamentations,3,59,"You have seen the wrong done to me, O LORD; judge my cause."
Lamentations,3,60,"You have seen all their vengeance, all their plots against me."
Lamentations,3,61,"""You have heard their taunts, O LORD, all their plots against me."
Lamentations,3,62,The lips and thoughts of my assailants are against me all the day long.
Lamentations,3,63,Behold their sitting and their rising; I am the object of their taunts.
Lamentations,3,64,"""You will repay them, O LORD, according to the work of their hands."
Lamentations,3,65,You will give them dullness of heart; your curse will be on them.
Lamentations,3,66,"You will pursue them in anger and destroy them from under your heavens, O LORD."""
Lamentations,4,1,"How the gold has grown dim, how the pure gold is changed! The holy stones lie scattered at the head of every street."
Lamentations,4,2,"The precious sons of Zion, worth their weight in fine gold, how they are regarded as earthen pots, the work of a potter's hands!"
Lamentations,4,3,"Even jackals offer the breast; they nurse their young, but the daughter of my people has become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness."
Lamentations,4,4,"The tongue of the nursing infant sticks to the roof of its mouth for thirst; the children beg for food, but no one gives to them."
Lamentations,4,5,Those who once feasted on delicacies perish in the streets; those who were brought up in purple embrace ash heaps.
Lamentations,4,6,"For the chastisement of the daughter of my people has been greater than the punishment of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment, and no hands were wrung for her."
Lamentations,4,7,"Her princes were purer than snow, whiter than milk; their bodies were more ruddy than coral, the beauty of their form was like sapphire."
Lamentations,4,8,Now their face is blacker than soot; they are not recognized in the streets; their skin has shriveled on their bones; it has become as dry as wood.
Lamentations,4,9,"Happier were the victims of the sword than the victims of hunger, who wasted away, pierced by lack of the fruits of the field."
Lamentations,4,10,The hands of compassionate women have boiled their own children; they became their food during the destruction of the daughter of my people.
Lamentations,4,11,"The LORD gave full vent to his wrath; he poured out his hot anger, and he kindled a fire in Zion that consumed its foundations."
Lamentations,4,12,"The kings of the earth did not believe, nor any of the inhabitants of the world, that foe or enemy could enter the gates of Jerusalem."
Lamentations,4,13,"This was for the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, who shed in the midst of her the blood of the righteous."
Lamentations,4,14,"They wandered, blind, through the streets; they were so defiled with blood that no one was able to touch their garments."
Lamentations,4,15,"""Away! Unclean!"" people cried at them. ""Away! Away! Do not touch!"" So they became fugitives and wanderers; people said among the nations, ""They shall stay with us no longer."""
Lamentations,4,16,"The LORD himself has scattered them; he will regard them no more; no honor was shown to the priests, no favor to the elders."
Lamentations,4,17,"Our eyes failed, ever watching vainly for help; in our watching we watched for a nation which could not save."
Lamentations,4,18,"They dogged our steps so that we could not walk in our streets; our end drew near; our days were numbered, for our end had come."
Lamentations,4,19,Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles in the heavens; they chased us on the mountains; they lay in wait for us in the wilderness.
Lamentations,4,20,"The breath of our nostrils, the LORD's anointed, was captured in their pits, of whom we said, ""Under his shadow we shall live among the nations."""
Lamentations,4,21,"Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, you who dwell in the land of Uz; but to you also the cup shall pass; you shall become drunk and strip yourself bare."
Lamentations,4,22,"The punishment of your iniquity, O daughter of Zion, is accomplished; he will keep you in exile no longer; but your iniquity, O daughter of Edom, he will punish; he will uncover your sins."
Lamentations,5,1,"Remember, O LORD, what has befallen us; look, and see our disgrace!"
Lamentations,5,2,"Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our homes to foreigners."
Lamentations,5,3,"We have become orphans, fatherless; our mothers are like widows."
Lamentations,5,4,We must pay for the water we drink; the wood we get must be bought.
Lamentations,5,5,Our pursuers are at our necks; we are weary; we are given no rest.
Lamentations,5,6,"We have given the hand to Egypt, and to Assyria, to get bread enough."
Lamentations,5,7,"Our fathers sinned, and are no more; and we bear their iniquities."
Lamentations,5,8,Slaves rule over us; there is none to deliver us from their hand.
Lamentations,5,9,"We get our bread at the peril of our lives, because of the sword in the wilderness."
Lamentations,5,10,Our skin is hot as an oven with the burning heat of famine.
Lamentations,5,11,"Women are raped in Zion, young women in the towns of Judah."
Lamentations,5,12,Princes are hung up by their hands; no respect is shown to the elders.
Lamentations,5,13,"Young men are compelled to grind at the mill, and boys stagger under loads of wood."
Lamentations,5,14,"The old men have left the city gate, the young men their music."
Lamentations,5,15,The joy of our hearts has ceased; our dancing has been turned to mourning.
Lamentations,5,16,"The crown has fallen from our head; woe to us, for we have sinned!"
Lamentations,5,17,"For this our heart has become sick, for these things our eyes have grown dim,"
Lamentations,5,18,for Mount Zion which lies desolate; jackals prowl over it.
Lamentations,5,19,"But you, O LORD, reign forever; your throne endures to all generations."
Lamentations,5,20,"Why do you forget us forever, why do you forsake us for so many days?"
Lamentations,5,21,"Restore us to yourself, O LORD, that we may be restored! Renew our days as of old--"
Lamentations,5,22,"unless you have utterly rejected us, and you remain exceedingly angry with us."
Ezekiel,1,1,"In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the exiles by the Chebar canal, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God."
Ezekiel,1,2,"On the fifth day of the month (it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin),"
Ezekiel,1,3,"the word of the LORD came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the Chebar canal, and the hand of the LORD was upon him there."
Ezekiel,1,4,"As I looked, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, and a great cloud, with brightness around it, and fire flashing forth continually, and in the midst of the fire, as it were gleaming metal."
Ezekiel,1,5,"And from the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had a human likeness,"
Ezekiel,1,6,"but each had four faces, and each of them had four wings."
Ezekiel,1,7,"Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calf's foot. And they sparkled like burnished bronze."
Ezekiel,1,8,Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. And the four had their faces and their wings thus:
Ezekiel,1,9,"their wings touched one another. Each one of them went straight forward, without turning as they went."
Ezekiel,1,10,"As for the likeness of their faces, each had a human face. The four had the face of a lion on the right side, the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and the four had the face of an eagle."
Ezekiel,1,11,"Such were their faces. And their wings were spread out above. Each creature had two wings, each of which touched the wing of another, while two covered their bodies."
Ezekiel,1,12,"And each went straight forward. Wherever the spirit would go, they went, without turning as they went."
Ezekiel,1,13,"As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches moving to and fro among the living creatures. And the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning."
Ezekiel,1,14,"And the living creatures darted to and fro, like the appearance of a flash of lightning."
Ezekiel,1,15,"Now as I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, one for each of the four of them."
Ezekiel,1,16,"As for the appearance of the wheels and their construction: their appearance was like the gleaming of beryl. And the four had the same likeness, their appearance and construction being as it were a wheel within a wheel."
Ezekiel,1,17,"When they went, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went."
Ezekiel,1,18,"And their rims were tall and awesome, and the rims of all four were full of eyes all around."
Ezekiel,1,19,"And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose."
Ezekiel,1,20,"Wherever the spirit wanted to go, they went, and the wheels rose along with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels."
Ezekiel,1,21,"When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those rose from the earth, the wheels rose along with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels."
Ezekiel,1,22,"Over the heads of the living creatures there was the likeness of an expanse, shining like awe-inspiring crystal, spread out above their heads."
Ezekiel,1,23,"And under the expanse their wings were stretched out straight, one toward another. And each creature had two wings covering its body."
Ezekiel,1,24,"And when they went, I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of many waters, like the sound of the Almighty, a sound of tumult like the sound of an army. When they stood still, they let down their wings."
Ezekiel,1,25,"And there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads. When they stood still, they let down their wings."
Ezekiel,1,26,"And above the expanse over their heads there was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like sapphire; and seated above the likeness of a throne was a likeness with a human appearance."
Ezekiel,1,27,"And upward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were gleaming metal, like the appearance of fire enclosed all around. And downward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness around him."
Ezekiel,1,28,"Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around.Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard the voice of one speaking."
Ezekiel,2,1,"And he said to me, ""Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you."""
Ezekiel,2,2,"And as he spoke to me, the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet, and I heard him speaking to me."
Ezekiel,2,3,"And he said to me, ""Son of man, I send you to the people of Israel, to nations of rebels, who have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me to this very day."
Ezekiel,2,4,"The descendants also are impudent and stubborn: I send you to them, and you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD.'"
Ezekiel,2,5,And whether they hear or refuse to hear (for they are a rebellious house) they will know that a prophet has been among them.
Ezekiel,2,6,"And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you and you sit on scorpions. Be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,2,7,"And you shall speak my words to them, whether they hear or refuse to hear, for they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,2,8,"""But you, son of man, hear what I say to you. Be not rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you."""
Ezekiel,2,9,"And when I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me, and behold, a scroll of a book was in it."
Ezekiel,2,10,"And he spread it before me. And it had writing on the front and on the back, and there were written on it words of lamentation and mourning and woe."
Ezekiel,3,1,"And he said to me, ""Son of man, eat whatever you find here. Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel."""
Ezekiel,3,2,"So I opened my mouth, and he gave me this scroll to eat."
Ezekiel,3,3,"And he said to me, ""Son of man, feed your belly with this scroll that I give you and fill your stomach with it."" Then I ate it, and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey."
Ezekiel,3,4,"And he said to me, ""Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak with my words to them."
Ezekiel,3,5,"For you are not sent to a people of foreign speech and a hard language, but to the house of Israel--"
Ezekiel,3,6,"not to many peoples of foreign speech and a hard language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, if I sent you to such, they would listen to you."
Ezekiel,3,7,"But the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to me. Because all the house of Israel have a hard forehead and a stubborn heart."
Ezekiel,3,8,"Behold, I have made your face as hard as their faces, and your forehead as hard as their foreheads."
Ezekiel,3,9,"Like emery harder than flint have I made your forehead. Fear them not, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house."""
Ezekiel,3,10,"Moreover, he said to me, ""Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears."
Ezekiel,3,11,"And go to the exiles, to your people, and speak to them and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD,' whether they hear or refuse to hear."""
Ezekiel,3,12,"Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great earthquake: ""Blessed be the glory of the LORD from its place!"""
Ezekiel,3,13,"It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them, and the sound of a great earthquake."
Ezekiel,3,14,"The Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit, the hand of the LORD being strong upon me."
Ezekiel,3,15,"And I came to the exiles at Tel-abib, who were dwelling by the Chebar canal, and I sat where they were dwelling. And I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days."
Ezekiel,3,16,"And at the end of seven days, the word of the LORD came to me:"
Ezekiel,3,17,"""Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel. Whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me."
Ezekiel,3,18,"If I say to the wicked, 'You shall surely die,' and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, in order to save his life, that wicked person shall die for his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand."
Ezekiel,3,19,"But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, or from his wicked way, he shall die for his iniquity, but you will have delivered your soul."
Ezekiel,3,20,"Again, if a righteous person turns from his righteousness and commits injustice, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die. Because you have not warned him, he shall die for his sin, and his righteous deeds that he has done shall not be remembered, but his blood I will require at your hand."
Ezekiel,3,21,"But if you warn the righteous person not to sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning, and you will have delivered your soul."""
Ezekiel,3,22,"And the hand of the LORD was upon me there. And he said to me, ""Arise, go out into the valley, and there I will speak with you."""
Ezekiel,3,23,"So I arose and went out into the valley, and behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, like the glory that I had seen by the Chebar canal, and I fell on my face."
Ezekiel,3,24,"But the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet, and he spoke with me and said to me, ""Go, shut yourself within your house."
Ezekiel,3,25,"And you, O son of man, behold, cords will be placed upon you, and you shall be bound with them, so that you cannot go out among the people."
Ezekiel,3,26,"And I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, so that you shall be mute and unable to reprove them, for they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,3,27,"But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD.' He who will hear, let him hear; and he who will refuse to hear, let him refuse, for they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,4,1,"""And you, son of man, take a brick and lay it before you, and engrave on it a city, even Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,4,2,"And put siegeworks against it, and build a siege wall against it, and cast up a mound against it. Set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it all around."
Ezekiel,4,3,"And you, take an iron griddle, and place it as an iron wall between you and the city; and set your face toward it, and let it be in a state of siege, and press the siege against it. This is a sign for the house of Israel."
Ezekiel,4,4,"""Then lie on your left side, and place the punishment of the house of Israel upon it. For the number of the days that you lie on it, you shall bear their punishment."
Ezekiel,4,5,"For I assign to you a number of days, 390 days, equal to the number of the years of their punishment. So long shall you bear the punishment of the house of Israel."
Ezekiel,4,6,"And when you have completed these, you shall lie down a second time, but on your right side, and bear the punishment of the house of Judah. Forty days I assign you, a day for each year."
Ezekiel,4,7,"And you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm bared, and you shall prophesy against the city."
Ezekiel,4,8,"And behold, I will place cords upon you, so that you cannot turn from one side to the other, till you have completed the days of your siege."
Ezekiel,4,9,"""And you, take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and emmer, and put them into a single vessel and make your bread from them. During the number of days that you lie on your side, 390 days, you shall eat it."
Ezekiel,4,10,"And your food that you eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day; from day to day you shall eat it."
Ezekiel,4,11,"And water you shall drink by measure, the sixth part of a hin; from day to day you shall drink."
Ezekiel,4,12,"And you shall eat it as a barley cake, baking it in their sight on human dung."""
Ezekiel,4,13,"And the LORD said, ""Thus shall the people of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations where I will drive them."""
Ezekiel,4,14,"Then I said, ""Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, I have never defiled myself. From my youth up till now I have never eaten what died of itself or was torn by beasts, nor has tainted meat come into my mouth."""
Ezekiel,4,15,"Then he said to me, ""See, I assign to you cow's dung instead of human dung, on which you may prepare your bread."""
Ezekiel,4,16,"Moreover, he said to me, ""Son of man, behold, I will break the supply of bread in Jerusalem. They shall eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and they shall drink water by measure and in dismay."
Ezekiel,4,17,"I will do this that they may lack bread and water, and look at one another in dismay, and rot away because of their punishment."
Ezekiel,5,1,"""And you, O son of man, take a sharp sword. Use it as a barber's razor and pass it over your head and your beard. Then take balances for weighing and divide the hair."
Ezekiel,5,2,"A third part you shall burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are completed. And a third part you shall take and strike with the sword all around the city. And a third part you shall scatter to the wind, and I will unsheathe the sword after them."
Ezekiel,5,3,And you shall take from these a small number and bind them in the skirts of your robe.
Ezekiel,5,4,And of these again you shall take some and cast them into the midst of the fire and burn them in the fire. From there a fire will come out into all the house of Israel.
Ezekiel,5,5,"""Thus says the Lord GOD: This is Jerusalem. I have set her in the center of the nations, with countries all around her."
Ezekiel,5,6,"And she has rebelled against my rules by doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries all around her; for they have rejected my rules and have not walked in my statutes."
Ezekiel,5,7,"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you are more turbulent than the nations that are all around you, and have not walked in my statutes or obeyed my rules, and have not even acted according to the rules of the nations that are all around you,"
Ezekiel,5,8,"therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I, even I, am against you. And I will execute judgments in your midst in the sight of the nations."
Ezekiel,5,9,"And because of all your abominations I will do with you what I have never yet done, and the like of which I will never do again."
Ezekiel,5,10,"Therefore fathers shall eat their sons in your midst, and sons shall eat their fathers. And I will execute judgments on you, and any of you who survive I will scatter to all the winds."
Ezekiel,5,11,"Therefore, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things and with all your abominations, therefore I will withdraw. My eye will not spare, and I will have no pity."
Ezekiel,5,12,A third part of you shall die of pestilence and be consumed with famine in your midst; a third part shall fall by the sword all around you; and a third part I will scatter to all the winds and will unsheathe the sword after them.
Ezekiel,5,13,"""Thus shall my anger spend itself, and I will vent my fury upon them and satisfy myself. And they shall know that I am the LORD--that I have spoken in my jealousy--when I spend my fury upon them."
Ezekiel,5,14,"Moreover, I will make you a desolation and an object of reproach among the nations all around you and in the sight of all who pass by."
Ezekiel,5,15,"You shall be a reproach and a taunt, a warning and a horror, to the nations all around you, when I execute judgments on you in anger and fury, and with furious rebukes--I am the LORD, I have spoken--"
Ezekiel,5,16,"when I send against you the deadly arrows of famine, arrows for destruction, which I will send to destroy you, and when I bring more and more famine upon you and break your supply of bread."
Ezekiel,5,17,"I will send famine and wild beasts against you, and they will rob you of your children. Pestilence and blood shall pass through you, and I will bring the sword upon you. I am the LORD; I have spoken."""
Ezekiel,6,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,6,2,"""Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,"
Ezekiel,6,3,"and say, You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD! Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains and the hills, to the ravines and the valleys: Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places."
Ezekiel,6,4,"Your altars shall become desolate, and your incense altars shall be broken, and I will cast down your slain before your idols."
Ezekiel,6,5,"And I will lay the dead bodies of the people of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones around your altars."
Ezekiel,6,6,"Wherever you dwell, the cities shall be waste and the high places ruined, so that your altars will be waste and ruined, your idols broken and destroyed, your incense altars cut down, and your works wiped out."
Ezekiel,6,7,"And the slain shall fall in your midst, and you shall know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,6,8,"""Yet I will leave some of you alive. When you have among the nations some who escape the sword, and when you are scattered through the countries,"
Ezekiel,6,9,"then those of you who escape will remember me among the nations where they are carried captive, how I have been broken over their whoring heart that has departed from me and over their eyes that go whoring after their idols. And they will be loathsome in their own sight for the evils that they have committed, for all their abominations."
Ezekiel,6,10,"And they shall know that I am the LORD. I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them."""
Ezekiel,6,11,"Thus says the Lord GOD: ""Clap your hands and stamp your foot and say, Alas, because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel, for they shall fall by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence."
Ezekiel,6,12,"He who is far off shall die of pestilence, and he who is near shall fall by the sword, and he who is left and is preserved shall die of famine. Thus I will spend my fury upon them."
Ezekiel,6,13,"And you shall know that I am the LORD, when their slain lie among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every green tree, and under every leafy oak, wherever they offered pleasing aroma to all their idols."
Ezekiel,6,14,"And I will stretch out my hand against them and make the land desolate and waste, in all their dwelling places, from the wilderness to Riblah. Then they will know that I am the LORD."""
Ezekiel,7,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,7,2,"""And you, O son of man, thus says the Lord GOD to the land of Israel: An end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land."
Ezekiel,7,3,"Now the end is upon you, and I will send my anger upon you; I will judge you according to your ways, and I will punish you for all your abominations."
Ezekiel,7,4,"And my eye will not spare you, nor will I have pity, but I will punish you for your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. Then you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,7,5,"""Thus says the Lord GOD: Disaster after disaster! Behold, it comes."
Ezekiel,7,6,"An end has come; the end has come; it has awakened against you. Behold, it comes."
Ezekiel,7,7,"Your doom has come to you, O inhabitant of the land. The time has come; the day is near, a day of tumult, and not of joyful shouting on the mountains."
Ezekiel,7,8,"Now I will soon pour out my wrath upon you, and spend my anger against you, and judge you according to your ways, and I will punish you for all your abominations."
Ezekiel,7,9,"And my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity. I will punish you according to your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. Then you will know that I am the LORD, who strikes."
Ezekiel,7,10,"""Behold, the day! Behold, it comes! Your doom has come; the rod has blossomed; pride has budded."
Ezekiel,7,11,"Violence has grown up into a rod of wickedness. None of them shall remain, nor their abundance, nor their wealth; neither shall there be preeminence among them."
Ezekiel,7,12,"The time has come; the day has arrived. Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn, for wrath is upon all their multitude."
Ezekiel,7,13,"For the seller shall not return to what he has sold, while they live. For the vision concerns all their multitude; it shall not turn back; and because of his iniquity, none can maintain his life."
Ezekiel,7,14,"""They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready, but none goes to battle, for my wrath is upon all their multitude."
Ezekiel,7,15,"The sword is without; pestilence and famine are within. He who is in the field dies by the sword, and him who is in the city famine and pestilence devour."
Ezekiel,7,16,"And if any survivors escape, they will be on the mountains, like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, each one over his iniquity."
Ezekiel,7,17,"All hands are feeble, and all knees turn to water."
Ezekiel,7,18,"They put on sackcloth, and horror covers them. Shame is on all faces, and baldness on all their heads."
Ezekiel,7,19,"They cast their silver into the streets, and their gold is like an unclean thing. Their silver and gold are not able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD. They cannot satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs with it. For it was the stumbling block of their iniquity."
Ezekiel,7,20,"His beautiful ornament they used for pride, and they made their abominable images and their detestable things of it. Therefore I make it an unclean thing to them."
Ezekiel,7,21,"And I will give it into the hands of foreigners for prey, and to the wicked of the earth for spoil, and they shall profane it."
Ezekiel,7,22,"I will turn my face from them, and they shall profane my treasured place. Robbers shall enter and profane it."
Ezekiel,7,23,"""Forge a chain! For the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence."
Ezekiel,7,24,"I will bring the worst of the nations to take possession of their houses. I will put an end to the pride of the strong, and their holy places shall be profaned."
Ezekiel,7,25,"When anguish comes, they will seek peace, but there shall be none."
Ezekiel,7,26,"Disaster comes upon disaster; rumor follows rumor. They seek a vision from the prophet, while the law perishes from the priest and counsel from the elders."
Ezekiel,7,27,"The king mourns, the prince is wrapped in despair, and the hands of the people of the land are paralyzed by terror. According to their way I will do to them, and according to their judgments I will judge them, and they shall know that I am the LORD."""
Ezekiel,8,1,"In the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, with the elders of Judah sitting before me, the hand of the Lord GOD fell upon me there."
Ezekiel,8,2,"Then I looked, and behold, a form that had the appearance of a man. Below what appeared to be his waist was fire, and above his waist was something like the appearance of brightness, like gleaming metal."
Ezekiel,8,3,"He put out the form of a hand and took me by a lock of my head, and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the gateway of the inner court that faces north, where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy."
Ezekiel,8,4,"And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw in the valley."
Ezekiel,8,5,"Then he said to me, ""Son of man, lift up your eyes now toward the north."" So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, north of the altar gate, in the entrance, was this image of jealousy."
Ezekiel,8,6,"And he said to me, ""Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel are committing here, to drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see still greater abominations."""
Ezekiel,8,7,"And he brought me to the entrance of the court, and when I looked, behold, there was a hole in the wall."
Ezekiel,8,8,"Then he said to me, ""Son of man, dig in the wall."" So I dug in the wall, and behold, there was an entrance."
Ezekiel,8,9,"And he said to me, ""Go in, and see the vile abominations that they are committing here."""
Ezekiel,8,10,"So I went in and saw. And there, engraved on the wall all around, was every form of creeping things and loathsome beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel."
Ezekiel,8,11,"And before them stood seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan standing among them. Each had his censer in his hand, and the smoke of the cloud of incense went up."
Ezekiel,8,12,"Then he said to me, ""Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark, each in his room of pictures? For they say, 'The LORD does not see us, the LORD has forsaken the land.'"""
Ezekiel,8,13,"He said also to me, ""You will see still greater abominations that they commit."""
Ezekiel,8,14,"Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the LORD, and behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz."
Ezekiel,8,15,"Then he said to me, ""Have you seen this, O son of man? You will see still greater abominations than these."""
Ezekiel,8,16,"And he brought me into the inner court of the house of the LORD. And behold, at the entrance of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men, with their backs to the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east, worshiping the sun toward the east."
Ezekiel,8,17,"Then he said to me, ""Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations that they commit here, that they should fill the land with violence and provoke me still further to anger? Behold, they put the branch to their nose."
Ezekiel,8,18,"Therefore I will act in wrath. My eye will not spare, nor will I have pity. And though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them."""
Ezekiel,9,1,"Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, ""Bring near the executioners of the city, each with his destroying weapon in his hand."""
Ezekiel,9,2,"And behold, six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with his weapon for slaughter in his hand, and with them was a man clothed in linen, with a writing case at his waist. And they went in and stood beside the bronze altar."
Ezekiel,9,3,"Now the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub on which it rested to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writing case at his waist."
Ezekiel,9,4,"And the LORD said to him, ""Pass through the city, through Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and groan over all the abominations that are committed in it."""
Ezekiel,9,5,"And to the others he said in my hearing, ""Pass through the city after him, and strike. Your eye shall not spare, and you shall show no pity."
Ezekiel,9,6,"Kill old men outright, young men and maidens, little children and women, but touch no one on whom is the mark. And begin at my sanctuary."" So they began with the elders who were before the house."
Ezekiel,9,7,"Then he said to them, ""Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out."" So they went out and struck in the city."
Ezekiel,9,8,"And while they were striking, and I was left alone, I fell upon my face, and cried, ""Ah, Lord GOD! Will you destroy all the remnant of Israel in the outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem?"""
Ezekiel,9,9,"Then he said to me, ""The guilt of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great. The land is full of blood, and the city full of injustice. For they say, 'The LORD has forsaken the land, and the LORD does not see.'"
Ezekiel,9,10,"As for me, my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity; I will bring their deeds upon their heads."""
Ezekiel,9,11,"And behold, the man clothed in linen, with the writing case at his waist, brought back word, saying, ""I have done as you commanded me."""
Ezekiel,10,1,"Then I looked, and behold, on the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubim there appeared above them something like a sapphire, in appearance like a throne."
Ezekiel,10,2,"And he said to the man clothed in linen, ""Go in among the whirling wheels underneath the cherubim. Fill your hands with burning coals from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.""And he went in before my eyes."
Ezekiel,10,3,"Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the house, when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court."
Ezekiel,10,4,"And the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub to the threshold of the house, and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the LORD."
Ezekiel,10,5,"And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks."
Ezekiel,10,6,"And when he commanded the man clothed in linen, ""Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim,"" he went in and stood beside a wheel."
Ezekiel,10,7,"And a cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took some of it and put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who took it and went out."
Ezekiel,10,8,The cherubim appeared to have the form of a human hand under their wings.
Ezekiel,10,9,"And I looked, and behold, there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one beside each cherub, and the appearance of the wheels was like sparkling beryl."
Ezekiel,10,10,"And as for their appearance, the four had the same likeness, as if a wheel were within a wheel."
Ezekiel,10,11,"When they went, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went, but in whatever direction the front wheel faced, the others followed without turning as they went."
Ezekiel,10,12,"And their whole body, their rims, and their spokes, their wings, and the wheels were full of eyes all around--the wheels that the four of them had."
Ezekiel,10,13,"As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing ""the whirling wheels."""
Ezekiel,10,14,"And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was a human face, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle."
Ezekiel,10,15,And the cherubim mounted up. These were the living creatures that I saw by the Chebar canal.
Ezekiel,10,16,"And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them. And when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels did not turn from beside them."
Ezekiel,10,17,"When they stood still, these stood still, and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in them."
Ezekiel,10,18,"Then the glory of the LORD went out from the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim."
Ezekiel,10,19,"And the cherubim lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth before my eyes as they went out, with the wheels beside them. And they stood at the entrance of the east gate of the house of the LORD, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them."
Ezekiel,10,20,These were the living creatures that I saw underneath the God of Israel by the Chebar canal; and I knew that they were cherubim.
Ezekiel,10,21,"Each had four faces, and each four wings, and underneath their wings the likeness of human hands."
Ezekiel,10,22,"And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the same faces whose appearance I had seen by the Chebar canal. Each one of them went straight forward."
Ezekiel,11,1,"The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the east gate of the house of the LORD, which faces east. And behold, at the entrance of the gateway there were twenty-five men. And I saw among them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people."
Ezekiel,11,2,"And he said to me, ""Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity and who give wicked counsel in this city;"
Ezekiel,11,3,"who say, 'The time is not near to build houses. This city is the cauldron, and we are the meat.'"
Ezekiel,11,4,"Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man."""
Ezekiel,11,5,"And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and he said to me, ""Say, Thus says the LORD: So you think, O house of Israel. For I know the things that come into your mind."
Ezekiel,11,6,You have multiplied your slain in this city and have filled its streets with the slain.
Ezekiel,11,7,"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Your slain whom you have laid in the midst of it, they are the meat, and this city is the cauldron, but you shall be brought out of the midst of it."
Ezekiel,11,8,"You have feared the sword, and I will bring the sword upon you, declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,11,9,"And I will bring you out of the midst of it, and give you into the hands of foreigners, and execute judgments upon you."
Ezekiel,11,10,"You shall fall by the sword. I will judge you at the border of Israel, and you shall know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,11,11,"This city shall not be your cauldron, nor shall you be the meat in the midst of it. I will judge you at the border of Israel,"
Ezekiel,11,12,"and you shall know that I am the LORD. For you have not walked in my statutes, nor obeyed my rules, but have acted according to the rules of the nations that are around you."""
Ezekiel,11,13,"And it came to pass, while I was prophesying, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down on my face and cried out with a loud voice and said, ""Ah, Lord GOD! Will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?"""
Ezekiel,11,14,And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,11,15,"""Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, your kinsmen, the whole house of Israel, all of them, are those of whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, 'Go far from the LORD; to us this land is given for a possession.'"

Ezekiel,11,17,"Therefore say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.'"
Ezekiel,11,18,"And when they come there, they will remove from it all its detestable things and all its abominations."
Ezekiel,11,19,"And I will give them one heart, and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh,"
Ezekiel,11,20,"that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God."
Ezekiel,11,21,"But as for those whose heart goes after their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their deeds upon their own heads, declares the Lord GOD."""
Ezekiel,11,22,"Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them."
Ezekiel,11,23,And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city and stood on the mountain that is on the east side of the city.
Ezekiel,11,24,"And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to the exiles. Then the vision that I had seen went up from me."
Ezekiel,11,25,And I told the exiles all the things that the LORD had shown me.
Ezekiel,12,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,12,2,"""Son of man, you dwell in the midst of a rebellious house, who have eyes to see, but see not, who have ears to hear, but hear not, for they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,12,3,"As for you, son of man, prepare for yourself an exile's baggage, and go into exile by day in their sight. You shall go like an exile from your place to another place in their sight. Perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,12,4,"You shall bring out your baggage by day in their sight, as baggage for exile, and you shall go out yourself at evening in their sight, as those do who must go into exile."
Ezekiel,12,5,"In their sight dig through the wall, and bring your baggage out through it."
Ezekiel,12,6,"In their sight you shall lift the baggage upon your shoulder and carry it out at dusk. You shall cover your face that you may not see the land, for I have made you a sign for the house of Israel."""
Ezekiel,12,7,"And I did as I was commanded. I brought out my baggage by day, as baggage for exile, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my own hands. I brought out my baggage at dusk, carrying it on my shoulder in their sight."
Ezekiel,12,8,In the morning the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,12,9,"""Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, 'What are you doing?'"
Ezekiel,12,10,"Say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: This oracle concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are in it.'"
Ezekiel,12,11,"Say, 'I am a sign for you: as I have done, so shall it be done to them. They shall go into exile, into captivity.'"
Ezekiel,12,12,"And the prince who is among them shall lift his baggage upon his shoulder at dusk, and shall go out. They shall dig through the wall to bring him out through it. He shall cover his face, that he may not see the land with his eyes."
Ezekiel,12,13,"And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare. And I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, yet he shall not see it, and he shall die there."
Ezekiel,12,14,"And I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him, his helpers and all his troops, and I will unsheathe the sword after them."
Ezekiel,12,15,"And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them among the countries."
Ezekiel,12,16,"But I will let a few of them escape from the sword, from famine and pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they go, and may know that I am the LORD."""
Ezekiel,12,17,And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,12,18,"""Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink water with trembling and with anxiety."
Ezekiel,12,19,"And say to the people of the land, Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with anxiety, and drink water in dismay. In this way her land will be stripped of all it contains, on account of the violence of all those who dwell in it."
Ezekiel,12,20,"And the inhabited cities shall be laid waste, and the land shall become a desolation; and you shall know that I am the LORD."""
Ezekiel,12,21,And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,12,22,"""Son of man, what is this proverb that you have about the land of Israel, saying, 'The days grow long, and every vision comes to nothing'?"
Ezekiel,12,23,"Tell them therefore, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: I will put an end to this proverb, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel.' But say to them, The days are near, and the fulfillment of every vision."
Ezekiel,12,24,For there shall be no more any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel.
Ezekiel,12,25,"For I am the LORD; I will speak the word that I will speak, and it will be performed. It will no longer be delayed, but in your days, O rebellious house, I will speak the word and perform it, declares the Lord GOD."""
Ezekiel,12,26,And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,12,27,"""Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, 'The vision that he sees is for many days from now, and he prophesies of times far off.'"
Ezekiel,12,28,"Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: None of my words will be delayed any longer, but the word that I speak will be performed, declares the Lord GOD."""
Ezekiel,13,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,13,2,"""Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel, who are prophesying, and say to those who prophesy from their own hearts: 'Hear the word of the LORD!'"
Ezekiel,13,3,"Thus says the Lord GOD, Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!"
Ezekiel,13,4,"Your prophets have been like jackals among ruins, O Israel."
Ezekiel,13,5,"You have not gone up into the breaches, or built up a wall for the house of Israel, that it might stand in battle in the day of the LORD."
Ezekiel,13,6,"They have seen false visions and lying divinations. They say, 'Declares the LORD,' when the LORD has not sent them, and yet they expect him to fulfill their word."
Ezekiel,13,7,"Have you not seen a false vision and uttered a lying divination, whenever you have said, 'Declares the LORD,' although I have not spoken?"""
Ezekiel,13,8,"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: ""Because you have uttered falsehood and seen lying visions, therefore behold, I am against you, declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,13,9,"My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and who give lying divinations. They shall not be in the council of my people, nor be enrolled in the register of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,13,10,"Precisely because they have misled my people, saying, 'Peace,' when there is no peace, and because, when the people build a wall, these prophets smear it with whitewash,"
Ezekiel,13,11,"say to those who smear it with whitewash that it shall fall! There will be a deluge of rain, and you, O great hailstones, will fall, and a stormy wind break out."
Ezekiel,13,12,"And when the wall falls, will it not be said to you, 'Where is the coating with which you smeared it?'"
Ezekiel,13,13,"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: I will make a stormy wind break out in my wrath, and there shall be a deluge of rain in my anger, and great hailstones in wrath to make a full end."
Ezekiel,13,14,"And I will break down the wall that you have smeared with whitewash, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be laid bare. When it falls, you shall perish in the midst of it, and you shall know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,13,15,"Thus will I spend my wrath upon the wall and upon those who have smeared it with whitewash, and I will say to you, The wall is no more, nor those who smeared it,"
Ezekiel,13,16,"the prophets of Israel who prophesied concerning Jerusalem and saw visions of peace for her, when there was no peace, declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,13,17,"""And you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own minds. Prophesy against them"
Ezekiel,13,18,"and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the women who sew magic bands upon all wrists, and make veils for the heads of persons of every stature, in the hunt for souls! Will you hunt down souls belonging to my people and keep your own souls alive?"
Ezekiel,13,19,"You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, putting to death souls who should not die and keeping alive souls who should not live, by your lying to my people, who listen to lies."
Ezekiel,13,20,"""Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against your magic bands with which you hunt the souls like birds, and I will tear them from your arms, and I will let the souls whom you hunt go free, the souls like birds."
Ezekiel,13,21,"Your veils also I will tear off and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand as prey, and you shall know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,13,22,"Because you have disheartened the righteous falsely, although I have not grieved him, and you have encouraged the wicked, that he should not turn from his evil way to save his life,"
Ezekiel,13,23,"therefore you shall no more see false visions nor practice divination. I will deliver my people out of your hand. And you shall know that I am the LORD."""
Ezekiel,14,1,Then certain of the elders of Israel came to me and sat before me.
Ezekiel,14,2,And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,14,3,"""Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their hearts, and set the stumbling block of their iniquity before their faces. Should I indeed let myself be consulted by them?"
Ezekiel,14,4,"Therefore speak to them and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Any one of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart and sets the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and yet comes to the prophet, I the LORD will answer him as he comes with the multitude of his idols,"
Ezekiel,14,5,"that I may lay hold of the hearts of the house of Israel, who are all estranged from me through their idols."
Ezekiel,14,6,"""Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: Repent and turn away from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations."
Ezekiel,14,7,"For any one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel, who separates himself from me, taking his idols into his heart and putting the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and yet comes to a prophet to consult me through him, I the LORD will answer him myself."
Ezekiel,14,8,"And I will set my face against that man; I will make him a sign and a byword and cut him off from the midst of my people, and you shall know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,14,9,"And if the prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I, the LORD, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel."
Ezekiel,14,10,And they shall bear their punishment--the punishment of the prophet and the punishment of the inquirer shall be alike--
Ezekiel,14,11,"that the house of Israel may no more go astray from me, nor defile themselves anymore with all their transgressions, but that they may be my people and I may be their God, declares the Lord GOD."""
Ezekiel,14,12,And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,14,13,"""Son of man, when a land sins against me by acting faithlessly, and I stretch out my hand against it and break its supply of bread and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast,"
Ezekiel,14,14,"even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver but their own lives by their righteousness, declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,14,15,"""If I cause wild beasts to pass through the land, and they ravage it, and it be made desolate, so that no one may pass through because of the beasts,"
Ezekiel,14,16,"even if these three men were in it, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters. They alone would be delivered, but the land would be desolate."
Ezekiel,14,17,"""Or if I bring a sword upon that land and say, Let a sword pass through the land, and I cut off from it man and beast,"
Ezekiel,14,18,"though these three men were in it, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they alone would be delivered."
Ezekiel,14,19,"""Or if I send a pestilence into that land and pour out my wrath upon it with blood, to cut off from it man and beast,"
Ezekiel,14,20,"even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither son nor daughter. They would deliver but their own lives by their righteousness."
Ezekiel,14,21,"""For thus says the Lord GOD: How much more when I send upon Jerusalem my four disastrous acts of judgment, sword, famine, wild beasts, and pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast!"
Ezekiel,14,22,"But behold, some survivors will be left in it, sons and daughters who will be brought out; behold, when they come out to you, and you see their ways and their deeds, you will be consoled for the disaster that I have brought upon Jerusalem, for all that I have brought upon it."
Ezekiel,14,23,"They will console you, when you see their ways and their deeds, and you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, declares the Lord GOD."""
Ezekiel,15,1,And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,15,2,"""Son of man, how does the wood of the vine surpass any wood, the vine branch that is among the trees of the forest?"
Ezekiel,15,3,Is wood taken from it to make anything? Do people take a peg from it to hang any vessel on it?
Ezekiel,15,4,"Behold, it is given to the fire for fuel. When the fire has consumed both ends of it, and the middle of it is charred, is it useful for anything?"
Ezekiel,15,5,"Behold, when it was whole, it was used for nothing. How much less, when the fire has consumed it and it is charred, can it ever be used for anything!"
Ezekiel,15,6,"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,15,7,"And I will set my face against them. Though they escape from the fire, the fire shall yet consume them, and you will know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them."
Ezekiel,15,8,"And I will make the land desolate, because they have acted faithlessly, declares the Lord GOD."""
Ezekiel,16,1,Again the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,16,2,"""Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her abominations,"
Ezekiel,16,3,"and say, Thus says the Lord GOD to Jerusalem: Your origin and your birth are of the land of the Canaanites; your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite."
Ezekiel,16,4,"And as for your birth, on the day you were born your cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water to cleanse you, nor rubbed with salt, nor wrapped in swaddling cloths."
Ezekiel,16,5,"No eye pitied you, to do any of these things to you out of compassion for you, but you were cast out on the open field, for you were abhorred, on the day that you were born."
Ezekiel,16,6,"""And when I passed by you and saw you wallowing in your blood, I said to you in your blood, 'Live!' I said to you in your blood, 'Live!'"
Ezekiel,16,7,"I made you flourish like a plant of the field. And you grew up and became tall and arrived at full adornment. Your breasts were formed, and your hair had grown; yet you were naked and bare."
Ezekiel,16,8,"""When I passed by you again and saw you, behold, you were at the age for love, and I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your nakedness; I made my vow to you and entered into a covenant with you, declares the Lord GOD, and you became mine."
Ezekiel,16,9,Then I bathed you with water and washed off your blood from you and anointed you with oil.
Ezekiel,16,10,I clothed you also with embroidered cloth and shod you with fine leather. I wrapped you in fine linen and covered you with silk.
Ezekiel,16,11,And I adorned you with ornaments and put bracelets on your wrists and a chain on your neck.
Ezekiel,16,12,And I put a ring on your nose and earrings in your ears and a beautiful crown on your head.
Ezekiel,16,13,"Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing was of fine linen and silk and embroidered cloth. You ate fine flour and honey and oil. You grew exceedingly beautiful and advanced to royalty."
Ezekiel,16,14,"And your renown went forth among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect through the splendor that I had bestowed on you, declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,16,15,"""But you trusted in your beauty and played the whore because of your renown and lavished your whorings on any passerby; your beauty became his."
Ezekiel,16,16,"You took some of your garments and made for yourself colorful shrines, and on them played the whore. The like has never been, nor ever shall be."
Ezekiel,16,17,"You also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself images of men, and with them played the whore."
Ezekiel,16,18,"And you took your embroidered garments to cover them, and set my oil and my incense before them."
Ezekiel,16,19,"Also my bread that I gave you--I fed you with fine flour and oil and honey--you set before them for a pleasing aroma; and so it was, declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,16,20,"And you took your sons and your daughters, whom you had borne to me, and these you sacrificed to them to be devoured. Were your whorings so small a matter"
Ezekiel,16,21,that you slaughtered my children and delivered them up as an offering by fire to them?
Ezekiel,16,22,"And in all your abominations and your whorings you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, wallowing in your blood."
Ezekiel,16,23,"""And after all your wickedness (woe, woe to you! declares the Lord GOD),"
Ezekiel,16,24,you built yourself a vaulted chamber and made yourself a lofty place in every square.
Ezekiel,16,25,"At the head of every street you built your lofty place and made your beauty an abomination, offering yourself to any passerby and multiplying your whoring."
Ezekiel,16,26,"You also played the whore with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, multiplying your whoring, to provoke me to anger."
Ezekiel,16,27,"Behold, therefore, I stretched out my hand against you and diminished your allotted portion and delivered you to the greed of your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your lewd behavior."
Ezekiel,16,28,"You played the whore also with the Assyrians, because you were not satisfied; yes, you played the whore with them, and still you were not satisfied."
Ezekiel,16,29,"You multiplied your whoring also with the trading land of Chaldea, and even with this you were not satisfied."
Ezekiel,16,30,"""How lovesick is your heart, declares the Lord GOD, because you did all these things, the deeds of a brazen prostitute,"
Ezekiel,16,31,"building your vaulted chamber at the head of every street, and making your lofty place in every square. Yet you were not like a prostitute, because you scorned payment."
Ezekiel,16,32,"Adulterous wife, who receives strangers instead of her husband!"
Ezekiel,16,33,"Men give gifts to all prostitutes, but you gave your gifts to all your lovers, bribing them to come to you from every side with your whorings."
Ezekiel,16,34,"So you were different from other women in your whorings. No one solicited you to play the whore, and you gave payment, while no payment was given to you; therefore you were different."
Ezekiel,16,35,"""Therefore, O prostitute, hear the word of the LORD:"
Ezekiel,16,36,"Thus says the Lord GOD, Because your lust was poured out and your nakedness uncovered in your whorings with your lovers, and with all your abominable idols, and because of the blood of your children that you gave to them,"
Ezekiel,16,37,"therefore, behold, I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved and all those you hated. I will gather them against you from every side and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness."
Ezekiel,16,38,"And I will judge you as women who commit adultery and shed blood are judged, and bring upon you the blood of wrath and jealousy."
Ezekiel,16,39,"And I will give you into their hands, and they shall throw down your vaulted chamber and break down your lofty places. They shall strip you of your clothes and take your beautiful jewels and leave you naked and bare."
Ezekiel,16,40,"They shall bring up a crowd against you, and they shall stone you and cut you to pieces with their swords."
Ezekiel,16,41,"And they shall burn your houses and execute judgments upon you in the sight of many women. I will make you stop playing the whore, and you shall also give payment no more."
Ezekiel,16,42,"So will I satisfy my wrath on you, and my jealousy shall depart from you. I will be calm and will no more be angry."
Ezekiel,16,43,"Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have enraged me with all these things, therefore, behold, I have returned your deeds upon your head, declares the Lord GOD. ""Have you not committed lewdness in addition to all your abominations?"
Ezekiel,16,44,"""Behold, everyone who uses proverbs will use this proverb about you: 'Like mother, like daughter.'"
Ezekiel,16,45,"You are the daughter of your mother, who loathed her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite."
Ezekiel,16,46,"And your elder sister is Samaria, who lived with her daughters to the north of you; and your younger sister, who lived to the south of you, is Sodom with her daughters."
Ezekiel,16,47,Not only did you walk in their ways and do according to their abominations; within a very little time you were more corrupt than they in all your ways.
Ezekiel,16,48,"As I live, declares the Lord GOD, your sister Sodom and her daughters have not done as you and your daughters have done."
Ezekiel,16,49,"Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, but did not aid the poor and needy."
Ezekiel,16,50,"They were haughty and did an abomination before me. So I removed them, when I saw it."
Ezekiel,16,51,"Samaria has not committed half your sins. You have committed more abominations than they, and have made your sisters appear righteous by all the abominations that you have committed."
Ezekiel,16,52,"Bear your disgrace, you also, for you have intervened on behalf of your sisters. Because of your sins in which you acted more abominably than they, they are more in the right than you. So be ashamed, you also, and bear your disgrace, for you have made your sisters appear righteous."
Ezekiel,16,53,"""I will restore their fortunes, both the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters, and I will restore your own fortunes in their midst,"
Ezekiel,16,54,"that you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all that you have done, becoming a consolation to them."
Ezekiel,16,55,"As for your sisters, Sodom and her daughters shall return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former state, and you and your daughters shall return to your former state."
Ezekiel,16,56,"Was not your sister Sodom a byword in your mouth in the day of your pride,"
Ezekiel,16,57,"before your wickedness was uncovered? Now you have become an object of reproach for the daughters of Syria and all those around her, and for the daughters of the Philistines, those all around who despise you."
Ezekiel,16,58,"You bear the penalty of your lewdness and your abominations, declares the LORD."
Ezekiel,16,59,"""For thus says the Lord GOD: I will deal with you as you have done, you who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant,"
Ezekiel,16,60,"yet I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish for you an everlasting covenant."
Ezekiel,16,61,"Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you take your sisters, both your elder and your younger, and I give them to you as daughters, but not on account of the covenant with you."
Ezekiel,16,62,"I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall know that I am the LORD,"
Ezekiel,16,63,"that you may remember and be confounded, and never open your mouth again because of your shame, when I atone for you for all that you have done, declares the Lord GOD."""
Ezekiel,17,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,17,2,"""Son of man, propound a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel;"
Ezekiel,17,3,"say, Thus says the Lord GOD: A great eagle with great wings and long pinions, rich in plumage of many colors, came to Lebanon and took the top of the cedar."
Ezekiel,17,4,He broke off the topmost of its young twigs and carried it to a land of trade and set it in a city of merchants.
Ezekiel,17,5,"Then he took of the seed of the land and planted it in fertile soil. He placed it beside abundant waters. He set it like a willow twig,"
Ezekiel,17,6,"and it sprouted and became a low spreading vine, and its branches turned toward him, and its roots remained where it stood. So it became a vine and produced branches and put out boughs."
Ezekiel,17,7,"""And there was another great eagle with great wings and much plumage, and behold, this vine bent its roots toward him and shot forth its branches toward him from the bed where it was planted, that he might water it."
Ezekiel,17,8,"It had been planted on good soil by abundant waters, that it might produce branches and bear fruit and become a noble vine."
Ezekiel,17,9,"""Say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Will it thrive? Will he not pull up its roots and cut off its fruit, so that it withers, so that all its fresh sprouting leaves wither? It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it from its roots."
Ezekiel,17,10,"Behold, it is planted; will it thrive? Will it not utterly wither when the east wind strikes it--wither away on the bed where it sprouted?"""
Ezekiel,17,11,Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,17,12,"""Say now to the rebellious house, Do you not know what these things mean? Tell them, behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took her king and her princes and brought them to him to Babylon."
Ezekiel,17,13,"And he took one of the royal offspring and made a covenant with him, putting him under oath (the chief men of the land he had taken away),"
Ezekiel,17,14,"that the kingdom might be humble and not lift itself up, and keep his covenant that it might stand."
Ezekiel,17,15,"But he rebelled against him by sending his ambassadors to Egypt, that they might give him horses and a large army. Will he thrive? Can one escape who does such things? Can he break the covenant and yet escape?"
Ezekiel,17,16,"""As I live, declares the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant with him he broke, in Babylon he shall die."
Ezekiel,17,17,"Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company will not help him in war, when mounds are cast up and siege walls built to cut off many lives."
Ezekiel,17,18,"He despised the oath in breaking the covenant, and behold, he gave his hand and did all these things; he shall not escape."
Ezekiel,17,19,"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: As I live, surely it is my oath that he despised, and my covenant that he broke. I will return it upon his head."
Ezekiel,17,20,"I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon and enter into judgment with him there for the treachery he has committed against me."
Ezekiel,17,21,"And all the pick of his troops shall fall by the sword, and the survivors shall be scattered to every wind, and you shall know that I am the LORD; I have spoken."""
Ezekiel,17,22,"Thus says the Lord GOD: ""I myself will take a sprig from the lofty top of the cedar and will set it out. I will break off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I myself will plant it on a high and lofty mountain."
Ezekiel,17,23,"On the mountain height of Israel will I plant it, that it may bear branches and produce fruit and become a noble cedar. And under it will dwell every kind of bird; in the shade of its branches birds of every sort will nest."
Ezekiel,17,24,"And all the trees of the field shall know that I am the LORD; I bring low the high tree, and make high the low tree, dry up the green tree, and make the dry tree flourish. I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will do it."""
Ezekiel,18,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,18,2,"""What do you mean by repeating this proverb concerning the land of Israel, 'The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge'?"
Ezekiel,18,3,"As I live, declares the Lord GOD, this proverb shall no more be used by you in Israel."
Ezekiel,18,4,"Behold, all souls are mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is mine: the soul who sins shall die."
Ezekiel,18,5,"""If a man is righteous and does what is just and right--"
Ezekiel,18,6,"if he does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor's wife or approach a woman in her time of menstrual impurity,"
Ezekiel,18,7,"does not oppress anyone, but restores to the debtor his pledge, commits no robbery, gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment,"
Ezekiel,18,8,"does not lend at interest or take any profit, withholds his hand from injustice, executes true justice between man and man,"
Ezekiel,18,9,"walks in my statutes, and keeps my rules by acting faithfully--he is righteous; he shall surely live, declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,18,10,"""If he fathers a son who is violent, a shedder of blood, who does any of these things"
Ezekiel,18,11,"(though he himself did none of these things), who even eats upon the mountains, defiles his neighbor's wife,"
Ezekiel,18,12,"oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not restore the pledge, lifts up his eyes to the idols, commits abomination,"
Ezekiel,18,13,"lends at interest, and takes profit; shall he then live? He shall not live. He has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon himself."
Ezekiel,18,14,"""Now suppose this man fathers a son who sees all the sins that his father has done; he sees, and does not do likewise:"
Ezekiel,18,15,"he does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor's wife,"
Ezekiel,18,16,"does not oppress anyone, exacts no pledge, commits no robbery, but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment,"
Ezekiel,18,17,"withholds his hand from iniquity, takes no interest or profit, obeys my rules, and walks in my statutes; he shall not die for his father's iniquity; he shall surely live."
Ezekiel,18,18,"As for his father, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother, and did what is not good among his people, behold, he shall die for his iniquity."
Ezekiel,18,19,"""Yet you say, 'Why should not the son suffer for the iniquity of the father?' When the son has done what is just and right, and has been careful to observe all my statutes, he shall surely live."
Ezekiel,18,20,"The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself."
Ezekiel,18,21,"""But if a wicked person turns away from all his sins that he has committed and keeps all my statutes and does what is just and right, he shall surely live; he shall not die."
Ezekiel,18,22,None of the transgressions that he has committed shall be remembered against him; for the righteousness that he has done he shall live.
Ezekiel,18,23,"Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked, declares the Lord GOD, and not rather that he should turn from his way and live?"
Ezekiel,18,24,"But when a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and does injustice and does the same abominations that the wicked person does, shall he live? None of the righteous deeds that he has done shall be remembered; for the treachery of which he is guilty and the sin he has committed, for them he shall die."
Ezekiel,18,25,"""Yet you say, 'The way of the Lord is not just.' Hear now, O house of Israel: Is my way not just? Is it not your ways that are not just?"
Ezekiel,18,26,"When a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and does injustice, he shall die for it; for the injustice that he has done he shall die."
Ezekiel,18,27,"Again, when a wicked person turns away from the wickedness he has committed and does what is just and right, he shall save his life."
Ezekiel,18,28,"Because he considered and turned away from all the transgressions that he had committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die."
Ezekiel,18,29,"Yet the house of Israel says, 'The way of the Lord is not just.' O house of Israel, are my ways not just? Is it not your ways that are not just?"
Ezekiel,18,30,"""Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, declares the Lord GOD. Repent and turn from all your transgressions, lest iniquity be your ruin."
Ezekiel,18,31,"Cast away from you all the transgressions that you have committed, and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! Why will you die, O house of Israel?"
Ezekiel,18,32,"For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Lord GOD; so turn, and live."""
Ezekiel,19,1,"And you, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,"
Ezekiel,19,2,and say: What was your mother? A lioness! Among lions she crouched; in the midst of young lions she reared her cubs.
Ezekiel,19,3,"And she brought up one of her cubs; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch prey; he devoured men."
Ezekiel,19,4,"The nations heard about him; he was caught in their pit, and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt."
Ezekiel,19,5,"When she saw that she waited in vain, that her hope was lost, she took another of her cubs and made him a young lion."
Ezekiel,19,6,"He prowled among the lions; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch prey; he devoured men,"
Ezekiel,19,7,"and seized their widows. He laid waste their cities, and the land was appalled and all who were in it at the sound of his roaring."
Ezekiel,19,8,Then the nations set against him from provinces on every side; they spread their net over him; he was taken in their pit.
Ezekiel,19,9,"With hooks they put him in a cage and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him into custody, that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel."
Ezekiel,19,10,"Your mother was like a vine in a vineyard planted by the water, fruitful and full of branches by reason of abundant water."
Ezekiel,19,11,Its strong stems became rulers' scepters; it towered aloft among the thick boughs; it was seen in its height with the mass of its branches.
Ezekiel,19,12,"But the vine was plucked up in fury, cast down to the ground; the east wind dried up its fruit; they were stripped off and withered. As for its strong stem, fire consumed it."
Ezekiel,19,13,"Now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land."
Ezekiel,19,14,"And fire has gone out from the stem of its shoots, has consumed its fruit, so that there remains in it no strong stem, no scepter for ruling.This is a lamentation and has become a lamentation."
Ezekiel,20,1,"In the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and sat before me."
Ezekiel,20,2,And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,20,3,"""Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD, Is it to inquire of me that you come? As I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you."
Ezekiel,20,4,"Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? Let them know the abominations of their fathers,"
Ezekiel,20,5,"and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: On the day when I chose Israel, I swore to the offspring of the house of Jacob, making myself known to them in the land of Egypt; I swore to them, saying, I am the LORD your God."
Ezekiel,20,6,"On that day I swore to them that I would bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most glorious of all lands."
Ezekiel,20,7,"And I said to them, Cast away the detestable things your eyes feast on, every one of you, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am the LORD your God."
Ezekiel,20,8,"But they rebelled against me and were not willing to listen to me. None of them cast away the detestable things their eyes feasted on, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt.""Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them and spend my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt."
Ezekiel,20,9,"But I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they lived, in whose sight I made myself known to them in bringing them out of the land of Egypt."
Ezekiel,20,10,So I led them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.
Ezekiel,20,11,"I gave them my statutes and made known to them my rules, by which, if a person does them, he shall live."
Ezekiel,20,12,"Moreover, I gave them my Sabbaths, as a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD who sanctifies them."
Ezekiel,20,13,"But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They did not walk in my statutes but rejected my rules, by which, if a person does them, he shall live; and my Sabbaths they greatly profaned.""Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to make a full end of them."
Ezekiel,20,14,"But I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out."
Ezekiel,20,15,"Moreover, I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land that I had given them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most glorious of all lands,"
Ezekiel,20,16,"because they rejected my rules and did not walk in my statutes, and profaned my Sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols."
Ezekiel,20,17,"Nevertheless, my eye spared them, and I did not destroy them or make a full end of them in the wilderness."
Ezekiel,20,18,"""And I said to their children in the wilderness, Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, nor keep their rules, nor defile yourselves with their idols."
Ezekiel,20,19,"I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and be careful to obey my rules,"
Ezekiel,20,20,"and keep my Sabbaths holy that they may be a sign between me and you, that you may know that I am the LORD your God."
Ezekiel,20,21,"But the children rebelled against me. They did not walk in my statutes and were not careful to obey my rules, by which, if a person does them, he shall live; they profaned my Sabbaths.""Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them and spend my anger against them in the wilderness."
Ezekiel,20,22,"But I withheld my hand and acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out."
Ezekiel,20,23,"Moreover, I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them through the countries,"
Ezekiel,20,24,"because they had not obeyed my rules, but had rejected my statutes and profaned my Sabbaths, and their eyes were set on their fathers' idols."
Ezekiel,20,25,"Moreover, I gave them statutes that were not good and rules by which they could not have life,"
Ezekiel,20,26,"and I defiled them through their very gifts in their offering up all their firstborn, that I might devastate them. I did it that they might know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,20,27,"""Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: In this also your fathers blasphemed me, by dealing treacherously with me."
Ezekiel,20,28,"For when I had brought them into the land that I swore to give them, then wherever they saw any high hill or any leafy tree, there they offered their sacrifices and there they presented the provocation of their offering; there they sent up their pleasing aromas, and there they poured out their drink offerings."
Ezekiel,20,29,"(I said to them, What is the high place to which you go? So its name is called Bamah to this day.)"
Ezekiel,20,30,"""Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: Will you defile yourselves after the manner of your fathers and go whoring after their detestable things?"
Ezekiel,20,31,"When you present your gifts and offer up your children in fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols to this day. And shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you."
Ezekiel,20,32,"""What is in your mind shall never happen--the thought, 'Let us be like the nations, like the tribes of the countries, and worship wood and stone.'"
Ezekiel,20,33,"""As I live, declares the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out I will be king over you."
Ezekiel,20,34,"I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you are scattered, with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out."
Ezekiel,20,35,"And I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face."
Ezekiel,20,36,"As I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you, declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,20,37,"I will make you pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant."
Ezekiel,20,38,"I will purge out the rebels from among you, and those who transgress against me. I will bring them out of the land where they sojourn, but they shall not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,20,39,"""As for you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord GOD: Go serve every one of you his idols, now and hereafter, if you will not listen to me; but my holy name you shall no more profane with your gifts and your idols."
Ezekiel,20,40,"""For on my holy mountain, the mountain height of Israel, declares the Lord GOD, there all the house of Israel, all of them, shall serve me in the land. There I will accept them, and there I will require your contributions and the choicest of your gifts, with all your sacred offerings."
Ezekiel,20,41,"As a pleasing aroma I will accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you have been scattered. And I will manifest my holiness among you in the sight of the nations."
Ezekiel,20,42,"And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I bring you into the land of Israel, the country that I swore to give to your fathers."
Ezekiel,20,43,"And there you shall remember your ways and all your deeds with which you have defiled yourselves, and you shall loathe yourselves for all the evils that you have committed."
Ezekiel,20,44,"And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I deal with you for my name's sake, not according to your evil ways, nor according to your corrupt deeds, O house of Israel, declares the Lord GOD."""
Ezekiel,20,45,And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,20,46,"""Son of man, set your face toward the southland; preach against the south, and prophesy against the forest land in the Negeb."
Ezekiel,20,47,"Say to the forest of the Negeb, Hear the word of the LORD: Thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you and every dry tree. The blazing flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from south to north shall be scorched by it."
Ezekiel,20,48,"All flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it; it shall not be quenched."""
Ezekiel,20,49,"Then I said, ""Ah, Lord GOD! They are saying of me, 'Is he not a maker of parables?'"""
Ezekiel,21,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,21,2,"""Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem and preach against the sanctuaries. Prophesy against the land of Israel"
Ezekiel,21,3,"and say to the land of Israel, Thus says the LORD: Behold, I am against you and will draw my sword from its sheath and will cut off from you both righteous and wicked."
Ezekiel,21,4,"Because I will cut off from you both righteous and wicked, therefore my sword shall be drawn from its sheath against all flesh from south to north."
Ezekiel,21,5,And all flesh shall know that I am the LORD. I have drawn my sword from its sheath; it shall not be sheathed again.
Ezekiel,21,6,"""As for you, son of man, groan; with breaking heart and bitter grief, groan before their eyes."
Ezekiel,21,7,"And when they say to you, 'Why do you groan?' you shall say, 'Because of the news that it is coming. Every heart will melt, and all hands will be feeble; every spirit will faint, and all knees will be weak as water. Behold, it is coming, and it will be fulfilled,'"" declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,21,8,And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,21,9,"""Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord; Say: ""A sword, a sword is sharpened and also polished,"
Ezekiel,21,10,"sharpened for slaughter, polished to flash like lightning!(Or shall we rejoice? You have despised the rod, my son, with everything of wood.)"
Ezekiel,21,11,"So the sword is given to be polished, that it may be grasped in the hand. It is sharpened and polished to be given into the hand of the slayer."
Ezekiel,21,12,"Cry out and wail, son of man, for it is against my people. It is against all the princes of Israel. They are delivered over to the sword with my people. Strike therefore upon your thigh."
Ezekiel,21,13,"For it will not be a testing--what could it do if you despise the rod?"" declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,21,14,"""As for you, son of man, prophesy. Clap your hands and let the sword come down twice, yes, three times, the sword for those to be slain. It is the sword for the great slaughter, which surrounds them,"
Ezekiel,21,15,"that their hearts may melt, and many stumble. At all their gates I have given the glittering sword. Ah, it is made like lightning; it is taken up for slaughter."
Ezekiel,21,16,"Cut sharply to the right; set yourself to the left, wherever your face is directed."
Ezekiel,21,17,"I also will clap my hands, and I will satisfy my fury; I the LORD have spoken."""
Ezekiel,21,18,The word of the LORD came to me again:
Ezekiel,21,19,"""As for you, son of man, mark two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to come. Both of them shall come from the same land. And make a signpost; make it at the head of the way to a city."
Ezekiel,21,20,"Mark a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the Ammonites and to Judah, into Jerusalem the fortified."
Ezekiel,21,21,"For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination. He shakes the arrows; he consults the teraphim; he looks at the liver."
Ezekiel,21,22,"Into his right hand comes the divination for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth with murder, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build siege towers."
Ezekiel,21,23,"But to them it will seem like a false divination. They have sworn solemn oaths, but he brings their guilt to remembrance, that they may be taken."
Ezekiel,21,24,"""Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have made your guilt to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your deeds your sins appear--because you have come to remembrance, you shall be taken in hand."
Ezekiel,21,25,"And you, O profane wicked one, prince of Israel, whose day has come, the time of your final punishment,"
Ezekiel,21,26,"thus says the Lord GOD: Remove the turban and take off the crown. Things shall not remain as they are. Exalt that which is low, and bring low that which is exalted."
Ezekiel,21,27,"A ruin, ruin, ruin I will make it. This also shall not be, until he comes, the one to whom judgment belongs, and I will give it to him."
Ezekiel,21,28,"""And you, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites and concerning their reproach; say, A sword, a sword is drawn for the slaughter. It is polished to consume and to flash like lightning--"
Ezekiel,21,29,"while they see for you false visions, while they divine lies for you--to place you on the necks of the profane wicked, whose day has come, the time of their final punishment."
Ezekiel,21,30,"Return it to its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your origin, I will judge you."
Ezekiel,21,31,"And I will pour out my indignation upon you; I will blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and I will deliver you into the hands of brutish men, skillful to destroy."
Ezekiel,21,32,"You shall be fuel for the fire. Your blood shall be in the midst of the land. You shall be no more remembered, for I the LORD have spoken."""
Ezekiel,22,1,"And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,22,2,"""And you, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? Then declare to her all her abominations."
Ezekiel,22,3,"You shall say, Thus says the Lord GOD: A city that sheds blood in her midst, so that her time may come, and that makes idols to defile herself!"
Ezekiel,22,4,"You have become guilty by the blood that you have shed, and defiled by the idols that you have made, and you have brought your days near, the appointed time of your years has come. Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations, and a mockery to all the countries."
Ezekiel,22,5,Those who are near and those who are far from you will mock you; your name is defiled; you are full of tumult.
Ezekiel,22,6,"""Behold, the princes of Israel in you, every one according to his power, have been bent on shedding blood."
Ezekiel,22,7,Father and mother are treated with contempt in you; the sojourner suffers extortion in your midst; the fatherless and the widow are wronged in you.
Ezekiel,22,8,You have despised my holy things and profaned my Sabbaths.
Ezekiel,22,9,"There are men in you who slander to shed blood, and people in you who eat on the mountains; they commit lewdness in your midst."
Ezekiel,22,10,In you men uncover their fathers' nakedness; in you they violate women who are unclean in their menstrual impurity.
Ezekiel,22,11,"One commits abomination with his neighbor's wife; another lewdly defiles his daughter-in-law; another in you violates his sister, his father's daughter."
Ezekiel,22,12,"In you they take bribes to shed blood; you take interest and profit and make gain of your neighbors by extortion; but me you have forgotten, declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,22,13,"""Behold, I strike my hand at the dishonest gain that you have made, and at the blood that has been in your midst."
Ezekiel,22,14,"Can your courage endure, or can your hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with you? I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it."
Ezekiel,22,15,"I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you through the countries, and I will consume your uncleanness out of you."
Ezekiel,22,16,"And you shall be profaned by your own doing in the sight of the nations, and you shall know that I am the LORD."""
Ezekiel,22,17,And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,22,18,"""Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me; all of them are bronze and tin and iron and lead in the furnace; they are dross of silver."
Ezekiel,22,19,"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have all become dross, therefore, behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,22,20,"As one gathers silver and bronze and iron and lead and tin into a furnace, to blow the fire on it in order to melt it, so I will gather you in my anger and in my wrath, and I will put you in and melt you."
Ezekiel,22,21,"I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of my wrath, and you shall be melted in the midst of it."
Ezekiel,22,22,"As silver is melted in a furnace, so you shall be melted in the midst of it, and you shall know that I am the LORD; I have poured out my wrath upon you."""
Ezekiel,22,23,And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,22,24,"""Son of man, say to her, You are a land that is not cleansed or rained upon in the day of indignation."
Ezekiel,22,25,The conspiracy of her prophets in her midst is like a roaring lion tearing the prey; they have devoured human lives; they have taken treasure and precious things; they have made many widows in her midst.
Ezekiel,22,26,"Her priests have done violence to my law and have profaned my holy things. They have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they taught the difference between the unclean and the clean, and they have disregarded my Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them."
Ezekiel,22,27,"Her princes in her midst are like wolves tearing the prey, shedding blood, destroying lives to get dishonest gain."
Ezekiel,22,28,"And her prophets have smeared whitewash for them, seeing false visions and divining lies for them, saying, 'Thus says the Lord GOD,' when the LORD has not spoken."
Ezekiel,22,29,"The people of the land have practiced extortion and committed robbery. They have oppressed the poor and needy, and have extorted from the sojourner without justice."
Ezekiel,22,30,"And I sought for a man among them who should build up the wall and stand in the breach before me for the land, that I should not destroy it, but I found none."
Ezekiel,22,31,"Therefore I have poured out my indignation upon them. I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath. I have returned their way upon their heads, declares the Lord GOD."""
Ezekiel,23,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,23,2,"""Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother."
Ezekiel,23,3,They played the whore in Egypt; they played the whore in their youth; there their breasts were pressed and their virgin bosoms handled.
Ezekiel,23,4,"Oholah was the name of the elder and Oholibah the name of her sister. They became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As for their names, Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,23,5,"""Oholah played the whore while she was mine, and she lusted after her lovers the Assyrians, warriors"
Ezekiel,23,6,"clothed in purple, governors and commanders, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses."
Ezekiel,23,7,"She bestowed her whoring upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them, and she defiled herself with all the idols of everyone after whom she lusted."
Ezekiel,23,8,She did not give up her whoring that she had begun in Egypt; for in her youth men had lain with her and handled her virgin bosom and poured out their whoring lust upon her.
Ezekiel,23,9,"Therefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of the Assyrians, after whom she lusted."
Ezekiel,23,10,"These uncovered her nakedness; they seized her sons and her daughters; and as for her, they killed her with the sword; and she became a byword among women, when judgment had been executed on her."
Ezekiel,23,11,"""Her sister Oholibah saw this, and she became more corrupt than her sister in her lust and in her whoring, which was worse than that of her sister."
Ezekiel,23,12,"She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and commanders, warriors clothed in full armor, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men."
Ezekiel,23,13,And I saw that she was defiled; they both took the same way.
Ezekiel,23,14,"But she carried her whoring further. She saw men portrayed on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed in vermilion,"
Ezekiel,23,15,"wearing belts on their waists, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them having the appearance of officers, a likeness of Babylonians whose native land was Chaldea."
Ezekiel,23,16,"When she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea."
Ezekiel,23,17,"And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoring lust. And after she was defiled by them, she turned from them in disgust."
Ezekiel,23,18,"When she carried on her whoring so openly and flaunted her nakedness, I turned in disgust from her, as I had turned in disgust from her sister."
Ezekiel,23,19,"Yet she increased her whoring, remembering the days of her youth, when she played the whore in the land of Egypt"
Ezekiel,23,20,"and lusted after her paramours there, whose members were like those of donkeys, and whose issue was like that of horses."
Ezekiel,23,21,"Thus you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians handled your bosom and pressed your young breasts."""
Ezekiel,23,22,"Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says the Lord GOD: ""Behold, I will stir up against you your lovers from whom you turned in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side:"
Ezekiel,23,23,"the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, desirable young men, governors and commanders all of them, officers and men of renown, all of them riding on horses."
Ezekiel,23,24,"And they shall come against you from the north with chariots and wagons and a host of peoples. They shall set themselves against you on every side with buckler, shield, and helmet; and I will commit the judgment to them, and they shall judge you according to their judgments."
Ezekiel,23,25,"And I will direct my jealousy against you, that they may deal with you in fury. They shall cut off your nose and your ears, and your survivors shall fall by the sword. They shall seize your sons and your daughters, and your survivors shall be devoured by fire."
Ezekiel,23,26,They shall also strip you of your clothes and take away your beautiful jewels.
Ezekiel,23,27,"Thus I will put an end to your lewdness and your whoring begun in the land of Egypt, so that you shall not lift up your eyes to them or remember Egypt anymore."
Ezekiel,23,28,"""For thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will deliver you into the hands of those whom you hate, into the hands of those from whom you turned in disgust,"
Ezekiel,23,29,"and they shall deal with you in hatred and take away all the fruit of your labor and leave you naked and bare, and the nakedness of your whoring shall be uncovered. Your lewdness and your whoring"
Ezekiel,23,30,"have brought this upon you, because you played the whore with the nations and defiled yourself with their idols."
Ezekiel,23,31,You have gone the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand.
Ezekiel,23,32,"Thus says the Lord GOD: ""You shall drink your sister's cup that is deep and large; you shall be laughed at and held in derision, for it contains much;"
Ezekiel,23,33,"you will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow. A cup of horror and desolation, the cup of your sister Samaria;"
Ezekiel,23,34,"you shall drink it and drain it out, and gnaw its shards, and tear your breasts;for I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,23,35,"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have forgotten me and cast me behind your back, you yourself must bear the consequences of your lewdness and whoring."""
Ezekiel,23,36,"The LORD said to me: ""Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Declare to them their abominations."
Ezekiel,23,37,"For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands. With their idols they have committed adultery, and they have even offered up to them for food the children whom they had borne to me."
Ezekiel,23,38,"Moreover, this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary on the same day and profaned my Sabbaths."
Ezekiel,23,39,"For when they had slaughtered their children in sacrifice to their idols, on the same day they came into my sanctuary to profane it. And behold, this is what they did in my house."
Ezekiel,23,40,"They even sent for men to come from afar, to whom a messenger was sent; and behold, they came. For them you bathed yourself, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with ornaments."
Ezekiel,23,41,"You sat on a stately couch, with a table spread before it on which you had placed my incense and my oil."
Ezekiel,23,42,"The sound of a carefree multitude was with her; and with men of the common sort drunkards were brought from the wilderness; and they put bracelets on the hands of the women, and beautiful crowns on their heads."
Ezekiel,23,43,"""Then I said of her who was worn out by adultery, Now they will continue to use her for a whore, even her!"
Ezekiel,23,44,"For they have gone in to her, as men go in to a prostitute. Thus they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, lewd women!"
Ezekiel,23,45,"But righteous men shall pass judgment on them with the sentence of adulteresses, and with the sentence of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses, and blood is on their hands."""
Ezekiel,23,46,"For thus says the Lord GOD: ""Bring up a vast host against them, and make them an object of terror and a plunder."
Ezekiel,23,47,"And the host shall stone them and cut them down with their swords. They shall kill their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses."
Ezekiel,23,48,"Thus will I put an end to lewdness in the land, that all women may take warning and not commit lewdness as you have done."
Ezekiel,23,49,"And they shall return your lewdness upon you, and you shall bear the penalty for your sinful idolatry, and you shall know that I am the Lord GOD."""
Ezekiel,24,1,"In the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:"
Ezekiel,24,2,"""Son of man, write down the name of this day, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day."
Ezekiel,24,3,"And utter a parable to the rebellious house and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: ""Set on the pot, set it on; pour in water also;"
Ezekiel,24,4,"put in it the pieces of meat, all the good pieces, the thigh and the shoulder; fill it with choice bones."
Ezekiel,24,5,Take the choicest one of the flock; pile the logs under it; boil it well; seethe also its bones in it.
Ezekiel,24,6,"""Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose corrosion is in it, and whose corrosion has not gone out of it! Take out of it piece after piece, without making any choice."
Ezekiel,24,7,For the blood she has shed is in her midst; she put it on the bare rock; she did not pour it out on the ground to cover it with dust.
Ezekiel,24,8,"To rouse my wrath, to take vengeance, I have set on the bare rock the blood she has shed, that it may not be covered."
Ezekiel,24,9,Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great.
Ezekiel,24,10,"Heap on the logs, kindle the fire, boil the meat well, mix in the spices, and let the bones be burned up."
Ezekiel,24,11,"Then set it empty upon the coals, that it may become hot, and its copper may burn, that its uncleanness may be melted in it, its corrosion consumed."
Ezekiel,24,12,She has wearied herself with toil; its abundant corrosion does not go out of it. Into the fire with its corrosion!
Ezekiel,24,13,"On account of your unclean lewdness, because I would have cleansed you and you were not cleansed from your uncleanness, you shall not be cleansed anymore till I have satisfied my fury upon you."
Ezekiel,24,14,"I am the LORD. I have spoken; it shall come to pass; I will do it. I will not go back; I will not spare; I will not relent; according to your ways and your deeds you will be judged, declares the Lord GOD."""
Ezekiel,24,15,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,24,16,"""Son of man, behold, I am about to take the delight of your eyes away from you at a stroke; yet you shall not mourn or weep, nor shall your tears run down."
Ezekiel,24,17,"Sigh, but not aloud; make no mourning for the dead. Bind on your turban, and put your shoes on your feet; do not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men."""
Ezekiel,24,18,"So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died. And on the next morning I did as I was commanded."
Ezekiel,24,19,"And the people said to me, ""Will you not tell us what these things mean for us, that you are acting thus?"""
Ezekiel,24,20,"Then I said to them, ""The word of the LORD came to me:"
Ezekiel,24,21,"'Say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the delight of your eyes, and the yearning of your soul, and your sons and your daughters whom you left behind shall fall by the sword."

Ezekiel,24,23,"Your turbans shall be on your heads and your shoes on your feet; you shall not mourn or weep, but you shall rot away in your iniquities and groan to one another."
Ezekiel,24,24,"Thus shall Ezekiel be to you a sign; according to all that he has done you shall do. When this comes, then you will know that I am the Lord GOD.'"
Ezekiel,24,25,"""As for you, son of man, surely on the day when I take from them their stronghold, their joy and glory, the delight of their eyes and their soul's desire, and also their sons and daughters,"
Ezekiel,24,26,on that day a fugitive will come to you to report to you the news.
Ezekiel,24,27,"On that day your mouth will be opened to the fugitive, and you shall speak and be no longer mute. So you will be a sign to them, and they will know that I am the LORD."""
Ezekiel,25,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,25,2,"""Son of man, set your face toward the Ammonites and prophesy against them."
Ezekiel,25,3,"Say to the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD: Thus says the Lord GOD, Because you said, 'Aha!' over my sanctuary when it was profaned, and over the land of Israel when it was made desolate, and over the house of Judah when they went into exile,"
Ezekiel,25,4,"therefore behold, I am handing you over to the people of the East for a possession, and they shall set their encampments among you and make their dwellings in your midst. They shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk."
Ezekiel,25,5,I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and Ammon a fold for flocks. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel,25,6,"For thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have clapped your hands and stamped your feet and rejoiced with all the malice within your soul against the land of Israel,"
Ezekiel,25,7,"therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand against you, and will hand you over as plunder to the nations. And I will cut you off from the peoples and will make you perish out of the countries; I will destroy you. Then you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,25,8,"""Thus says the Lord GOD: Because Moab and Seir said, 'Behold, the house of Judah is like all the other nations,'"

Ezekiel,25,10,"I will give it along with the Ammonites to the people of the East as a possession, that the Ammonites may be remembered no more among the nations,"
Ezekiel,25,11,and I will execute judgments upon Moab. Then they will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel,25,12,"""Thus says the Lord GOD: Because Edom acted revengefully against the house of Judah and has grievously offended in taking vengeance on them,"
Ezekiel,25,13,"therefore thus says the Lord GOD, I will stretch out my hand against Edom and cut off from it man and beast. And I will make it desolate; from Teman even to Dedan they shall fall by the sword."
Ezekiel,25,14,"And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel, and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and according to my wrath, and they shall know my vengeance, declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,25,15,"""Thus says the Lord GOD: Because the Philistines acted revengefully and took vengeance with malice of soul to destroy in never-ending enmity,"

Ezekiel,25,17,"I will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful rebukes. Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I lay my vengeance upon them."""
Ezekiel,26,1,"In the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:"
Ezekiel,26,2,"""Son of man, because Tyre said concerning Jerusalem, 'Aha, the gate of the peoples is broken; it has swung open to me. I shall be replenished, now that she is laid waste,'"

Ezekiel,26,4,"They shall destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers, and I will scrape her soil from her and make her a bare rock."
Ezekiel,26,5,"She shall be in the midst of the sea a place for the spreading of nets, for I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD. And she shall become plunder for the nations,"
Ezekiel,26,6,and her daughters on the mainland shall be killed by the sword. Then they will know that I am the LORD.

Ezekiel,26,9,"He will direct the shock of his battering rams against your walls, and with his axes he will break down your towers."
Ezekiel,26,10,"His horses will be so many that their dust will cover you. Your walls will shake at the noise of the horsemen and wagons and chariots, when he enters your gates as men enter a city that has been breached."
Ezekiel,26,11,"With the hoofs of his horses he will trample all your streets. He will kill your people with the sword, and your mighty pillars will fall to the ground."
Ezekiel,26,12,They will plunder your riches and loot your merchandise. They will break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses. Your stones and timber and soil they will cast into the midst of the waters.
Ezekiel,26,13,"And I will stop the music of your songs, and the sound of your lyres shall be heard no more."

Ezekiel,26,19,"""For thus says the Lord GOD: When I make you a city laid waste, like the cities that are not inhabited, when I bring up the deep over you, and the great waters cover you,"

Ezekiel,27,4,Your borders are in the heart of the seas; your builders made perfect your beauty.
Ezekiel,27,5,They made all your planks of fir trees from Senir; they took a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you.
Ezekiel,27,6,"Of oaks of Bashan they made your oars; they made your deck of pines from the coasts of Cyprus, inlaid with ivory."
Ezekiel,27,7,"Of fine embroidered linen from Egypt was your sail, serving as your banner; blue and purple from the coasts of Elishah was your awning."

Ezekiel,34,5,"So they were scattered, because there was no shepherd, and they became food for all the wild beasts."
Ezekiel,34,6,"My sheep were scattered; they wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. My sheep were scattered over all the face of the earth, with none to search or seek for them."
Ezekiel,34,7,"""Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:"
Ezekiel,34,8,"As I live, declares the Lord GOD, surely because my sheep have become a prey, and my sheep have become food for all the wild beasts, since there was no shepherd, and because my shepherds have not searched for my sheep, but the shepherds have fed themselves, and have not fed my sheep,"
Ezekiel,34,9,"therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:"
Ezekiel,34,10,"Thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will require my sheep at their hand and put a stop to their feeding the sheep. No longer shall the shepherds feed themselves. I will rescue my sheep from their mouths, that they may not be food for them."
Ezekiel,34,11,"""For thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I, I myself will search for my sheep and will seek them out."
Ezekiel,34,12,"As a shepherd seeks out his flock when he is among his sheep that have been scattered, so will I seek out my sheep, and I will rescue them from all places where they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness."
Ezekiel,34,13,"And I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land. And I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the ravines, and in all the inhabited places of the country."
Ezekiel,34,14,"I will feed them with good pasture, and on the mountain heights of Israel shall be their grazing land. There they shall lie down in good grazing land, and on rich pasture they shall feed on the mountains of Israel."
Ezekiel,34,15,"I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I myself will make them lie down, declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,34,16,"I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, and the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them in justice."
Ezekiel,34,17,"""As for you, my flock, thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and male goats."
Ezekiel,34,18,"Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture; and to drink of clear water, that you must muddy the rest of the water with your feet?"
Ezekiel,34,19,"And must my sheep eat what you have trodden with your feet, and drink what you have muddied with your feet?"
Ezekiel,34,20,"""Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD to them: Behold, I, I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep."
Ezekiel,34,21,"Because you push with side and shoulder, and thrust at all the weak with your horns, till you have scattered them abroad,"
Ezekiel,34,22,I will rescue my flock; they shall no longer be a prey. And I will judge between sheep and sheep.
Ezekiel,34,23,"And I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he shall feed them: he shall feed them and be their shepherd."
Ezekiel,34,24,"And I, the LORD, will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince among them. I am the LORD; I have spoken."
Ezekiel,34,25,"""I will make with them a covenant of peace and banish wild beasts from the land, so that they may dwell securely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods."
Ezekiel,34,26,"And I will make them and the places all around my hill a blessing, and I will send down the showers in their season; they shall be showers of blessing."
Ezekiel,34,27,"And the trees of the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall yield its increase, and they shall be secure in their land. And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I break the bars of their yoke, and deliver them from the hand of those who enslaved them."
Ezekiel,34,28,"They shall no more be a prey to the nations, nor shall the beasts of the land devour them. They shall dwell securely, and none shall make them afraid."
Ezekiel,34,29,"And I will provide for them renowned plantations so that they shall no more be consumed with hunger in the land, and no longer suffer the reproach of the nations."
Ezekiel,34,30,"And they shall know that I am the LORD their God with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,34,31,"And you are my sheep, human sheep of my pasture, and I am your God, declares the Lord GOD."""
Ezekiel,35,1,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,35,2,"""Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it,"
Ezekiel,35,3,"and say to it, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you, and I will make you a desolation and a waste."
Ezekiel,35,4,"I will lay your cities waste, and you shall become a desolation, and you shall know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,35,5,"Because you cherished perpetual enmity and gave over the people of Israel to the power of the sword at the time of their calamity, at the time of their final punishment,"
Ezekiel,35,6,"therefore, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will prepare you for blood, and blood shall pursue you; because you did not hate bloodshed, therefore blood shall pursue you."
Ezekiel,35,7,"I will make Mount Seir a waste and a desolation, and I will cut off from it all who come and go."
Ezekiel,35,8,And I will fill its mountains with the slain. On your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines those slain with the sword shall fall.
Ezekiel,35,9,"I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities shall not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,35,10,"""Because you said, 'These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will take possession of them'--although the LORD was there--"
Ezekiel,35,11,"therefore, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will deal with you according to the anger and envy that you showed because of your hatred against them. And I will make myself known among them, when I judge you."
Ezekiel,35,12,"And you shall know that I am the LORD.""I have heard all the revilings that you uttered against the mountains of Israel, saying, 'They are laid desolate; they are given us to devour.'"
Ezekiel,35,13,"And you magnified yourselves against me with your mouth, and multiplied your words against me; I heard it."
Ezekiel,35,14,"Thus says the Lord GOD: While the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate."
Ezekiel,35,15,"As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so I will deal with you; you shall be desolate, Mount Seir, and all Edom, all of it. Then they will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,36,1,"""And you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD."
Ezekiel,36,2,"Thus says the Lord GOD: Because the enemy said of you, 'Aha!' and, 'The ancient heights have become our possession,'"
Ezekiel,36,3,"therefore prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Precisely because they made you desolate and crushed you from all sides, so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations, and you became the talk and evil gossip of the people,"
Ezekiel,36,4,"therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD: Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains and the hills, the ravines and the valleys, the desolate wastes and the deserted cities, which have become a prey and derision to the rest of the nations all around,"
Ezekiel,36,5,"therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Surely I have spoken in my hot jealousy against the rest of the nations and against all Edom, who gave my land to themselves as a possession with wholehearted joy and utter contempt, that they might make its pasturelands a prey."
Ezekiel,36,6,"Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I have spoken in my jealous wrath, because you have suffered the reproach of the nations."
Ezekiel,36,7,Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: I swear that the nations that are all around you shall themselves suffer reproach.
Ezekiel,36,8,"""But you, O mountains of Israel, shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to my people Israel, for they will soon come home."

Ezekiel,36,11,"And I will multiply on you man and beast, and they shall multiply and be fruitful. And I will cause you to be inhabited as in your former times, and will do more good to you than ever before. Then you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,36,12,"I will let people walk on you, even my people Israel. And they shall possess you, and you shall be their inheritance, and you shall no longer bereave them of children."
Ezekiel,36,13,"Thus says the Lord GOD: Because they say to you, 'You devour people, and you bereave your nation of children,'"

Ezekiel,36,16,The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel,36,17,"""Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their own land, they defiled it by their ways and their deeds. Their ways before me were like the uncleanness of a woman in her menstrual impurity."
Ezekiel,36,18,"So I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood that they had shed in the land, for the idols with which they had defiled it."
Ezekiel,36,19,"I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries. In accordance with their ways and their deeds I judged them."
Ezekiel,36,20,"But when they came to the nations, wherever they came, they profaned my holy name, in that people said of them, 'These are the people of the LORD, and yet they had to go out of his land.'"
Ezekiel,36,21,"But I had concern for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations to which they came."
Ezekiel,36,22,"""Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you came."

Ezekiel,36,24,I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries and bring you into your own land.
Ezekiel,36,25,"I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you."
Ezekiel,36,26,"And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh."

Ezekiel,36,30,"I will make the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field abundant, that you may never again suffer the disgrace of famine among the nations."
Ezekiel,36,31,"Then you will remember your evil ways, and your deeds that were not good, and you will loathe yourselves for your iniquities and your abominations."
Ezekiel,36,32,"It is not for your sake that I will act, declares the Lord GOD; let that be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel."
Ezekiel,36,33,"""Thus says the Lord GOD: On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be rebuilt."

Ezekiel,36,35,"And they will say, 'This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden, and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are now fortified and inhabited.'"
Ezekiel,36,36,"Then the nations that are left all around you shall know that I am the LORD; I have rebuilt the ruined places and replanted that which was desolate. I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will do it."

Ezekiel,37,1,"The hand of the LORD was upon me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of the LORD and set me down in the middle of the valley; it was full of bones."
Ezekiel,37,2,"And he led me around among them, and behold, there were very many on the surface of the valley, and behold, they were very dry."
Ezekiel,37,3,"And he said to me, ""Son of man, can these bones live?"" And I answered, ""O Lord GOD, you know."""

Ezekiel,37,20,"When the sticks on which you write are in your hand before their eyes,"
Ezekiel,37,21,"then say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will take the people of Israel from the nations among which they have gone, and will gather them from all around, and bring them to their own land."
Ezekiel,37,22,"And I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel. And one king shall be king over them all, and they shall be no longer two nations, and no longer divided into two kingdoms."
Ezekiel,37,23,"They shall not defile themselves anymore with their idols and their detestable things, or with any of their transgressions. But I will save them from all the backslidings in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God."

Its people were brought out from the peoples and now dwell securely, all of them."

Ezekiel,40,19,"Then he measured the distance from the inner front of the lower gate to the outer front of the inner court, a hundred cubits on the east side and on the north side."
Ezekiel,40,20,"As for the gate that faced toward the north, belonging to the outer court, he measured its length and its breadth."
Ezekiel,40,21,"Its side rooms, three on either side, and its jambs and its vestibule were of the same size as those of the first gate. Its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits."
Ezekiel,40,22,"And its windows, its vestibule, and its palm trees were of the same size as those of the gate that faced toward the east. And by seven steps people would go up to it, and find its vestibule before them."
Ezekiel,40,23,"And opposite the gate on the north, as on the east, was a gate to the inner court. And he measured from gate to gate, a hundred cubits."
Ezekiel,40,24,"And he led me toward the south, and behold, there was a gate on the south. And he measured its jambs and its vestibule; they had the same size as the others."
Ezekiel,40,25,"Both it and its vestibule had windows all around, like the windows of the others. Its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits."
Ezekiel,40,26,"And there were seven steps leading up to it, and its vestibule was before them, and it had palm trees on its jambs, one on either side."
Ezekiel,40,27,"And there was a gate on the south of the inner court. And he measured from gate to gate toward the south, a hundred cubits."
Ezekiel,40,28,"Then he brought me to the inner court through the south gate, and he measured the south gate. It was of the same size as the others."
Ezekiel,40,29,"Its side rooms, its jambs, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others, and both it and its vestibule had windows all around. Its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits."
Ezekiel,40,30,"And there were vestibules all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits broad."
Ezekiel,40,31,"Its vestibule faced the outer court, and palm trees were on its jambs, and its stairway had eight steps."
Ezekiel,40,32,"Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured the gate. It was of the same size as the others."
Ezekiel,40,33,"Its side rooms, its jambs, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others, and both it and its vestibule had windows all around. Its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits."
Ezekiel,40,34,"Its vestibule faced the outer court, and it had palm trees on its jambs, on either side, and its stairway had eight steps."
Ezekiel,40,35,"Then he brought me to the north gate, and he measured it. It had the same size as the others."
Ezekiel,40,36,"Its side rooms, its jambs, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others, and it had windows all around. Its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits."
Ezekiel,40,37,"Its vestibule faced the outer court, and it had palm trees on its jambs, on either side, and its stairway had eight steps."
Ezekiel,40,38,"There was a chamber with its door in the vestibule of the gate, where the burnt offering was to be washed."
Ezekiel,40,39,"And in the vestibule of the gate were two tables on either side, on which the burnt offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering were to be slaughtered."
Ezekiel,40,40,"And off to the side, on the outside as one goes up to the entrance of the north gate, were two tables; and off to the other side of the vestibule of the gate were two tables."
Ezekiel,40,41,"Four tables were on either side of the gate, eight tables, on which to slaughter."
Ezekiel,40,42,"And there were four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high, on which the instruments were to be laid with which the burnt offerings and the sacrifices were slaughtered."
Ezekiel,40,43,"And hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened all around within. And on the tables the flesh of the offering was to be laid."
Ezekiel,40,44,"On the outside of the inner gateway there were two chambers in the inner court, one at the side of the north gate facing south, the other at the side of the south gate facing north."
Ezekiel,40,45,"And he said to me, This chamber that faces south is for the priests who have charge of the temple,"
Ezekiel,40,46,"and the chamber that faces north is for the priests who have charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who alone among the sons of Levi may come near to the LORD to minister to him."
Ezekiel,40,47,"And he measured the court, a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits broad, a square. And the altar was in front of the temple."
Ezekiel,40,48,"Then he brought me to the vestibule of the temple and measured the jambs of the vestibule, five cubits on either side. And the breadth of the gate was fourteen cubits, and the sidewalls of the gate were three cubits on either side."
Ezekiel,40,49,"The length of the vestibule was twenty cubits, and the breadth twelve cubits, and people would go up to it by ten steps. And there were pillars beside the jambs, one on either side."
Ezekiel,41,1,Then he brought me to the nave and measured the jambs. On each side six cubits was the breadth of the jambs.
Ezekiel,41,2,"And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits, and the sidewalls of the entrance were five cubits on either side. And he measured the length of the nave, forty cubits, and its breadth, twenty cubits."
Ezekiel,41,3,"Then he went into the inner room and measured the jambs of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the sidewalls on either side of the entrance, seven cubits."
Ezekiel,41,4,"And he measured the length of the room, twenty cubits, and its breadth, twenty cubits, across the nave. And he said to me, ""This is the Most Holy Place."""
Ezekiel,41,5,"Then he measured the wall of the temple, six cubits thick, and the breadth of the side chambers, four cubits, all around the temple."
Ezekiel,41,6,"And the side chambers were in three stories, one over another, thirty in each story. There were offsets all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for the side chambers, so that they should not be supported by the wall of the temple."
Ezekiel,41,7,"And it became broader as it wound upward to the side chambers, because the temple was enclosed upward all around the temple. Thus the temple had a broad area upward, and so one went up from the lowest story to the top story through the middle story."
Ezekiel,41,8,I saw also that the temple had a raised platform all around; the foundations of the side chambers measured a full reed of six long cubits.
Ezekiel,41,9,The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits. The free space between the side chambers of the temple and the
Ezekiel,41,10,other chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits all around the temple on every side.
Ezekiel,41,11,"And the doors of the side chambers opened on the free space, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south. And the breadth of the free space was five cubits all around."
Ezekiel,41,12,"The building that was facing the separate yard on the west side was seventy cubits broad, and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits."
Ezekiel,41,13,"Then he measured the temple, a hundred cubits long; and the yard and the building with its walls, a hundred cubits long;"
Ezekiel,41,14,"also the breadth of the east front of the temple and the yard, a hundred cubits."
Ezekiel,41,15,"Then he measured the length of the building facing the yard that was at the back and its galleries on either side, a hundred cubits.The inside of the nave and the vestibules of the court,"
Ezekiel,41,16,"the thresholds and the narrow windows and the galleries all around the three of them, opposite the threshold, were paneled with wood all around, from the floor up to the windows (now the windows were covered),"
Ezekiel,41,17,"to the space above the door, even to the inner room, and on the outside. And on all the walls all around, inside and outside, was a measured pattern."
Ezekiel,41,18,"It was carved of cherubim and palm trees, a palm tree between cherub and cherub. Every cherub had two faces:"
Ezekiel,41,19,"a human face toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved on the whole temple all around."
Ezekiel,41,20,"From the floor to above the door, cherubim and palm trees were carved; similarly the wall of the nave."
Ezekiel,41,21,"The doorposts of the nave were squared, and in front of the Holy Place was something resembling"
Ezekiel,41,22,"an altar of wood, three cubits high, two cubits long, and two cubits broad. Its corners, its base, and its walls were of wood. He said to me, ""This is the table that is before the LORD."""
Ezekiel,41,23,The nave and the Holy Place had each a double door.
Ezekiel,41,24,"The double doors had two leaves apiece, two swinging leaves for each door."
Ezekiel,41,25,"And on the doors of the nave were carved cherubim and palm trees, such as were carved on the walls. And there was a canopy of wood in front of the vestibule outside."
Ezekiel,41,26,"And there were narrow windows and palm trees on either side, on the sidewalls of the vestibule, the side chambers of the temple, and the canopies."
Ezekiel,42,1,"Then he led me out into the outer court, toward the north, and he brought me to the chambers that were opposite the separate yard and opposite the building on the north."
Ezekiel,42,2,"The length of the building whose door faced north was a hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty cubits."
Ezekiel,42,3,"Facing the twenty cubits that belonged to the inner court, and facing the pavement that belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in three stories."
Ezekiel,42,4,"And before the chambers was a passage inward, ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits long, and their doors were on the north."
Ezekiel,42,5,"Now the upper chambers were narrower, for the galleries took more away from them than from the lower and middle chambers of the building."
Ezekiel,42,6,"For they were in three stories, and they had no pillars like the pillars of the courts. Thus the upper chambers were set back from the ground more than the lower and the middle ones."
Ezekiel,42,7,"And there was a wall outside parallel to the chambers, toward the outer court, opposite the chambers, fifty cubits long."
Ezekiel,42,8,"For the chambers on the outer court were fifty cubits long, while those opposite the nave were a hundred cubits long."
Ezekiel,42,9,"Below these chambers was an entrance on the east side, as one enters them from the outer court."
Ezekiel,42,10,"In the thickness of the wall of the court, on the south also, opposite the yard and opposite the building, there were chambers"
Ezekiel,42,11,"with a passage in front of them. They were similar to the chambers on the north, of the same length and breadth, with the same exits and arrangements and doors,"
Ezekiel,42,12,"as were the entrances of the chambers on the south. There was an entrance at the beginning of the passage, the passage before the corresponding wall on the east as one enters them."
Ezekiel,42,13,"Then he said to me, ""The north chambers and the south chambers opposite the yard are the holy chambers, where the priests who approach the LORD shall eat the most holy offerings. There they shall put the most holy offerings--the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering, for the place is holy."
Ezekiel,42,14,"When the priests enter the Holy Place, they shall not go out of it into the outer court without laying there the garments in which they minister, for these are holy. They shall put on other garments before they go near to that which is for the people."""
Ezekiel,42,15,"Now when he had finished measuring the interior of the temple area, he led me out by the gate that faced east, and measured the temple area all around."
Ezekiel,42,16,"He measured the east side with the measuring reed, 500 cubits by the measuring reed all around."
Ezekiel,42,17,"He measured the north side, 500 cubits by the measuring reed all around."
Ezekiel,42,18,"He measured the south side, 500 cubits by the measuring reed."
Ezekiel,42,19,"Then he turned to the west side and measured, 500 cubits by the measuring reed."
Ezekiel,42,20,"He measured it on the four sides. It had a wall around it, 500 cubits long and 500 cubits broad, to make a separation between the holy and the common."
Ezekiel,43,1,"Then he led me to the gate, the gate facing east."
Ezekiel,43,2,"And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the east. And the sound of his coming was like the sound of many waters, and the earth shone with his glory."
Ezekiel,43,3,"And the vision I saw was just like the vision that I had seen when he came to destroy the city, and just like the vision that I had seen by the Chebar canal. And I fell on my face."
Ezekiel,43,4,"As the glory of the LORD entered the temple by the gate facing east,"
Ezekiel,43,5,"the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the temple."
Ezekiel,43,6,"While the man was standing beside me, I heard one speaking to me out of the temple,"
Ezekiel,43,7,"and he said to me, ""Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the people of Israel forever. And the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoring and by the dead bodies of their kings at their high places,"
Ezekiel,43,8,"by setting their threshold by my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them. They have defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed, so I have consumed them in my anger."
Ezekiel,43,9,"Now let them put away their whoring and the dead bodies of their kings far from me, and I will dwell in their midst forever."
Ezekiel,43,10,"""As for you, son of man, describe to the house of Israel the temple, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and they shall measure the plan."
Ezekiel,43,11,"And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the temple, its arrangement, its exits and its entrances, that is, its whole design; and make known to them as well all its statutes and its whole design and all its laws, and write it down in their sight, so that they may observe all its laws and all its statutes and carry them out."
Ezekiel,43,12,"This is the law of the temple: the whole territory on the top of the mountain all around shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the temple."
Ezekiel,43,13,"""These are the measurements of the altar by cubits (the cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth): its base shall be one cubit high and one cubit broad, with a rim of one span around its edge. And this shall be the height of the altar:"
Ezekiel,43,14,"from the base on the ground to the lower ledge, two cubits, with a breadth of one cubit; and from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge, four cubits, with a breadth of one cubit;"
Ezekiel,43,15,"and the altar hearth, four cubits; and from the altar hearth projecting upward, four horns."
Ezekiel,43,16,"The altar hearth shall be square, twelve cubits long by twelve broad."
Ezekiel,43,17,"The ledge also shall be square, fourteen cubits long by fourteen broad, with a rim around it half a cubit broad, and its base one cubit all around. The steps of the altar shall face east."""
Ezekiel,43,18,"And he said to me, ""Son of man, thus says the Lord GOD: These are the ordinances for the altar: On the day when it is erected for offering burnt offerings upon it and for throwing blood against it,"
Ezekiel,43,19,"you shall give to the Levitical priests of the family of Zadok, who draw near to me to minister to me, declares the Lord GOD, a bull from the herd for a sin offering."
Ezekiel,43,20,And you shall take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar and on the four corners of the ledge and upon the rim all around. Thus you shall purify the altar and make atonement for it.
Ezekiel,43,21,"You shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and it shall be burned in the appointed place belonging to the temple, outside the sacred area."
Ezekiel,43,22,"And on the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish for a sin offering; and the altar shall be purified, as it was purified with the bull."
Ezekiel,43,23,"When you have finished purifying it, you shall offer a bull from the herd without blemish and a ram from the flock without blemish."
Ezekiel,43,24,"You shall present them before the LORD, and the priests shall sprinkle salt on them and offer them up as a burnt offering to the LORD."
Ezekiel,43,25,"For seven days you shall provide daily a male goat for a sin offering; also, a bull from the herd and a ram from the flock, without blemish, shall be provided."
Ezekiel,43,26,"Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and cleanse it, and so consecrate it."
Ezekiel,43,27,"And when they have completed these days, then from the eighth day onward the priests shall offer on the altar your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, and I will accept you, declares the Lord GOD."""
Ezekiel,44,1,"Then he brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary, which faces east. And it was shut."
Ezekiel,44,2,"And the LORD said to me, ""This gate shall remain shut; it shall not be opened, and no one shall enter by it, for the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered by it. Therefore it shall remain shut."
Ezekiel,44,3,"Only the prince may sit in it to eat bread before the LORD. He shall enter by way of the vestibule of the gate, and shall go out by the same way."""
Ezekiel,44,4,"Then he brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple, and I looked, and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the temple of the LORD. And I fell on my face."
Ezekiel,44,5,"And the LORD said to me, ""Son of man, mark well, see with your eyes, and hear with your ears all that I shall tell you concerning all the statutes of the temple of the LORD and all its laws. And mark well the entrance to the temple and all the exits from the sanctuary."
Ezekiel,44,6,"And say to the rebellious house, to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: O house of Israel, enough of all your abominations,"
Ezekiel,44,7,"in admitting foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and flesh, to be in my sanctuary, profaning my temple, when you offer to me my food, the fat and the blood. You have broken my covenant, in addition to all your abominations."
Ezekiel,44,8,"And you have not kept charge of my holy things, but you have set others to keep my charge for you in my sanctuary."
Ezekiel,44,9,"""Thus says the Lord GOD: No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and flesh, of all the foreigners who are among the people of Israel, shall enter my sanctuary."
Ezekiel,44,10,"But the Levites who went far from me, going astray from me after their idols when Israel went astray, shall bear their punishment."
Ezekiel,44,11,"They shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the temple and ministering in the temple. They shall slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before the people, to minister to them."
Ezekiel,44,12,"Because they ministered to them before their idols and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel, therefore I have sworn concerning them, declares the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their punishment."
Ezekiel,44,13,"They shall not come near to me, to serve me as priest, nor come near any of my holy things and the things that are most holy, but they shall bear their shame and the abominations that they have committed."
Ezekiel,44,14,"Yet I will appoint them to keep charge of the temple, to do all its service and all that is to be done in it."
Ezekiel,44,15,"""But the Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who kept the charge of my sanctuary when the people of Israel went astray from me, shall come near to me to minister to me. And they shall stand before me to offer me the fat and the blood, declares the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,44,16,"They shall enter my sanctuary, and they shall approach my table, to minister to me, and they shall keep my charge."

Ezekiel,44,18,"They shall have linen turbans on their heads, and linen undergarments around their waists. They shall not bind themselves with anything that causes sweat."
Ezekiel,44,19,"And when they go out into the outer court to the people, they shall put off the garments in which they have been ministering and lay them in the holy chambers. And they shall put on other garments, lest they communicate holiness to the people with their garments."
Ezekiel,44,20,They shall not shave their heads or let their locks grow long; they shall surely trim the hair of their heads.
Ezekiel,44,21,No priest shall drink wine when he enters the inner court.
Ezekiel,44,22,"They shall not marry a widow or a divorced woman, but only virgins of the offspring of the house of Israel, or a widow who is the widow of a priest."
Ezekiel,44,23,"They shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and show them how to distinguish between the unclean and the clean."

Ezekiel,44,25,"They shall not defile themselves by going near to a dead person. However, for father or mother, for son or daughter, for brother or unmarried sister they may defile themselves."
Ezekiel,44,26,"After he has become clean, they shall count seven days for him."
Ezekiel,44,27,"And on the day that he goes into the Holy Place, into the inner court, to minister in the Holy Place, he shall offer his sin offering, declares the Lord GOD."

Ezekiel,45,1,"""When you allot the land as an inheritance, you shall set apart for the LORD a portion of the land as a holy district, 25,000 cubits long and 20,000 cubits broad. It shall be holy throughout its whole extent."
Ezekiel,45,2,"Of this a square plot of 500 by 500 cubits shall be for the sanctuary, with fifty cubits for an open space around it."
Ezekiel,45,3,"And from this measured district you shall measure off a section 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 broad, in which shall be the sanctuary, the Most Holy Place."
Ezekiel,45,4,"It shall be the holy portion of the land. It shall be for the priests, who minister in the sanctuary and approach the LORD to minister to him, and it shall be a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary."
Ezekiel,45,5,"Another section, 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits broad, shall be for the Levites who minister at the temple, as their possession for cities to live in."

Ezekiel,46,10,"When they enter, the prince shall enter with them, and when they go out, he shall go out."
Ezekiel,46,11,"""At the feasts and the appointed festivals, the grain offering with a young bull shall be an ephah, and with a ram an ephah, and with the lambs as much as one is able to give, together with a hin of oil to an ephah."
Ezekiel,46,12,"When the prince provides a freewill offering, either a burnt offering or peace offerings as a freewill offering to the LORD, the gate facing east shall be opened for him.

Ezekiel,46,16,"""Thus says the Lord GOD: If the prince makes a gift to any of his sons as his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons. It is their property by inheritance."
Ezekiel,46,17,"But if he makes a gift out of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty. Then it shall revert to the prince; surely it is his inheritance--it shall belong to his sons."
Ezekiel,46,18,"The prince shall not take any of the inheritance of the people, thrusting them out of their property. He shall give his sons their inheritance out of his own property, so that none of my people shall be scattered from his property."""
Ezekiel,46,19,"Then he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, to the north row of the holy chambers for the priests, and behold, a place was there at the extreme western end of them."
Ezekiel,46,20,"And he said to me, ""This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the grain offering, in order not to bring them out into the outer court and so communicate holiness to the people."""
Ezekiel,46,21,"Then he brought me out to the outer court and led me around to the four corners of the court. And behold, in each corner of the court there was another court--"
Ezekiel,46,22,"in the four corners of the court were small courts, forty cubits long and thirty broad; the four were of the same size."
Ezekiel,46,23,"On the inside, around each of the four courts was a row of masonry, with hearths made at the bottom of the rows all around."
Ezekiel,46,24,"Then he said to me, ""These are the kitchens where those who minister at the temple shall boil the sacrifices of the people."""
Ezekiel,47,1,"Then he brought me back to the door of the temple, and behold, water was issuing from below the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east). The water was flowing down from below the south end of the threshold of the temple, south of the altar."
Ezekiel,47,2,"Then he brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around on the outside to the outer gate that faces toward the east; and behold, the water was trickling out on the south side."
Ezekiel,47,3,"Going on eastward with a measuring line in his hand, the man measured a thousand cubits, and then led me through the water, and it was ankle-deep."
Ezekiel,47,4,"Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water, and it was knee-deep. Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water, and it was waist-deep."
Ezekiel,47,5,"Again he measured a thousand, and it was a river that I could not pass through, for the water had risen. It was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be passed through."
Ezekiel,47,6,"And he said to me, ""Son of man, have you seen this?""Then he led me back to the bank of the river."
Ezekiel,47,7,"As I went back, I saw on the bank of the river very many trees on the one side and on the other."
Ezekiel,47,8,"And he said to me, ""This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah, and enters the sea; when the water flows into the sea, the water will become fresh."
Ezekiel,47,9,"And wherever the river goes, every living creature that swarms will live, and there will be very many fish. For this water goes there, that the waters of the sea may become fresh; so everything will live where the river goes."
Ezekiel,47,10,"Fishermen will stand beside the sea. From Engedi to Eneglaim it will be a place for the spreading of nets. Its fish will be of very many kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea."
Ezekiel,47,11,But its swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they are to be left for salt.
Ezekiel,47,12,"And on the banks, on both sides of the river, there will grow all kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither, nor their fruit fail, but they will bear fresh fruit every month, because the water for them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for healing."""

Daniel,1,1,"In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it."
Daniel,1,2,"And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with some of the vessels of the house of God. And he brought them to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god, and placed the vessels in the treasury of his god."
Daniel,1,3,"Then the king commanded Ashpenaz, his chief eunuch, to bring some of the people of Israel, both of the royal family and of the nobility,"
Daniel,1,4,"youths without blemish, of good appearance and skillful in all wisdom, endowed with knowledge, understanding learning, and competent to stand in the king's palace, and to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans."
Daniel,1,5,"The king assigned them a daily portion of the food that the king ate, and of the wine that he drank. They were to be educated for three years, and at the end of that time they were to stand before the king."
Daniel,1,6,"Among these were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah of the tribe of Judah."
Daniel,1,7,"And the chief of the eunuchs gave them names: Daniel he called Belteshazzar, Hananiah he called Shadrach, Mishael he called Meshach, and Azariah he called Abednego."
Daniel,1,8,"But Daniel resolved that he would not defile himself with the king's food, or with the wine that he drank. Therefore he asked the chief of the eunuchs to allow him not to defile himself."
Daniel,1,9,"And God gave Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs,"
Daniel,1,10,"and the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, ""I fear my lord the king, who assigned your food and your drink; for why should he see that you were in worse condition than the youths who are of your own age? So you would endanger my head with the king."""
Daniel,1,11,"Then Daniel said to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had assigned over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,"
Daniel,1,12,"""Test your servants for ten days; let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink."
Daniel,1,13,"Then let our appearance and the appearance of the youths who eat the king's food be observed by you, and deal with your servants according to what you see."""
Daniel,1,14,"So he listened to them in this matter, and tested them for ten days."
Daniel,1,15,At the end of ten days it was seen that they were better in appearance and fatter in flesh than all the youths who ate the king's food.
Daniel,1,16,"So the steward took away their food and the wine they were to drink, and gave them vegetables."
Daniel,1,17,"As for these four youths, God gave them learning and skill in all literature and wisdom, and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams."
Daniel,1,18,"At the end of the time, when the king had commanded that they should be brought in, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar."
Daniel,1,19,"And the king spoke with them, and among all of them none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Therefore they stood before the king."
Daniel,1,20,"And in every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his kingdom."
Daniel,1,21,And Daniel was there until the first year of King Cyrus.
Daniel,2,1,"In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; his spirit was troubled, and his sleep left him."
Daniel,2,2,"Then the king commanded that the magicians, the enchanters, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans be summoned to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king."
Daniel,2,3,"And the king said to them, ""I had a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream."""
Daniel,2,4,"Then the Chaldeans said to the king in Aramaic, ""O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation."""
Daniel,2,5,"The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, ""The word from me is firm: if you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you shall be torn limb from limb, and your houses shall be laid in ruins."
Daniel,2,6,"But if you show the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. Therefore show me the dream and its interpretation."""
Daniel,2,7,"They answered a second time and said, ""Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show its interpretation."""
Daniel,2,8,"The king answered and said, ""I know with certainty that you are trying to gain time, because you see that the word from me is firm--"
Daniel,2,9,"if you do not make the dream known to me, there is but one sentence for you. You have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me till the times change. Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can show me its interpretation."""
Daniel,2,10,"The Chaldeans answered the king and said, ""There is not a man on earth who can meet the king's demand, for no great and powerful king has asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or Chaldean."
Daniel,2,11,"The thing that the king asks is difficult, and no one can show it to the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh."""
Daniel,2,12,"Because of this the king was angry and very furious, and commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed."
Daniel,2,13,"So the decree went out, and the wise men were about to be killed; and they sought Daniel and his companions, to kill them."
Daniel,2,14,"Then Daniel replied with prudence and discretion to Arioch, the captain of the king's guard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon."
Daniel,2,15,"He declared to Arioch, the king's captain, ""Why is the decree of the king so urgent?"" Then Arioch made the matter known to Daniel."
Daniel,2,16,"And Daniel went in and requested the king to appoint him a time, that he might show the interpretation to the king."
Daniel,2,17,"Then Daniel went to his house and made the matter known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions,"
Daniel,2,18,"and told them to seek mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions might not be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon."
Daniel,2,19,Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
Daniel,2,20,"Daniel answered and said: ""Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, to whom belong wisdom and might."
Daniel,2,21,He changes times and seasons; he removes kings and sets up kings; he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding;
Daniel,2,22,"he reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him."
Daniel,2,23,"To you, O God of my fathers, I give thanks and praise, for you have given me wisdom and might, and have now made known to me what we asked of you, for you have made known to us the king's matter."""
Daniel,2,24,"Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went and said thus to him, ""Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show the king the interpretation."""
Daniel,2,25,"Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said thus to him: ""I have found among the exiles from Judah a man who will make known to the king the interpretation."""
Daniel,2,26,"The king said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, ""Are you able to make known to me the dream that I have seen and its interpretation?"""
Daniel,2,27,"Daniel answered the king and said, ""No wise men, enchanters, magicians, or astrologers can show to the king the mystery that the king has asked,"
Daniel,2,28,"but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days. Your dream and the visions of your head as you lay in bed are these:"
Daniel,2,29,"To you, O king, as you lay in bed came thoughts of what would be after this, and he who reveals mysteries made known to you what is to be."
Daniel,2,30,"But as for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because of any wisdom that I have more than all the living, but in order that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your mind."
Daniel,2,31,"""You saw, O king, and behold, a great image. This image, mighty and of exceeding brightness, stood before you, and its appearance was frightening."
Daniel,2,32,"The head of this image was of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its middle and thighs of bronze,"
Daniel,2,33,"its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay."
Daniel,2,34,"As you looked, a stone was cut out by no human hand, and it struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces."
Daniel,2,35,"Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold, all together were broken in pieces, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, so that not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth."
Daniel,2,36,"""This was the dream. Now we will tell the king its interpretation."
Daniel,2,37,"You, O king, the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the might, and the glory,"
Daniel,2,38,"and into whose hand he has given, wherever they dwell, the children of man, the beasts of the field, and the birds of the heavens, making you rule over them all--you are the head of gold."
Daniel,2,39,"Another kingdom inferior to you shall arise after you, and yet a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth."
Daniel,2,40,"And there shall be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron, because iron breaks to pieces and shatters all things. And like iron that crushes, it shall break and crush all these."
Daniel,2,41,"And as you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter's clay and partly of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom, but some of the firmness of iron shall be in it, just as you saw iron mixed with the soft clay."
Daniel,2,42,"And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly brittle."
Daniel,2,43,"As you saw the iron mixed with soft clay, so they will mix with one another in marriage, but they will not hold together, just as iron does not mix with clay."
Daniel,2,44,"And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, nor shall the kingdom be left to another people. It shall break in pieces all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, and it shall stand forever,"
Daniel,2,45,"just as you saw that a stone was cut from a mountain by no human hand, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold. A great God has made known to the king what shall be after this. The dream is certain, and its interpretation sure."""
Daniel,2,46,"Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and paid homage to Daniel, and commanded that an offering and incense be offered up to him."
Daniel,2,47,"The king answered and said to Daniel, ""Truly, your God is God of gods and Lord of kings, and a revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal this mystery."""
Daniel,2,48,"Then the king gave Daniel high honors and many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon."
Daniel,2,49,"Daniel made a request of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon. But Daniel remained at the king's court."
Daniel,3,1,"King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits and its breadth six cubits. He set it up on the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon."
Daniel,3,2,"Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent to gather the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up."
Daniel,3,3,"Then the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces gathered for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. And they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up."
Daniel,3,4,"And the herald proclaimed aloud, ""You are commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages,"
Daniel,3,5,"that when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up."
Daniel,3,6,"And whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace."""
Daniel,3,7,"Therefore, as soon as all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, all the peoples, nations, and languages fell down and worshiped the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up."
Daniel,3,8,Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and maliciously accused the Jews.
Daniel,3,9,"They declared to King Nebuchadnezzar, ""O king, live forever!"
Daniel,3,10,"You, O king, have made a decree, that every man who hears the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image."
Daniel,3,11,And whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into a burning fiery furnace.
Daniel,3,12,"There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, pay no attention to you; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up."""
Daniel,3,13,"Then Nebuchadnezzar in furious rage commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought. So they brought these men before the king."
Daniel,3,14,"Nebuchadnezzar answered and said to them, ""Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image that I have set up?"
Daniel,3,15,"Now if you are ready when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, to fall down and worship the image that I have made, well and good. But if you do not worship, you shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace. And who is the god who will deliver you out of my hands?"""
Daniel,3,16,"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, ""O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter."
Daniel,3,17,"If this be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king."
Daniel,3,18,"But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up."""
Daniel,3,19,"Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with fury, and the expression of his face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He ordered the furnace heated seven times more than it was usually heated."
Daniel,3,20,"And he ordered some of the mighty men of his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace."
Daniel,3,21,"Then these men were bound in their cloaks, their tunics, their hats, and their other garments, and they were thrown into the burning fiery furnace."
Daniel,3,22,"Because the king's order was urgent and the furnace overheated, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego."
Daniel,3,23,"And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell bound into the burning fiery furnace."
Daniel,3,24,"Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished and rose up in haste. He declared to his counselors, ""Did we not cast three men bound into the fire?"" They answered and said to the king, ""True, O king."""
Daniel,3,25,"He answered and said, ""But I see four men unbound, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are not hurt; and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods."""
Daniel,3,26,"Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the burning fiery furnace; he declared, ""Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out, and come here!"" Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out from the fire."
Daniel,3,27,"And the satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the king's counselors gathered together and saw that the fire had not had any power over the bodies of those men. The hair of their heads was not singed, their cloaks were not harmed, and no smell of fire had come upon them."
Daniel,3,28,"Nebuchadnezzar answered and said, ""Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants, who trusted in him, and set aside the king's command, and yielded up their bodies rather than serve and worship any god except their own God."
Daniel,3,29,"Therefore I make a decree: Any people, nation, or language that speaks anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be torn limb from limb, and their houses laid in ruins, for there is no other god who is able to rescue in this way."""
Daniel,3,30,"Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon."
Daniel,4,1,"King Nebuchadnezzar to all peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you!"
Daniel,4,2,It has seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God has done for me.
Daniel,4,3,"How great are his signs, how mighty his wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion endures from generation to generation."
Daniel,4,4,"I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and prospering in my palace."
Daniel,4,5,I saw a dream that made me afraid. As I lay in bed the fancies and the visions of my head alarmed me.
Daniel,4,6,"So I made a decree that all the wise men of Babylon should be brought before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream."
Daniel,4,7,"Then the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers came in, and I told them the dream, but they could not make known to me its interpretation."
Daniel,4,8,"At last Daniel came in before me--he who was named Belteshazzar after the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods--and I told him the dream, saying,"
Daniel,4,9,"""O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and that no mystery is too difficult for you, tell me the visions of my dream that I saw and their interpretation."
Daniel,4,10,"The visions of my head as I lay in bed were these: I saw, and behold, a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great."
Daniel,4,11,"The tree grew and became strong, and its top reached to heaven, and it was visible to the end of the whole earth."
Daniel,4,12,"Its leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all. The beasts of the field found shade under it, and the birds of the heavens lived in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it."
Daniel,4,13,"""I saw in the visions of my head as I lay in bed, and behold, a watcher, a holy one, came down from heaven."
Daniel,4,14,"He proclaimed aloud and said thus: 'Chop down the tree and lop off its branches, strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the beasts flee from under it and the birds from its branches."
Daniel,4,15,"But leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, amid the tender grass of the field. Let him be wet with the dew of heaven. Let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth."
Daniel,4,16,"Let his mind be changed from a man's, and let a beast's mind be given to him; and let seven periods of time pass over him."
Daniel,4,17,"The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, the decision by the word of the holy ones, to the end that the living may know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will and sets over it the lowliest of men.'"
Daniel,4,18,"This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw. And you, O Belteshazzar, tell me the interpretation, because all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation, but you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in you."""
Daniel,4,19,"Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was dismayed for a while, and his thoughts alarmed him. The king answered and said, ""Belteshazzar, let not the dream or the interpretation alarm you."" Belteshazzar answered and said, ""My lord, may the dream be for those who hate you and its interpretation for your enemies!"
Daniel,4,20,"The tree you saw, which grew and became strong, so that its top reached to heaven, and it was visible to the end of the whole earth,"
Daniel,4,21,"whose leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant, and in which was food for all, under which beasts of the field found shade, and in whose branches the birds of the heavens lived--"
Daniel,4,22,"it is you, O king, who have grown and become strong. Your greatness has grown and reaches to heaven, and your dominion to the ends of the earth."
Daniel,4,23,"And because the king saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, 'Chop down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field, and let him be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven periods of time pass over him,'"
Daniel,4,24,"this is the interpretation, O king: It is a decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king,"
Daniel,4,25,"that you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. You shall be made to eat grass like an ox, and you shall be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven periods of time shall pass over you, till you know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will."
Daniel,4,26,"And as it was commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree, your kingdom shall be confirmed for you from the time that you know that Heaven rules."
Daniel,4,27,"Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you: break off your sins by practicing righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the oppressed, that there may perhaps be a lengthening of your prosperity."""
Daniel,4,28,All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar.
Daniel,4,29,"At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon,"
Daniel,4,30,"and the king answered and said, ""Is not this great Babylon, which I have built by my mighty power as a royal residence and for the glory of my majesty?"""
Daniel,4,31,"While the words were still in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, ""O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom has departed from you,"
Daniel,4,32,"and you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. And you shall be made to eat grass like an ox, and seven periods of time shall pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will."""
Daniel,4,33,"Immediately the word was fulfilled against Nebuchadnezzar. He was driven from among men and ate grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hair grew as long as eagles' feathers, and his nails were like birds' claws."
Daniel,4,34,"At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored him who lives forever, for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom endures from generation to generation;"
Daniel,4,35,"all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, and he does according to his will among the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand or say to him, ""What have you done?"""
Daniel,4,36,"At the same time my reason returned to me, and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and splendor returned to me. My counselors and my lords sought me, and I was established in my kingdom, and still more greatness was added to me."
Daniel,4,37,"Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, for all his works are right and his ways are just; and those who walk in pride he is able to humble."
Daniel,5,1,King Belshazzar made a great feast for a thousand of his lords and drank wine in front of the thousand.
Daniel,5,2,"Belshazzar, when he tasted the wine, commanded that the vessels of gold and of silver that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple in Jerusalem be brought, that the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines might drink from them."
Daniel,5,3,"Then they brought in the golden vessels that had been taken out of the temple, the house of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines drank from them."
Daniel,5,4,"They drank wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone."
Daniel,5,5,"Immediately the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace, opposite the lampstand. And the king saw the hand as it wrote."
Daniel,5,6,"Then the king's color changed, and his thoughts alarmed him; his limbs gave way, and his knees knocked together."
Daniel,5,7,"The king called loudly to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers. The king declared to the wise men of Babylon, ""Whoever reads this writing, and shows me its interpretation, shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold around his neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom."""
Daniel,5,8,"Then all the king's wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or make known to the king the interpretation."
Daniel,5,9,"Then King Belshazzar was greatly alarmed, and his color changed, and his lords were perplexed."
Daniel,5,10,"The queen, because of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banqueting hall, and the queen declared, ""O king, live forever! Let not your thoughts alarm you or your color change."
Daniel,5,11,"There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. In the days of your father, light and understanding and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods were found in him, and King Nebuchadnezzar, your father--your father the king--made him chief of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and astrologers,"
Daniel,5,12,"because an excellent spirit, knowledge, and understanding to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve problems were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation."""
Daniel,5,13,"Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king answered and said to Daniel, ""You are that Daniel, one of the exiles of Judah, whom the king my father brought from Judah."
Daniel,5,14,"I have heard of you that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you."
Daniel,5,15,"Now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me to read this writing and make known to me its interpretation, but they could not show the interpretation of the matter."
Daniel,5,16,"But I have heard that you can give interpretations and solve problems. Now if you can read the writing and make known to me its interpretation, you shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold around your neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom."""
Daniel,5,17,"Then Daniel answered and said before the king, ""Let your gifts be for yourself, and give your rewards to another. Nevertheless, I will read the writing to the king and make known to him the interpretation."
Daniel,5,18,"O king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father kingship and greatness and glory and majesty."
Daniel,5,19,"And because of the greatness that he gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him. Whom he would, he killed, and whom he would, he kept alive; whom he would, he raised up, and whom he would, he humbled."
Daniel,5,20,"But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was brought down from his kingly throne, and his glory was taken from him."
Daniel,5,21,"He was driven from among the children of mankind, and his mind was made like that of a beast, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. He was fed grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until he knew that the Most High God rules the kingdom of mankind and sets over it whom he will."
Daniel,5,22,"And you his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this,"
Daniel,5,23,"but you have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven. And the vessels of his house have been brought in before you, and you and your lords, your wives, and your concubines have drunk wine from them. And you have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see or hear or know, but the God in whose hand is your breath, and whose are all your ways, you have not honored."
Daniel,5,24,"""Then from his presence the hand was sent, and this writing was inscribed."
Daniel,5,25,"And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, and PARSIN."
Daniel,5,26,"This is the interpretation of the matter: MENE, God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end;"
Daniel,5,27,"TEKEL, you have been weighed in the balances and found wanting;"
Daniel,5,28,"PERES, your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians."""
Daniel,5,29,"Then Belshazzar gave the command, and Daniel was clothed with purple, a chain of gold was put around his neck, and a proclamation was made about him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom."
Daniel,5,30,That very night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was killed.
Daniel,5,31,"And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old."
Daniel,6,1,"It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom 120 satraps, to be throughout the whole kingdom;"
Daniel,6,2,"and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one, to whom these satraps should give account, so that the king might suffer no loss."
Daniel,6,3,"Then this Daniel became distinguished above all the other presidents and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him. And the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom."
Daniel,6,4,"Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find a ground for complaint against Daniel with regard to the kingdom, but they could find no ground for complaint or any fault, because he was faithful, and no error or fault was found in him."
Daniel,6,5,"Then these men said, ""We shall not find any ground for complaint against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God."""
Daniel,6,6,"Then these presidents and satraps came by agreement to the king and said to him, ""O King Darius, live forever!"
Daniel,6,7,"All the presidents of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the counselors and the governors are agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an injunction, that whoever makes petition to any god or man for thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions."
Daniel,6,8,"Now, O king, establish the injunction and sign the document, so that it cannot be changed, according to the law of the Medes and the Persians, which cannot be revoked."""
Daniel,6,9,Therefore King Darius signed the document and injunction.
Daniel,6,10,"When Daniel knew that the document had been signed, he went to his house where he had windows in his upper chamber open toward Jerusalem. He got down on his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously."
Daniel,6,11,Then these men came by agreement and found Daniel making petition and plea before his God.
Daniel,6,12,"Then they came near and said before the king, concerning the injunction, ""O king! Did you not sign an injunction, that anyone who makes petition to any god or man within thirty days except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?"" The king answered and said, ""The thing stands fast, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be revoked."""
Daniel,6,13,"Then they answered and said before the king, ""Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or the injunction you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day."""
Daniel,6,14,"Then the king, when he heard these words, was much distressed and set his mind to deliver Daniel. And he labored till the sun went down to rescue him."
Daniel,6,15,"Then these men came by agreement to the king and said to the king, ""Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no injunction or ordinance that the king establishes can be changed."""
Daniel,6,16,"Then the king commanded, and Daniel was brought and cast into the den of lions. The king declared to Daniel, ""May your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you!"""
Daniel,6,17,"And a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords, that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel."
Daniel,6,18,"Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; no diversions were brought to him, and sleep fled from him."
Daniel,6,19,"Then, at break of day, the king arose and went in haste to the den of lions."
Daniel,6,20,"As he came near to the den where Daniel was, he cried out in a tone of anguish. The king declared to Daniel, ""O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?"""
Daniel,6,21,"Then Daniel said to the king, ""O king, live forever!"
Daniel,6,22,"My God sent his angel and shut the lions' mouths, and they have not harmed me, because I was found blameless before him; and also before you, O king, I have done no harm."""
Daniel,6,23,"Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God."
Daniel,6,24,"And the king commanded, and those men who had maliciously accused Daniel were brought and cast into the den of lions--they, their children, and their wives. And before they reached the bottom of the den, the lions overpowered them and broke all their bones in pieces."
Daniel,6,25,"Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth: ""Peace be multiplied to you."
Daniel,6,26,"I make a decree, that in all my royal dominion people are to tremble and fear before the God of Daniel, for he is the living God, enduring forever; his kingdom shall never be destroyed, and his dominion shall be to the end."
Daniel,6,27,"He delivers and rescues; he works signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, he who has saved Daniel from the power of the lions."""
Daniel,6,28,So this Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
Daniel,7,1,"In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head as he lay in his bed. Then he wrote down the dream and told the sum of the matter."
Daniel,7,2,"Daniel declared, ""I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea."
Daniel,7,3,"And four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another."
Daniel,7,4,"The first was like a lion and had eagles' wings. Then as I looked its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man, and the mind of a man was given to it."
Daniel,7,5,"And behold, another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side. It had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, 'Arise, devour much flesh.'"
Daniel,7,6,"After this I looked, and behold, another, like a leopard, with four wings of a bird on its back. And the beast had four heads, and dominion was given to it."
Daniel,7,7,"After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns."
Daniel,7,8,"I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things."
Daniel,7,9,"As I looked, thrones were placed, and the Ancient of days took his seat; his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames; its wheels were burning fire."
Daniel,7,10,"A stream of fire issued and came out from before him; a thousand thousands served him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the court sat in judgment, and the books were opened."
Daniel,7,11,"I looked then because of the sound of the great words that the horn was speaking. And as I looked, the beast was killed, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire."
Daniel,7,12,"As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time."
Daniel,7,13,"I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him."
Daniel,7,14,"And to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed."
Daniel,7,15,"""As for me, Daniel, my spirit within me was anxious, and the visions of my head alarmed me."
Daniel,7,16,I approached one of those who stood there and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of the things.
Daniel,7,17,'These four great beasts are four kings who shall arise out of the earth.
Daniel,7,18,"But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, forever and ever.'"
Daniel,7,19,"""Then I desired to know the truth about the fourth beast, which was different from all the rest, exceedingly terrifying, with its teeth of iron and claws of bronze, and which devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet,"
Daniel,7,20,"and about the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn that came up and before which three of them fell, the horn that had eyes and a mouth that spoke great things, and that seemed greater than its companions."
Daniel,7,21,"As I looked, this horn made war with the saints and prevailed over them,"
Daniel,7,22,"until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High, and the time came when the saints possessed the kingdom."
Daniel,7,23,"""Thus he said: 'As for the fourth beast, there shall be a fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be different from all the kingdoms, and it shall devour the whole earth, and trample it down, and break it to pieces."
Daniel,7,24,"As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise, and another shall arise after them; he shall be different from the former ones, and shall put down three kings."
Daniel,7,25,"He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time."
Daniel,7,26,"But the court shall sit in judgment, and his dominion shall be taken away, to be consumed and destroyed to the end."
Daniel,7,27,"And the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; their kingdom shall be an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey them.'"
Daniel,7,28,"""Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts greatly alarmed me, and my color changed, but I kept the matter in my heart."""
Daniel,8,1,"In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first."
Daniel,8,2,"And I saw in the vision; and when I saw, I was in Susa the capital, which is in the province of Elam. And I saw in the vision, and I was at the Ulai canal."
Daniel,8,3,"I raised my eyes and saw, and behold, a ram standing on the bank of the canal. It had two horns, and both horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last."
Daniel,8,4,"I saw the ram charging westward and northward and southward. No beast could stand before him, and there was no one who could rescue from his power. He did as he pleased and became great."
Daniel,8,5,"As I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west across the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground. And the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes."
Daniel,8,6,"He came to the ram with the two horns, which I had seen standing on the bank of the canal, and he ran at him in his powerful wrath."
Daniel,8,7,"I saw him come close to the ram, and he was enraged against him and struck the ram and broke his two horns. And the ram had no power to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground and trampled on him. And there was no one who could rescue the ram from his power."
Daniel,8,8,"Then the goat became exceedingly great, but when he was strong, the great horn was broken, and instead of it there came up four conspicuous horns toward the four winds of heaven."
Daniel,8,9,"Out of one of them came a little horn, which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the glorious land."
Daniel,8,10,"It grew great, even to the host of heaven. And some of the host and some of the stars it threw down to the ground and trampled on them."
Daniel,8,11,"It became great, even as great as the Prince of the host. And the regular burnt offering was taken away from him, and the place of his sanctuary was overthrown."
Daniel,8,12,"And a host will be given over to it together with the regular burnt offering because of transgression, and it will throw truth to the ground, and it will act and prosper."
Daniel,8,13,"Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to the one who spoke, ""For how long is the vision concerning the regular burnt offering, the transgression that makes desolate, and the giving over of the sanctuary and host to be trampled underfoot?"""
Daniel,8,14,"And he said to me, ""For 2,300 evenings and mornings. Then the sanctuary shall be restored to its rightful state."""
Daniel,8,15,"When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it. And behold, there stood before me one having the appearance of a man."
Daniel,8,16,"And I heard a man's voice between the banks of the Ulai, and it called, ""Gabriel, make this man understand the vision."""
Daniel,8,17,"So he came near where I stood. And when he came, I was frightened and fell on my face. But he said to me, ""Understand, O son of man, that the vision is for the time of the end."""
Daniel,8,18,"And when he had spoken to me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground. But he touched me and made me stand up."
Daniel,8,19,"He said, ""Behold, I will make known to you what shall be at the latter end of the indignation, for it refers to the appointed time of the end."
Daniel,8,20,"As for the ram that you saw with the two horns, these are the kings of Media and Persia."
Daniel,8,21,And the goat is the king of Greece. And the great horn between his eyes is the first king.
Daniel,8,22,"As for the horn that was broken, in place of which four others arose, four kingdoms shall arise from his nation, but not with his power."
Daniel,8,23,"And at the latter end of their kingdom, when the transgressors have reached their limit, a king of bold face, one who understands riddles, shall arise."
Daniel,8,24,"His power shall be great--but not by his own power; and he shall cause fearful destruction and shall succeed in what he does, and destroy mighty men and the people who are the saints."
Daniel,8,25,"By his cunning he shall make deceit prosper under his hand, and in his own mind he shall become great. Without warning he shall destroy many. And he shall even rise up against the Prince of princes, and he shall be broken--but by no human hand."
Daniel,8,26,"The vision of the evenings and the mornings that has been told is true, but seal up the vision, for it refers to many days from now."""
Daniel,8,27,"And I, Daniel, was overcome and lay sick for some days. Then I rose and went about the king's business, but I was appalled by the vision and did not understand it."
Daniel,9,1,"In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, by descent a Mede, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans--"
Daniel,9,2,"in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, perceived in the books the number of years that, according to the word of the LORD to Jeremiah the prophet, must pass before the end of the desolations of Jerusalem, namely, seventy years."
Daniel,9,3,"Then I turned my face to the Lord God, seeking him by prayer and pleas for mercy with fasting and sackcloth and ashes."
Daniel,9,4,"I prayed to the LORD my God and made confession, saying, ""O Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments,"
Daniel,9,5,"we have sinned and done wrong and acted wickedly and rebelled, turning aside from your commandments and rules."
Daniel,9,6,"We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land."
Daniel,9,7,"To you, O Lord, belongs righteousness, but to us open shame, as at this day, to the men of Judah, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, those who are near and those who are far away, in all the lands to which you have driven them, because of the treachery that they have committed against you."
Daniel,9,8,"To us, O Lord, belongs open shame, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against you."
Daniel,9,9,"To the Lord our God belong mercy and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against him"
Daniel,9,10,"and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God by walking in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets."
Daniel,9,11,"All Israel has transgressed your law and turned aside, refusing to obey your voice. And the curse and oath that are written in the Law of Moses the servant of God have been poured out upon us, because we have sinned against him."
