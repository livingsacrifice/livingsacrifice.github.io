Isaiah,36,12,"But the Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, who will eat and drink their own waste with you?”"
Isaiah,36,13,"Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out with a loud voice in Hebrew, and said, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!"
Isaiah,36,14,"Thus says the king: ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you;"

Isaiah,36,20,"Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their countries from my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem from my hand?’”"
Isaiah,36,21,"But they held their peace and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment was, “Do not answer him.”"
Isaiah,36,22,"Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of the Rabshakeh."
Isaiah,37,1,"And so it was, when King Hezekiah heard it, that he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD."
Isaiah,37,2,"Then he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz."
Isaiah,37,3,"And they said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah: ‘This day is a day of trouble and rebuke and blasphemy; for the children have come to birth, but there is no strength to bring them forth."
Isaiah,37,4,"It may be that the LORD your God will hear the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God, and will rebuke the words which the LORD your God has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.’”"
Isaiah,37,5,So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
Isaiah,37,6,"And Isaiah said to them, “Thus you shall say to your master, ‘Thus says the LORD: “Do not be afraid of the words which you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me."
Isaiah,37,7,"Surely I will send a spirit upon him, and he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.”’”"
Isaiah,37,8,"Then the Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, for he heard that he had departed from Lachish."
Isaiah,37,9,"And the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “He has come out to make war with you.” So when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,"
Isaiah,37,10,"“Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: ‘Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, “Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”"
Isaiah,37,11,Look! You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by utterly destroying them; and shall you be delivered?
Isaiah,37,12,"Have the gods of the nations delivered those whom my fathers have destroyed, Gozan and Haran and Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar?"
Isaiah,37,13,"Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?’”"
Isaiah,37,14,"And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD."
Isaiah,37,15,"Then Hezekiah prayed to the LORD, saying:"
Isaiah,37,16,"“O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, the One who dwells between the cherubim, You are God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth."
Isaiah,37,17,"Incline Your ear, O LORD, and hear; open Your eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to reproach the living God."
Isaiah,37,18,"Truly, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their lands,"
Isaiah,37,19,"and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were not gods, but the work of men’s hands—wood and stone. Therefore they destroyed them."
Isaiah,37,20,"Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You are the LORD, You alone.”"
Isaiah,37,21,"Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says the LORD God of Israel, ‘Because you have prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,"
Isaiah,37,22,"this is the word which the LORD has spoken concerning him: “The virgin, the daughter of Zion, Has despised you, laughed you to scorn; The daughter of Jerusalem Has shaken her head behind your back!"
Isaiah,37,23,"“Whom have you reproached and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice, And lifted up your eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel."
Isaiah,37,24,"By your servants you have reproached the Lord, And said, ‘By the multitude of my chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains, To the limits of Lebanon; I will cut down its tall cedars And its choice cypress trees; I will enter its farthest height, To its fruitful forest."
Isaiah,37,25,"I have dug and drunk water, And with the soles of my feet I have dried up All the brooks of defense.’"
Isaiah,37,26,"“Did you not hear long ago How I made it, From ancient times that I formed it? Now I have brought it to pass, That you should be For crushing fortified cities into heaps of ruins."
Isaiah,37,27,"Therefore their inhabitants had little power; They were dismayed and confounded; They were as the grass of the field And the green herb, As the grass on the housetops And grain blighted before it is grown."
Isaiah,37,28,"“But I know your dwelling place, Your going out and your coming in, And your rage against Me."
Isaiah,37,29,"Because your rage against Me and your tumult Have come up to My ears, Therefore I will put My hook in your nose And My bridle in your lips, And I will turn you back By the way which you came.”’"
Isaiah,37,30,"“This shall be a sign to you: You shall eat this year such as grows of itself, And the second year what springs from the same; Also in the third year sow and reap, Plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them."
Isaiah,37,31,"And the remnant who have escaped of the house of Judah Shall again take root downward, And bear fruit upward."
Isaiah,37,32,"For out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant, And those who escape from Mount Zion. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this."
Isaiah,37,33,"“Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria: ‘He shall not come into this city, Nor shoot an arrow there, Nor come before it with shield, Nor build a siege mound against it."
Isaiah,37,34,"By the way that he came, By the same shall he return; And he shall not come into this city,’ Says the LORD."
Isaiah,37,35,"‘For I will defend this city, to save it For My own sake and for My servant David’s sake.’”"
Isaiah,37,36,"Then the angel of the LORD went out, and killed in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred and eighty-five thousand; and when people arose early in the morning, there were the corpses—all dead."
Isaiah,37,37,"So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and went away, returned home, and remained at Nineveh."
Isaiah,37,38,"Now it came to pass, as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. Then Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place."
Isaiah,38,1,"In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death. And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, went to him and said to him, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Set your house in order, for you shall die and not live.’”"
Isaiah,38,2,"Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to the LORD,"
Isaiah,38,3,"and said, “Remember now, O LORD, I pray, how I have walked before You in truth and with a loyal heart, and have done what is good in Your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly."
Isaiah,38,4,"And the word of the LORD came to Isaiah, saying,"
Isaiah,38,5,"“Go and tell Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father: “I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; surely I will add to your days fifteen years."
Isaiah,38,6,"I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city.”’"
Isaiah,38,7,"And this is the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing which He has spoken:"
Isaiah,38,8,"“Behold, I will bring the shadow on the sundial, which has gone down with the sun on the sundial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward.” So the sun returned ten degrees on the dial by which it had gone down."
Isaiah,38,9,"This is the writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness:"
Isaiah,38,10,"I said, “In the prime of my life I shall go to the gates of Sheol; I am deprived of the remainder of my years.”"
Isaiah,38,11,"I said, “I shall not see YAH, The LORD in the land of the living; I shall observe man no more among the inhabitants of the world."

Isaiah,38,13,"I have considered until morning— Like a lion, So He breaks all my bones; From day until night You make an end of me."
Isaiah,38,14,"Like a crane or a swallow, so I chattered; I mourned like a dove; My eyes fail from looking upward. O LORD, I am oppressed; Undertake for me!"
Isaiah,38,15,"“What shall I say? He has both spoken to me, And He Himself has done it. I shall walk carefully all my years In the bitterness of my soul."
Isaiah,38,16,"O Lord, by these things men live; And in all these things is the life of my spirit; So You will restore me and make me live."
Isaiah,38,17,"Indeed it was for my own peace That I had great bitterness; But You have lovingly delivered my soul from the pit of corruption, For You have cast all my sins behind Your back."
Isaiah,38,18,"For Sheol cannot thank You, Death cannot praise You; Those who go down to the pit cannot hope for Your truth."
Isaiah,38,19,"The living, the living man, he shall praise You, As I do this day; The father shall make known Your truth to the children."
Isaiah,38,20,"“The LORD was ready to save me; Therefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments All the days of our life, in the house of the LORD.”"
Isaiah,38,21,"Now Isaiah had said, “Let them take a lump of figs, and apply it as a poultice on the boil, and he shall recover.”"
Isaiah,38,22,"And Hezekiah had said, “What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?”"
Isaiah,39,1,"At that time Merodach-Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that he had been sick and had recovered."
Isaiah,39,2,"And Hezekiah was pleased with them, and showed them the house of his treasures—the silver and gold, the spices and precious ointment, and all his armory—all that was found among his treasures. There was nothing in his house or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them."
Isaiah,39,3,"Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah, and said to him, “What did these men say, and from where did they come to you?” So Hezekiah said, “They came to me from a far country, from Babylon.”"
Isaiah,39,4,"And he said, “What have they seen in your house?” So Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.”"
Isaiah,39,5,"Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:"
Isaiah,39,6,"‘Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and what your fathers have accumulated until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left,’ says the LORD."
Isaiah,39,7,"‘And they shall take away some of your sons who will descend from you, whom you will beget; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’”"

Isaiah,40,1,"“Comfort, yes, comfort My people!” Says your God."

Jeremiah,10,2,"Thus says the LORD: “Do not learn the way of the Gentiles; Do not be dismayed at the signs of heaven, For the Gentiles are dismayed at them."
Jeremiah,10,3,"For the customs of the peoples are futile; For one cuts a tree from the forest, The work of the hands of the workman, with the ax."
Jeremiah,10,4,They decorate it with silver and gold; They fasten it with nails and hammers So that it will not topple.
Jeremiah,10,5,"They are upright, like a palm tree, And they cannot speak; They must be carried, Because they cannot go by themselves. Do not be afraid of them, For they cannot do evil, Nor can they do any good.”"

Jeremiah,20,10,"For I heard many mocking: “Fear on every side!” “Report,” they say, “and we will report it!” All my acquaintances watched for my stumbling, saying, “Perhaps he can be induced; Then we will prevail against him, And we will take our revenge on him.”"
Jeremiah,20,11,"But the LORD is with me as a mighty, awesome One. Therefore my persecutors will stumble, and will not prevail. They will be greatly ashamed, for they will not prosper. Their everlasting confusion will never be forgotten."
Jeremiah,20,12,"But, O LORD of hosts, You who test the righteous, And see the mind and heart, Let me see Your vengeance on them; For I have pleaded my cause before You."
Jeremiah,20,13,Sing to the LORD! Praise the LORD! For He has delivered the life of the poor From the hand of evildoers.
Jeremiah,20,14,Cursed be the day in which I was born! Let the day not be blessed in which my mother bore me!
Jeremiah,20,15,"Let the man be cursed Who brought news to my father, saying, “A male child has been born to you!” Making him very glad."
Jeremiah,20,16,"And let that man be like the cities Which the LORD overthrew, and did not relent; Let him hear the cry in the morning And the shouting at noon,"
Jeremiah,20,17,"Because he did not kill me from the womb, That my mother might have been my grave, And her womb always enlarged with me."
Jeremiah,20,18,"Why did I come forth from the womb to see labor and sorrow, That my days should be consumed with shame?"
Jeremiah,21,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, saying,"
Jeremiah,21,2,"“Please inquire of the LORD for us, for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon makes war against us. Perhaps the LORD will deal with us according to all His wonderful works, that the king may go away from us.”"
Jeremiah,21,3,"Then Jeremiah said to them, “Thus you shall say to Zedekiah,"
Jeremiah,21,4,"‘Thus says the LORD God of Israel: “Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which you fight against the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who besiege you outside the walls; and I will assemble them in the midst of this city."
Jeremiah,21,5,"I Myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger and fury and great wrath."
Jeremiah,21,6,"I will strike the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast; they shall die of a great pestilence."
Jeremiah,21,7,"And afterward,” says the LORD, “I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, his servants and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence and the sword and the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life; and he shall strike them with the edge of the sword. He shall not spare them, or have pity or mercy.”’"
Jeremiah,21,8,"“Now you shall say to this people, ‘Thus says the LORD: “Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death."
Jeremiah,21,9,"He who remains in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence; but he who goes out and defects to the Chaldeans who besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be as a prize to him."
Jeremiah,21,10,"For I have set My face against this city for adversity and not for good,” says the LORD. “It shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.”’"
Jeremiah,21,11,"“And concerning the house of the king of Judah, say, ‘Hear the word of the LORD,"
Jeremiah,21,12,"O house of David! Thus says the LORD: “Execute judgment in the morning; And deliver him who is plundered Out of the hand of the oppressor, Lest My fury go forth like fire And burn so that no one can quench it, Because of the evil of your doings."
Jeremiah,21,13,"“Behold, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley, And rock of the plain,” says the LORD, “Who say, ‘Who shall come down against us? Or who shall enter our dwellings?’"
Jeremiah,21,14,"But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings,” says the LORD; “I will kindle a fire in its forest, And it shall devour all things around it.”’”"
Jeremiah,22,1,"Thus says the LORD: “Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and there speak this word,"
Jeremiah,22,2,"and say, ‘Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, you who sit on the throne of David, you and your servants and your people who enter these gates!"
Jeremiah,22,3,"Thus says the LORD: “Execute judgment and righteousness, and deliver the plundered out of the hand of the oppressor. Do no wrong and do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, or the widow, nor shed innocent blood in this place."
Jeremiah,22,4,"For if you indeed do this thing, then shall enter the gates of this house, riding on horses and in chariots, accompanied by servants and people, kings who sit on the throne of David."
Jeremiah,22,5,"But if you will not hear these words, I swear by Myself,” says the LORD, “that this house shall become a desolation.”’”"
Jeremiah,22,6,"For thus says the LORD to the house of the king of Judah: “You are Gilead to Me, The head of Lebanon; Yet I surely will make you a wilderness, Cities which are not inhabited."
Jeremiah,22,7,"I will prepare destroyers against you, Everyone with his weapons; They shall cut down your choice cedars And cast them into the fire."
Jeremiah,22,8,"And many nations will pass by this city; and everyone will say to his neighbor, ‘Why has the LORD done so to this great city?’"
Jeremiah,22,9,"Then they will answer, ‘Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God, and worshiped other gods and served them.’”"
Jeremiah,22,10,"Weep not for the dead, nor bemoan him; Weep bitterly for him who goes away, For he shall return no more, Nor see his native country."
Jeremiah,22,11,"For thus says the LORD concerning Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, who went from this place: “He shall not return here anymore,"
Jeremiah,22,12,"but he shall die in the place where they have led him captive, and shall see this land no more."
Jeremiah,22,13,"“Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness And his chambers by injustice, Who uses his neighbor’s service without wages And gives him nothing for his work,"
Jeremiah,22,14,"Who says, ‘I will build myself a wide house with spacious chambers, And cut out windows for it, Paneling it with cedar And painting it with vermilion.’"
Jeremiah,22,15,"“Shall you reign because you enclose yourself in cedar? Did not your father eat and drink, And do justice and righteousness? Then it was well with him."
Jeremiah,22,16,He judged the cause of the poor and needy; Then it was well. Was not this knowing Me?” says the LORD.
Jeremiah,22,17,"“Yet your eyes and your heart are for nothing but your covetousness, For shedding innocent blood, And practicing oppression and violence.”"
Jeremiah,22,18,"Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: “They shall not lament for him, Saying, ‘Alas, my brother!’ or ‘Alas, my sister!’ They shall not lament for him, Saying, ‘Alas, master!’ or ‘Alas, his glory!’"
Jeremiah,22,19,"He shall be buried with the burial of a donkey, Dragged and cast out beyond the gates of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,22,20,"“Go up to Lebanon, and cry out, And lift up your voice in Bashan; Cry from Abarim, For all your lovers are destroyed."
Jeremiah,22,21,"I spoke to you in your prosperity, But you said, ‘I will not hear.’ This has been your manner from your youth, That you did not obey My voice."
Jeremiah,22,22,"The wind shall eat up all your rulers, And your lovers shall go into captivity; Surely then you will be ashamed and humiliated For all your wickedness."
Jeremiah,22,23,"O inhabitant of Lebanon, Making your nest in the cedars, How gracious will you be when pangs come upon you, Like the pain of a woman in labor?"
Jeremiah,22,24,"“As I live,” says the LORD, “though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were the signet on My right hand, yet I would pluck you off;"
Jeremiah,22,25,"and I will give you into the hand of those who seek your life, and into the hand of those whose face you fear—the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and the hand of the Chaldeans."
Jeremiah,22,26,"So I will cast you out, and your mother who bore you, into another country where you were not born; and there you shall die."
Jeremiah,22,27,"But to the land to which they desire to return, there they shall not return."
Jeremiah,22,28,"“Is this man Coniah a despised, broken idol— A vessel in which is no pleasure? Why are they cast out, he and his descendants, And cast into a land which they do not know?"
Jeremiah,22,29,"O earth, earth, earth, Hear the word of the LORD!"
Jeremiah,22,30,"Thus says the LORD: ‘Write this man down as childless, A man who shall not prosper in his days; For none of his descendants shall prosper, Sitting on the throne of David, And ruling anymore in Judah.’”"
Jeremiah,23,1,“Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of My pasture!” says the LORD.
Jeremiah,23,2,"Therefore thus says the LORD God of Israel against the shepherds who feed My people: “You have scattered My flock, driven them away, and not attended to them. Behold, I will attend to you for the evil of your doings,” says the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,3,"“But I will gather the remnant of My flock out of all countries where I have driven them, and bring them back to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase."
Jeremiah,23,4,"I will set up shepherds over them who will feed them; and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, nor shall they be lacking,” says the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,5,"“Behold, the days are coming,” says the LORD, “That I will raise to David a Branch of righteousness; A King shall reign and prosper, And execute judgment and righteousness in the earth."
Jeremiah,23,6,"In His days Judah will be saved, And Israel will dwell safely; Now this is His name by which He will be called: THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS."
Jeremiah,23,7,"“Therefore, behold, the days are coming,” says the LORD, “that they shall no longer say, ‘As the LORD lives who brought up the children of Israel from the land of Egypt,’"
Jeremiah,23,8,"but, ‘As the LORD lives who brought up and led the descendants of the house of Israel from the north country and from all the countries where I had driven them.’ And they shall dwell in their own land.”"
Jeremiah,23,9,"My heart within me is broken Because of the prophets; All my bones shake. I am like a drunken man, And like a man whom wine has overcome, Because of the LORD, And because of His holy words."
Jeremiah,23,10,"For the land is full of adulterers; For because of a curse the land mourns. The pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up. Their course of life is evil, And their might is not right."
Jeremiah,23,11,"“For both prophet and priest are profane; Yes, in My house I have found their wickedness,” says the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,12,"“Therefore their way shall be to them Like slippery ways; In the darkness they shall be driven on And fall in them; For I will bring disaster on them, The year of their punishment,” says the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,13,“And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria: They prophesied by Baal And caused My people Israel to err.
Jeremiah,23,14,"Also I have seen a horrible thing in the prophets of Jerusalem: They commit adultery and walk in lies; They also strengthen the hands of evildoers, So that no one turns back from his wickedness. All of them are like Sodom to Me, And her inhabitants like Gomorrah."
Jeremiah,23,15,"“Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets: ‘Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, And make them drink the water of gall; For from the prophets of Jerusalem Profaneness has gone out into all the land.’”"
Jeremiah,23,16,"Thus says the LORD of hosts: “Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. They make you worthless; They speak a vision of their own heart, Not from the mouth of the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,17,"They continually say to those who despise Me, ‘The LORD has said, “You shall have peace”’; And to everyone who walks according to the dictates of his own heart, they say, ‘No evil shall come upon you.’”"
Jeremiah,23,18,"For who has stood in the counsel of the LORD, And has perceived and heard His word? Who has marked His word and heard it?"
Jeremiah,23,19,"Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD has gone forth in fury— A violent whirlwind! It will fall violently on the head of the wicked."
Jeremiah,23,20,The anger of the LORD will not turn back Until He has executed and performed the thoughts of His heart. In the latter days you will understand it perfectly.
Jeremiah,23,21,"“I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran. I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied."
Jeremiah,23,22,"But if they had stood in My counsel, And had caused My people to hear My words, Then they would have turned them from their evil way And from the evil of their doings."
Jeremiah,23,23,"“Am I a God near at hand,” says the LORD, “And not a God afar off?"
Jeremiah,23,24,"Can anyone hide himself in secret places, So I shall not see him?” says the LORD; “Do I not fill heaven and earth?” says the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,25,"“I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in My name, saying, ‘I have dreamed, I have dreamed!’"
Jeremiah,23,26,"How long will this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies? Indeed they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart,"
Jeremiah,23,27,"who try to make My people forget My name by their dreams which everyone tells his neighbor, as their fathers forgot My name for Baal."
Jeremiah,23,28,"“The prophet who has a dream, let him tell a dream; And he who has My word, let him speak My word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat?” says the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,29,"“Is not My word like a fire?” says the LORD, “And like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?"
Jeremiah,23,30,"“Therefore behold, I am against the prophets,” says the LORD, “who steal My words every one from his neighbor."
Jeremiah,23,31,"Behold, I am against the prophets,” says the LORD, “who use their tongues and say, ‘He says.’"
Jeremiah,23,32,"Behold, I am against those who prophesy false dreams,” says the LORD, “and tell them, and cause My people to err by their lies and by their recklessness. Yet I did not send them or command them; therefore they shall not profit this people at all,” says the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,33,"“So when these people or the prophet or the priest ask you, saying, ‘What is the oracle of the LORD?’ you shall then say to them, ‘What oracle?’ I will even forsake you,” says the LORD."
Jeremiah,23,34,"“And as for the prophet and the priest and the people who say, ‘The oracle of the LORD!’ I will even punish that man and his house."
Jeremiah,23,35,"Thus every one of you shall say to his neighbor, and every one to his brother, ‘What has the LORD answered?’ and, ‘What has the LORD spoken?’"
Jeremiah,23,36,"And the oracle of the LORD you shall mention no more. For every man’s word will be his oracle, for you have perverted the words of the living God, the LORD of hosts, our God."
Jeremiah,23,37,"Thus you shall say to the prophet, ‘What has the LORD answered you?’ and, ‘What has the LORD spoken?’"
Jeremiah,23,38,"But since you say, ‘The oracle of the LORD!’ therefore thus says the LORD: ‘Because you say this word, “The oracle of the LORD!” and I have sent to you, saying, “Do not say, ‘The oracle of the LORD!’”"
Jeremiah,23,39,"therefore behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you and forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and will cast you out of My presence."
Jeremiah,23,40,"And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.’”"
Jeremiah,24,1,"The LORD showed me, and there were two baskets of figs set before the temple of the LORD, after Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah with the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon."
Jeremiah,24,2,"One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first ripe; and the other basket had very bad figs which could not be eaten, they were so bad."
Jeremiah,24,3,"Then the LORD said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” And I said, “Figs, the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad.”"
Jeremiah,24,4,"Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Jeremiah,24,5,"“Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: ‘Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge those who are carried away captive from Judah, whom I have sent out of this place for their own good, into the land of the Chaldeans."
Jeremiah,24,6,"For I will set My eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to this land; I will build them and not pull them down, and I will plant them and not pluck them up."
Jeremiah,24,7,"Then I will give them a heart to know Me, that I am the LORD; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God, for they shall return to Me with their whole heart."
Jeremiah,24,8,"‘And as the bad figs which cannot be eaten, they are so bad’—surely thus says the LORD—‘so will I give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, his princes, the residue of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and those who dwell in the land of Egypt."
Jeremiah,24,9,"I will deliver them to trouble into all the kingdoms of the earth, for their harm, to be a reproach and a byword, a taunt and a curse, in all places where I shall drive them."
Jeremiah,24,10,"And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence among them, till they are consumed from the land that I gave to them and their fathers.’”"
Jeremiah,25,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon),"
Jeremiah,25,2,"which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying:"
Jeremiah,25,3,"“From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even to this day, this is the twenty-third year in which the word of the LORD has come to me; and I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking, but you have not listened."
Jeremiah,25,4,"And the LORD has sent to you all His servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, but you have not listened nor inclined your ear to hear."
Jeremiah,25,5,"They said, ‘Repent now everyone of his evil way and his evil doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD has given to you and your fathers forever and ever."
Jeremiah,25,6,"Do not go after other gods to serve them and worship them, and do not provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands; and I will not harm you.’"
Jeremiah,25,7,"Yet you have not listened to Me,” says the LORD, “that you might provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt."
Jeremiah,25,8,"“Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: ‘Because you have not heard My words,"
Jeremiah,25,9,"behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,’ says the LORD, ‘and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant, and will bring them against this land, against its inhabitants, and against these nations all around, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, a hissing, and perpetual desolations."
Jeremiah,25,10,"Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp."
Jeremiah,25,11,"And this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment, and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years."
Jeremiah,25,12,"‘Then it will come to pass, when seventy years are completed, that I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans, for their iniquity,’ says the LORD; ‘and I will make it a perpetual desolation."
Jeremiah,25,13,"So I will bring on that land all My words which I have pronounced against it, all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied concerning all the nations."
Jeremiah,25,14,(For many nations and great kings shall be served by them also; and I will repay them according to their deeds and according to the works of their own hands.)’”
Jeremiah,25,15,"For thus says the LORD God of Israel to me: “Take this wine cup of fury from My hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it."
Jeremiah,25,16,And they will drink and stagger and go mad because of the sword that I will send among them.”
Jeremiah,25,17,"Then I took the cup from the LORD’s hand, and made all the nations drink, to whom the LORD had sent me:"
Jeremiah,25,18,"Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, its kings and its princes, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day;"
Jeremiah,25,19,"Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his princes, and all his people;"
Jeremiah,25,20,"all the mixed multitude, all the kings of the land of Uz, all the kings of the land of the Philistines (namely, Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod);"
Jeremiah,25,21,"Edom, Moab, and the people of Ammon;"
Jeremiah,25,22,"all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the coastlands which are across the sea;"
Jeremiah,25,23,"Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who are in the farthest corners;"
Jeremiah,25,24,all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the mixed multitude who dwell in the desert;
Jeremiah,25,25,"all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes;"
Jeremiah,25,26,"all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world which are on the face of the earth. Also the king of Sheshach shall drink after them."
Jeremiah,25,27,"“Therefore you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: “Drink, be drunk, and vomit! Fall and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.”’"
Jeremiah,25,28,"And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts: “You shall certainly drink!"
Jeremiah,25,29,"For behold, I begin to bring calamity on the city which is called by My name, and should you be utterly unpunished? You shall not be unpunished, for I will call for a sword on all the inhabitants of the earth,” says the LORD of hosts.’"
Jeremiah,25,30,"“Therefore prophesy against them all these words, and say to them: ‘The LORD will roar from on high, And utter His voice from His holy habitation; He will roar mightily against His fold. He will give a shout, as those who tread the grapes, Against all the inhabitants of the earth."
Jeremiah,25,31,"A noise will come to the ends of the earth— For the LORD has a controversy with the nations; He will plead His case with all flesh. He will give those who are wicked to the sword,’ says the LORD.”"
Jeremiah,25,32,"Thus says the LORD of hosts: “Behold, disaster shall go forth From nation to nation, And a great whirlwind shall be raised up From the farthest parts of the earth."
Jeremiah,25,33,"And at that day the slain of the LORD shall be from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth. They shall not be lamented, or gathered, or buried; they shall become refuse on the ground."
Jeremiah,25,34,"“Wail, shepherds, and cry! Roll about in the ashes, You leaders of the flock! For the days of your slaughter and your dispersions are fulfilled; You shall fall like a precious vessel."
Jeremiah,25,35,"And the shepherds will have no way to flee, Nor the leaders of the flock to escape."
Jeremiah,25,36,"A voice of the cry of the shepherds, And a wailing of the leaders to the flock will be heard. For the LORD has plundered their pasture,"
Jeremiah,25,37,And the peaceful dwellings are cut down Because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
Jeremiah,25,38,"He has left His lair like the lion; For their land is desolate Because of the fierceness of the Oppressor, And because of His fierce anger.”"
Jeremiah,26,1,"In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from the LORD, saying,"
Jeremiah,26,2,"“Thus says the LORD: ‘Stand in the court of the LORD’s house, and speak to all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD’s house, all the words that I command you to speak to them. Do not diminish a word."
Jeremiah,26,3,"Perhaps everyone will listen and turn from his evil way, that I may relent concerning the calamity which I purpose to bring on them because of the evil of their doings.’"
Jeremiah,26,4,"And you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD: “If you will not listen to Me, to walk in My law which I have set before you,"
Jeremiah,26,5,"to heed the words of My servants the prophets whom I sent to you, both rising up early and sending them (but you have not heeded),"
Jeremiah,26,6,"then I will make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.”’”"
Jeremiah,26,7,So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.
Jeremiah,26,8,"Now it happened, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak to all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him, saying, “You will surely die!"
Jeremiah,26,9,"Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, ‘This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without an inhabitant’?” And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD."
Jeremiah,26,10,"When the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king’s house to the house of the LORD and sat down in the entry of the New Gate of the LORD’s house."
Jeremiah,26,11,"And the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and all the people, saying, “This man deserves to die! For he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears.”"
Jeremiah,26,12,"Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and all the people, saying: “The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city with all the words that you have heard."
Jeremiah,26,13,"Now therefore, amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; then the LORD will relent concerning the doom that He has pronounced against you."
Jeremiah,26,14,"As for me, here I am, in your hand; do with me as seems good and proper to you."
Jeremiah,26,15,"But know for certain that if you put me to death, you will surely bring innocent blood on yourselves, on this city, and on its inhabitants; for truly the LORD has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing.”"
Jeremiah,26,16,"So the princes and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, “This man does not deserve to die. For he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.”"
Jeremiah,26,17,"Then certain of the elders of the land rose up and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying:"
Jeremiah,26,18,"“Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts: “Zion shall be plowed like a field, Jerusalem shall become heaps of ruins, And the mountain of the temple Like the bare hills of the forest.”’"
Jeremiah,26,19,Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah ever put him to death? Did he not fear the LORD and seek the LORD’s favor? And the LORD relented concerning the doom which He had pronounced against them. But we are doing great evil against ourselves.”
Jeremiah,26,20,"Now there was also a man who prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath Jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah."
Jeremiah,26,21,"And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid and fled, and went to Egypt."
Jeremiah,26,22,"Then Jehoiakim the king sent men to Egypt: Elnathan the son of Achbor, and other men who went with him to Egypt."
Jeremiah,26,23,"And they brought Urijah from Egypt and brought him to Jehoiakim the king, who killed him with the sword and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people."
Jeremiah,26,24,"Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death."
Jeremiah,27,1,"In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,"
Jeremiah,27,2,"“Thus says the LORD to me: ‘Make for yourselves bonds and yokes, and put them on your neck,"
Jeremiah,27,3,"and send them to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the Ammonites, the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah."
Jeremiah,27,4,"And command them to say to their masters, “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel—thus you shall say to your masters:"
Jeremiah,27,5,"‘I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are on the ground, by My great power and by My outstretched arm, and have given it to whom it seemed proper to Me."
Jeremiah,27,6,"And now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant; and the beasts of the field I have also given him to serve him."
Jeremiah,27,7,"So all nations shall serve him and his son and his son’s son, until the time of his land comes; and then many nations and great kings shall make him serve them."
Jeremiah,27,8,"And it shall be, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and which will not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation I will punish,’ says the LORD, ‘with the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand."
Jeremiah,27,9,"Therefore do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your soothsayers, or your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, “You shall not serve the king of Babylon.”"
Jeremiah,27,10,"For they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land; and I will drive you out, and you will perish."
Jeremiah,27,11,"But the nations that bring their necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will let them remain in their own land,’ says the LORD, ‘and they shall till it and dwell in it.’”’”"
Jeremiah,27,12,"I also spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, “Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live!"
Jeremiah,27,13,"Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD has spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?"
Jeremiah,27,14,"Therefore do not listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, ‘You shall not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they prophesy a lie to you;"
Jeremiah,27,15,"for I have not sent them,” says the LORD, “yet they prophesy a lie in My name, that I may drive you out, and that you may perish, you and the prophets who prophesy to you.”"
Jeremiah,27,16,"Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, “Behold, the vessels of the LORD’s house will now shortly be brought back from Babylon”; for they prophesy a lie to you."
Jeremiah,27,17,"Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon, and live! Why should this city be laid waste?"
Jeremiah,27,18,"But if they are prophets, and if the word of the LORD is with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, do not go to Babylon.’"
Jeremiah,27,19,"“For thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, concerning the Sea, concerning the carts, and concerning the remainder of the vessels that remain in this city,"
Jeremiah,27,20,"which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem—"
Jeremiah,27,21,"yes, thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem:"
Jeremiah,27,22,"‘They shall be carried to Babylon, and there they shall be until the day that I visit them,’ says the LORD. ‘Then I will bring them up and restore them to this place.’”"
Jeremiah,28,1,"And it happened in the same year, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year and in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, who was from Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the LORD in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,"
Jeremiah,28,2,"“Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying: ‘I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,28,3,"Within two full years I will bring back to this place all the vessels of the LORD’s house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried to Babylon."
Jeremiah,28,4,"And I will bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah who went to Babylon,’ says the LORD, ‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’”"
Jeremiah,28,5,"Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house of the LORD,"
Jeremiah,28,6,"and the prophet Jeremiah said, “Amen! The LORD do so; the LORD perform your words which you have prophesied, to bring back the vessels of the LORD’s house and all who were carried away captive, from Babylon to this place."
Jeremiah,28,7,Nevertheless hear now this word that I speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people:
Jeremiah,28,8,The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many countries and great kingdoms—of war and disaster and pestilence.
Jeremiah,28,9,"As for the prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet comes to pass, the prophet will be known as one whom the LORD has truly sent.”"
Jeremiah,28,10,Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck and broke it.
Jeremiah,28,11,"And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Even so I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years.’” And the prophet Jeremiah went his way."
Jeremiah,28,12,"Now the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,28,13,"“Go and tell Hananiah, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD: “You have broken the yokes of wood, but you have made in their place yokes of iron.”"
Jeremiah,28,14,"For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: “I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him. I have given him the beasts of the field also.”’”"
Jeremiah,28,15,"Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, “Hear now, Hananiah, the LORD has not sent you, but you make this people trust in a lie."
Jeremiah,28,16,"Therefore thus says the LORD: ‘Behold, I will cast you from the face of the earth. This year you shall die, because you have taught rebellion against the LORD.’”"
Jeremiah,28,17,So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
Jeremiah,29,1,"Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the remainder of the elders who were carried away captive—to the priests, the prophets, and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon."
Jeremiah,29,2,"(This happened after Jeconiah the king, the queen mother, the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the smiths had departed from Jerusalem.)"
Jeremiah,29,3,"The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, saying,"
Jeremiah,29,4,"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all who were carried away captive, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon:"
Jeremiah,29,5,Build houses and dwell in them; plant gardens and eat their fruit.
Jeremiah,29,6,"Take wives and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands, so that they may bear sons and daughters—that you may be increased there, and not diminished."
Jeremiah,29,7,"And seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray to the LORD for it; for in its peace you will have peace."
Jeremiah,29,8,"For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Do not let your prophets and your diviners who are in your midst deceive you, nor listen to your dreams which you cause to be dreamed."
Jeremiah,29,9,"For they prophesy falsely to you in My name; I have not sent them, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,29,10,"For thus says the LORD: After seventy years are completed at Babylon, I will visit you and perform My good word toward you, and cause you to return to this place."
Jeremiah,29,11,"For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the LORD, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope."
Jeremiah,29,12,"Then you will call upon Me and go and pray to Me, and I will listen to you."
Jeremiah,29,13,"And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart."
Jeremiah,29,14,"I will be found by you, says the LORD, and I will bring you back from your captivity; I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places where I have driven you, says the LORD, and I will bring you to the place from which I cause you to be carried away captive."
Jeremiah,29,15,"Because you have said, “The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon”—"
Jeremiah,29,16,"therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king who sits on the throne of David, concerning all the people who dwell in this city, and concerning your brethren who have not gone out with you into captivity—"
Jeremiah,29,17,"thus says the LORD of hosts: Behold, I will send on them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like rotten figs that cannot be eaten, they are so bad."
Jeremiah,29,18,"And I will pursue them with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence; and I will deliver them to trouble among all the kingdoms of the earth—to be a curse, an astonishment, a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them,"
Jeremiah,29,19,"because they have not heeded My words, says the LORD, which I sent to them by My servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; neither would you heed, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,29,20,"Therefore hear the word of the LORD, all you of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon."
Jeremiah,29,21,"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you in My name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall slay them before your eyes."
Jeremiah,29,22,"And because of them a curse shall be taken up by all the captivity of Judah who are in Babylon, saying, “The LORD make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire”;"
Jeremiah,29,23,"because they have done disgraceful things in Israel, have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and have spoken lying words in My name, which I have not commanded them. Indeed I know, and am a witness, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,29,24,"You shall also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,"
Jeremiah,29,25,"Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying: You have sent letters in your name to all the people who are at Jerusalem, to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,"
Jeremiah,29,26,"“The LORD has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, so that there should be officers in the house of the LORD over every man who is demented and considers himself a prophet, that you should put him in prison and in the stocks."
Jeremiah,29,27,"Now therefore, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who makes himself a prophet to you?"
Jeremiah,29,28,"For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, ‘This captivity is long; build houses and dwell in them, and plant gardens and eat their fruit.’”"
Jeremiah,29,29,Now Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah,29,30,"Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying:"
Jeremiah,29,31,"Send to all those in captivity, saying, Thus says the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, and I have not sent him, and he has caused you to trust in a lie—"
Jeremiah,29,32,"therefore thus says the LORD: Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his family: he shall not have anyone to dwell among this people, nor shall he see the good that I will do for My people, says the LORD, because he has taught rebellion against the LORD."
Jeremiah,30,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,"
Jeremiah,30,2,"“Thus speaks the LORD God of Israel, saying: ‘Write in a book for yourself all the words that I have spoken to you."
Jeremiah,30,3,"For behold, the days are coming,’ says the LORD, ‘that I will bring back from captivity My people Israel and Judah,’ says the LORD. ‘And I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.’”"
Jeremiah,30,4,Now these are the words that the LORD spoke concerning Israel and Judah.
Jeremiah,30,5,"“For thus says the LORD: ‘We have heard a voice of trembling, Of fear, and not of peace."
Jeremiah,30,6,"Ask now, and see, Whether a man is ever in labor with child? So why do I see every man with his hands on his loins Like a woman in labor, And all faces turned pale?"
Jeremiah,30,7,"Alas! For that day is great, So that none is like it; And it is the time of Jacob’s trouble, But he shall be saved out of it."
Jeremiah,30,8,"‘For it shall come to pass in that day,’ Says the LORD of hosts, ‘That I will break his yoke from your neck, And will burst your bonds; Foreigners shall no more enslave them."
Jeremiah,30,9,"But they shall serve the LORD their God, And David their king, Whom I will raise up for them."
Jeremiah,30,10,"‘Therefore do not fear, O My servant Jacob,’ says the LORD, ‘Nor be dismayed, O Israel; For behold, I will save you from afar, And your seed from the land of their captivity. Jacob shall return, have rest and be quiet, And no one shall make him afraid."
Jeremiah,30,11,"For I am with you,’ says the LORD, ‘to save you; Though I make a full end of all nations where I have scattered you, Yet I will not make a complete end of you. But I will correct you in justice, And will not let you go altogether unpunished.’"
Jeremiah,30,12,"“For thus says the LORD: ‘Your affliction is incurable, Your wound is severe."
Jeremiah,30,13,"There is no one to plead your cause, That you may be bound up; You have no healing medicines."
Jeremiah,30,14,"All your lovers have forgotten you; They do not seek you; For I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, With the chastisement of a cruel one, For the multitude of your iniquities, Because your sins have increased."
Jeremiah,30,15,"Why do you cry about your affliction? Your sorrow is incurable. Because of the multitude of your iniquities, Because your sins have increased, I have done these things to you."
Jeremiah,30,16,"‘Therefore all those who devour you shall be devoured; And all your adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; Those who plunder you shall become plunder, And all who prey upon you I will make a prey."
Jeremiah,30,17,"For I will restore health to you And heal you of your wounds,’ says the LORD, ‘Because they called you an outcast saying: “This is Zion; No one seeks her.”’"
Jeremiah,30,18,"“Thus says the LORD: ‘Behold, I will bring back the captivity of Jacob’s tents, And have mercy on his dwelling places; The city shall be built upon its own mound, And the palace shall remain according to its own plan."
Jeremiah,30,19,"Then out of them shall proceed thanksgiving And the voice of those who make merry; I will multiply them, and they shall not diminish; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small."
Jeremiah,30,20,"Their children also shall be as before, And their congregation shall be established before Me; And I will punish all who oppress them."
Jeremiah,30,21,"Their nobles shall be from among them, And their governor shall come from their midst; Then I will cause him to draw near, And he shall approach Me; For who is this who pledged his heart to approach Me?’ says the LORD."
Jeremiah,30,22,"‘You shall be My people, And I will be your God.’”"
Jeremiah,30,23,"Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD Goes forth with fury, A continuing whirlwind; It will fall violently on the head of the wicked."
Jeremiah,30,24,"The fierce anger of the LORD will not return until He has done it, And until He has performed the intents of His heart. In the latter days you will consider it."
Jeremiah,31,1,"“At the same time,” says the LORD, “I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be My people.”"
Jeremiah,31,2,"Thus says the LORD: “The people who survived the sword Found grace in the wilderness— Israel, when I went to give him rest.”"
Jeremiah,31,3,"The LORD has appeared of old to me, saying: “Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love; Therefore with lovingkindness I have drawn you."
Jeremiah,31,4,"Again I will build you, and you shall be rebuilt, O virgin of Israel! You shall again be adorned with your tambourines, And shall go forth in the dances of those who rejoice."
Jeremiah,31,5,You shall yet plant vines on the mountains of Samaria; The planters shall plant and eat them as ordinary food.
Jeremiah,31,6,"For there shall be a day When the watchmen will cry on Mount Ephraim, ‘Arise, and let us go up to Zion, To the LORD our God.’”"
Jeremiah,31,7,"For thus says the LORD: “Sing with gladness for Jacob, And shout among the chief of the nations; Proclaim, give praise, and say, ‘O LORD, save Your people, The remnant of Israel!’"
Jeremiah,31,8,"Behold, I will bring them from the north country, And gather them from the ends of the earth, Among them the blind and the lame, The woman with child And the one who labors with child, together; A great throng shall return there."
Jeremiah,31,9,"They shall come with weeping, And with supplications I will lead them. I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters, In a straight way in which they shall not stumble; For I am a Father to Israel, And Ephraim is My firstborn."
Jeremiah,31,10,"“Hear the word of the LORD, O nations, And declare it in the isles afar off, and say, ‘He who scattered Israel will gather him, And keep him as a shepherd does his flock.’"
Jeremiah,31,11,"For the LORD has redeemed Jacob, And ransomed him from the hand of one stronger than he."
Jeremiah,31,12,"Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, Streaming to the goodness of the LORD— For wheat and new wine and oil, For the young of the flock and the herd; Their souls shall be like a well-watered garden, And they shall sorrow no more at all."
Jeremiah,31,13,"“Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, And the young men and the old, together; For I will turn their mourning to joy, Will comfort them, And make them rejoice rather than sorrow."
Jeremiah,31,14,"I will satiate the soul of the priests with abundance, And My people shall be satisfied with My goodness, says the LORD.”"
Jeremiah,31,15,"Thus says the LORD: “A voice was heard in Ramah, Lamentation and bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for her children, Refusing to be comforted for her children, Because they are no more.”"
Jeremiah,31,16,"Thus says the LORD: “Refrain your voice from weeping, And your eyes from tears; For your work shall be rewarded, says the LORD, And they shall come back from the land of the enemy."
Jeremiah,31,17,"There is hope in your future, says the LORD, That your children shall come back to their own border."
Jeremiah,31,18,"“I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself: ‘You have chastised me, and I was chastised, Like an untrained bull; Restore me, and I will return, For You are the LORD my God."
Jeremiah,31,19,"Surely, after my turning, I repented; And after I was instructed, I struck myself on the thigh; I was ashamed, yes, even humiliated, Because I bore the reproach of my youth.’"
Jeremiah,31,20,"Is Ephraim My dear son? Is he a pleasant child? For though I spoke against him, I earnestly remember him still; Therefore My heart yearns for him; I will surely have mercy on him, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,31,21,"“Set up signposts, Make landmarks; Set your heart toward the highway, The way in which you went. Turn back, O virgin of Israel, Turn back to these your cities."
Jeremiah,31,22,"How long will you gad about, O you backsliding daughter? For the LORD has created a new thing in the earth— A woman shall encompass a man.”"
Jeremiah,31,23,"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: “They shall again use this speech in the land of Judah and in its cities, when I bring back their captivity: ‘The LORD bless you, O home of justice, and mountain of holiness!’"
Jeremiah,31,24,"And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all its cities together, farmers and those going out with flocks."
Jeremiah,31,25,"For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.”"
Jeremiah,31,26,"After this I awoke and looked around, and my sleep was sweet to me."
Jeremiah,31,27,"“Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and the seed of beast."
Jeremiah,31,28,"And it shall come to pass, that as I have watched over them to pluck up, to break down, to throw down, to destroy, and to afflict, so I will watch over them to build and to plant, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,31,29,"In those days they shall say no more: ‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes, And the children’s teeth are set on edge.’"
Jeremiah,31,30,"But every one shall die for his own iniquity; every man who eats the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge."
Jeremiah,31,31,"“Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah—"
Jeremiah,31,32,"not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, though I was a husband to them, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,31,33,"But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the LORD: I will put My law in their minds, and write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people."
Jeremiah,31,34,"No more shall every man teach his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, ‘Know the LORD,’ for they all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says the LORD. For I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.”"
Jeremiah,31,35,"Thus says the LORD, Who gives the sun for a light by day, The ordinances of the moon and the stars for a light by night, Who disturbs the sea, And its waves roar (The LORD of hosts is His name):"
Jeremiah,31,36,"“If those ordinances depart From before Me, says the LORD, Then the seed of Israel shall also cease From being a nation before Me forever.”"
Jeremiah,31,37,"Thus says the LORD: “If heaven above can be measured, And the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel For all that they have done, says the LORD."
Jeremiah,31,38,"“Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, that the city shall be built for the LORD from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate."
Jeremiah,31,39,The surveyor’s line shall again extend straight forward over the hill Gareb; then it shall turn toward Goath.
Jeremiah,31,40,"And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields as far as the Brook Kidron, to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east, shall be holy to the LORD. It shall not be plucked up or thrown down anymore forever.”"
Jeremiah,32,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar."
Jeremiah,32,2,"For then the king of Babylon’s army besieged Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the king of Judah’s house."
Jeremiah,32,3,"For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, “Why do you prophesy and say, ‘Thus says the LORD: “Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;"
Jeremiah,32,4,"and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him face to face, and see him eye to eye;"
Jeremiah,32,5,"then he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there he shall be until I visit him,” says the LORD; “though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not succeed”’?”"
Jeremiah,32,6,"And Jeremiah said, “The word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Jeremiah,32,7,"‘Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you, saying, “Buy my field which is in Anathoth, for the right of redemption is yours to buy it.”’"
Jeremiah,32,8,"Then Hanamel my uncle’s son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said to me, ‘Please buy my field that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption yours; buy it for yourself.’ Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD."
Jeremiah,32,9,"So I bought the field from Hanamel, the son of my uncle who was in Anathoth, and weighed out to him the money—seventeen shekels of silver."
Jeremiah,32,10,"And I signed the deed and sealed it, took witnesses, and weighed the money on the scales."
Jeremiah,32,11,"So I took the purchase deed, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open;"
Jeremiah,32,12,"and I gave the purchase deed to Baruch the son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my uncle’s son, and in the presence of the witnesses who signed the purchase deed, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the prison."
Jeremiah,32,13,"“Then I charged Baruch before them, saying,"
Jeremiah,32,14,"‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: “Take these deeds, both this purchase deed which is sealed and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may last many days.”"
Jeremiah,32,15,"For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: “Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.”’"
Jeremiah,32,16,"“Now when I had delivered the purchase deed to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD, saying:"
Jeremiah,32,17,"‘Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm. There is nothing too hard for You."
Jeremiah,32,18,"You show lovingkindness to thousands, and repay the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them—the Great, the Mighty God, whose name is the LORD of hosts."
Jeremiah,32,19,"You are great in counsel and mighty in work, for Your eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of men, to give everyone according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings."
Jeremiah,32,20,"You have set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, to this day, and in Israel and among other men; and You have made Yourself a name, as it is this day."
Jeremiah,32,21,"You have brought Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terror;"
Jeremiah,32,22,"You have given them this land, of which You swore to their fathers to give them—“a land flowing with milk and honey.”"
Jeremiah,32,23,"And they came in and took possession of it, but they have not obeyed Your voice or walked in Your law. They have done nothing of all that You commanded them to do; therefore You have caused all this calamity to come upon them."
Jeremiah,32,24,"‘Look, the siege mounds! They have come to the city to take it; and the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword and famine and pestilence. What You have spoken has happened; there You see it!"
Jeremiah,32,25,"And You have said to me, O Lord GOD, “Buy the field for money, and take witnesses”!—yet the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’”"
Jeremiah,32,26,"Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,32,27,"“Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for Me?"
Jeremiah,32,28,"Therefore thus says the LORD: ‘Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it."
Jeremiah,32,29,"And the Chaldeans who fight against this city shall come and set fire to this city and burn it, with the houses on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal and poured out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke Me to anger;"
Jeremiah,32,30,"because the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only evil before Me from their youth. For the children of Israel have provoked Me only to anger with the work of their hands,’ says the LORD."
Jeremiah,32,31,"‘For this city has been to Me a provocation of My anger and My fury from the day that they built it, even to this day; so I will remove it from before My face"
Jeremiah,32,32,"because of all the evil of the children of Israel and the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke Me to anger—they, their kings, their princes, their priests, their prophets, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,32,33,"And they have turned to Me the back, and not the face; though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive instruction."
Jeremiah,32,34,"But they set their abominations in the house which is called by My name, to defile it."
Jeremiah,32,35,"And they built the high places of Baal which are in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech, which I did not command them, nor did it come into My mind that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.’"
Jeremiah,32,36,"“Now therefore, thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city of which you say, ‘It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence’:"
Jeremiah,32,37,"Behold, I will gather them out of all countries where I have driven them in My anger, in My fury, and in great wrath; I will bring them back to this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely."
Jeremiah,32,38,"They shall be My people, and I will be their God;"
Jeremiah,32,39,"then I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me forever, for the good of them and their children after them."
Jeremiah,32,40,"And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from doing them good; but I will put My fear in their hearts so that they will not depart from Me."
Jeremiah,32,41,"Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will assuredly plant them in this land, with all My heart and with all My soul.’"
Jeremiah,32,42,"“For thus says the LORD: ‘Just as I have brought all this great calamity on this people, so I will bring on them all the good that I have promised them."
Jeremiah,32,43,"And fields will be bought in this land of which you say, “It is desolate, without man or beast; it has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.”"
Jeremiah,32,44,"Men will buy fields for money, sign deeds and seal them, and take witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, in the places around Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South; for I will cause their captives to return,’ says the LORD.”"
Jeremiah,33,1,"Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah a second time, while he was still shut up in the court of the prison, saying,"
Jeremiah,33,2,"“Thus says the LORD who made it, the LORD who formed it to establish it (the LORD is His name):"
Jeremiah,33,3,"‘Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know.’"
Jeremiah,33,4,"“For thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and the houses of the kings of Judah, which have been pulled down to fortify against the siege mounds and the sword:"
Jeremiah,33,5,"‘They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but only to fill their places with the dead bodies of men whom I will slay in My anger and My fury, all for whose wickedness I have hidden My face from this city."
Jeremiah,33,6,"Behold, I will bring it health and healing; I will heal them and reveal to them the abundance of peace and truth."
Jeremiah,33,7,"And I will cause the captives of Judah and the captives of Israel to return, and will rebuild those places as at the first."
Jeremiah,33,8,"I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against Me, and I will pardon all their iniquities by which they have sinned and by which they have transgressed against Me."
Jeremiah,33,9,"Then it shall be to Me a name of joy, a praise, and an honor before all nations of the earth, who shall hear all the good that I do to them; they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and all the prosperity that I provide for it.’"
Jeremiah,33,10,"“Thus says the LORD: ‘Again there shall be heard in this place—of which you say, “It is desolate, without man and without beast”—in the cities of Judah, in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without beast,"
Jeremiah,33,11,"the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who will say: “Praise the LORD of hosts, For the LORD is good, For His mercy endures forever”— and of those who will bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause the captives of the land to return as at the first,’ says the LORD."
Jeremiah,33,12,"“Thus says the LORD of hosts: ‘In this place which is desolate, without man and without beast, and in all its cities, there shall again be a dwelling place of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down."
Jeremiah,33,13,"In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the lowland, in the cities of the South, in the land of Benjamin, in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, the flocks shall again pass under the hands of him who counts them,’ says the LORD."
Jeremiah,33,14,"‘Behold, the days are coming,’ says the LORD, ‘that I will perform that good thing which I have promised to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah:"
Jeremiah,33,15,‘In those days and at that time I will cause to grow up to David A Branch of righteousness; He shall execute judgment and righteousness in the earth.
Jeremiah,33,16,"In those days Judah will be saved, And Jerusalem will dwell safely. And this is the name by which she will be called: THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.’"
Jeremiah,33,17,“For thus says the LORD: ‘David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel;
Jeremiah,33,18,"nor shall the priests, the Levites, lack a man to offer burnt offerings before Me, to kindle grain offerings, and to sacrifice continually.’”"
Jeremiah,33,19,"And the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,33,20,"“Thus says the LORD: ‘If you can break My covenant with the day and My covenant with the night, so that there will not be day and night in their season,"
Jeremiah,33,21,"then My covenant may also be broken with David My servant, so that he shall not have a son to reign on his throne, and with the Levites, the priests, My ministers."
Jeremiah,33,22,"As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, nor the sand of the sea measured, so will I multiply the descendants of David My servant and the Levites who minister to Me.’”"
Jeremiah,33,23,"Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,33,24,"“Have you not considered what these people have spoken, saying, ‘The two families which the LORD has chosen, He has also cast them off’? Thus they have despised My people, as if they should no more be a nation before them."
Jeremiah,33,25,"“Thus says the LORD: ‘If My covenant is not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth,"
Jeremiah,33,26,"then I will cast away the descendants of Jacob and David My servant, so that I will not take any of his descendants to be rulers over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will cause their captives to return, and will have mercy on them.’”"
Jeremiah,34,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army, all the kingdoms of the earth under his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem and all its cities, saying,"
Jeremiah,34,2,"“Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: ‘Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and tell him, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire."
Jeremiah,34,3,"And you shall not escape from his hand, but shall surely be taken and delivered into his hand; your eyes shall see the eyes of the king of Babylon, he shall speak with you face to face, and you shall go to Babylon.’”’"
Jeremiah,34,4,"Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah! Thus says the LORD concerning you: ‘You shall not die by the sword."
Jeremiah,34,5,"You shall die in peace; as in the ceremonies of your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so they shall burn incense for you and lament for you, saying, “Alas, lord!” For I have pronounced the word, says the LORD.’”"
Jeremiah,34,6,"Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,"
Jeremiah,34,7,"when the king of Babylon’s army fought against Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and Azekah; for only these fortified cities remained of the cities of Judah."
Jeremiah,34,8,"This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem to proclaim liberty to them:"
Jeremiah,34,9,that every man should set free his male and female slave—a Hebrew man or woman—that no one should keep a Jewish brother in bondage.
Jeremiah,34,10,"Now when all the princes and all the people, who had entered into the covenant, heard that everyone should set free his male and female slaves, that no one should keep them in bondage anymore, they obeyed and let them go."
Jeremiah,34,11,"But afterward they changed their minds and made the male and female slaves return, whom they had set free, and brought them into subjection as male and female slaves."
Jeremiah,34,12,"Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,"
Jeremiah,34,13,"“Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: ‘I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,"
Jeremiah,34,14,"“At the end of seven years let every man set free his Hebrew brother, who has been sold to him; and when he has served you six years, you shall let him go free from you.” But your fathers did not obey Me nor incline their ear."
Jeremiah,34,15,Then you recently turned and did what was right in My sight—every man proclaiming liberty to his neighbor; and you made a covenant before Me in the house which is called by My name.
Jeremiah,34,16,"Then you turned around and profaned My name, and every one of you brought back his male and female slaves, whom you had set at liberty, at their pleasure, and brought them back into subjection, to be your male and female slaves.’"
Jeremiah,34,17,"“Therefore thus says the LORD: ‘You have not obeyed Me in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother and every one to his neighbor. Behold, I proclaim liberty to you,’ says the LORD—‘to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine! And I will deliver you to trouble among all the kingdoms of the earth."
Jeremiah,34,18,"And I will give the men who have transgressed My covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before Me, when they cut the calf in two and passed between the parts of it—"
Jeremiah,34,19,"the princes of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf—"
Jeremiah,34,20,I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their life. Their dead bodies shall be for meat for the birds of the heaven and the beasts of the earth.
Jeremiah,34,21,"And I will give Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes into the hand of their enemies, into the hand of those who seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army which has gone back from you."
Jeremiah,34,22,"Behold, I will command,’ says the LORD, ‘and cause them to return to this city. They will fight against it and take it and burn it with fire; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant.’”"
Jeremiah,35,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,"
Jeremiah,35,2,"“Go to the house of the Rechabites, speak to them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.”"
Jeremiah,35,3,"Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, his brothers and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites,"
Jeremiah,35,4,"and I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door."
Jeremiah,35,5,"Then I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, “Drink wine.”"
Jeremiah,35,6,"But they said, “We will drink no wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, ‘You shall drink no wine, you nor your sons, forever."
Jeremiah,35,7,"You shall not build a house, sow seed, plant a vineyard, nor have any of these; but all your days you shall dwell in tents, that you may live many days in the land where you are sojourners.’"
Jeremiah,35,8,"Thus we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters,"
Jeremiah,35,9,"nor to build ourselves houses to dwell in; nor do we have vineyard, field, or seed."
Jeremiah,35,10,"But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us."
Jeremiah,35,11,"But it came to pass, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, ‘Come, let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and for fear of the army of the Syrians.’ So we dwell at Jerusalem.”"
Jeremiah,35,12,"Then came the word of the LORD to Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,35,13,"“Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, “Will you not receive instruction to obey My words?” says the LORD."
Jeremiah,35,14,"“The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, which he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are performed; for to this day they drink none, and obey their father’s commandment. But although I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking, you did not obey Me."
Jeremiah,35,15,"I have also sent to you all My servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, ‘Turn now everyone from his evil way, amend your doings, and do not go after other gods to serve them; then you will dwell in the land which I have given you and your fathers.’ But you have not inclined your ear, nor obeyed Me."
Jeremiah,35,16,"Surely the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them, but this people has not obeyed Me.”’"
Jeremiah,35,17,"“Therefore thus says the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘Behold, I will bring on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the doom that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken to them but they have not heard, and I have called to them but they have not answered.’”"
Jeremiah,35,18,"And Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘Because you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts and done according to all that he commanded you,"
Jeremiah,35,19,"therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: “Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not lack a man to stand before Me forever.”’”"
Jeremiah,36,1,"Now it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, that this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying:"
Jeremiah,36,2,"“Take a scroll of a book and write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel, against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah even to this day."
Jeremiah,36,3,"It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the adversities which I purpose to bring upon them, that everyone may turn from his evil way, that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.”"
Jeremiah,36,4,"Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote on a scroll of a book, at the instruction of Jeremiah, all the words of the LORD which He had spoken to him."
Jeremiah,36,5,"And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, “I am confined, I cannot go into the house of the LORD."
Jeremiah,36,6,"You go, therefore, and read from the scroll which you have written at my instruction, the words of the LORD, in the hearing of the people in the LORD’s house on the day of fasting. And you shall also read them in the hearing of all Judah who come from their cities."
Jeremiah,36,7,"It may be that they will present their supplication before the LORD, and everyone will turn from his evil way. For great is the anger and the fury that the LORD has pronounced against this people.”"
Jeremiah,36,8,"And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading from the book the words of the LORD in the LORD’s house."
Jeremiah,36,9,"Now it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,36,10,"Then Baruch read from the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper court at the entry of the New Gate of the LORD’s house, in the hearing of all the people."
Jeremiah,36,11,"When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the book,"
Jeremiah,36,12,"he then went down to the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber; and there all the princes were sitting—Elishama the scribe, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes."
Jeremiah,36,13,Then Michaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read the book in the hearing of the people.
Jeremiah,36,14,"Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, “Take in your hand the scroll from which you have read in the hearing of the people, and come.” So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them."
Jeremiah,36,15,"And they said to him, “Sit down now, and read it in our hearing.” So Baruch read it in their hearing."
Jeremiah,36,16,"Now it happened, when they had heard all the words, that they looked in fear from one to another, and said to Baruch, “We will surely tell the king of all these words.”"
Jeremiah,36,17,"And they asked Baruch, saying, “Tell us now, how did you write all these words—at his instruction?”"
Jeremiah,36,18,"So Baruch answered them, “He proclaimed with his mouth all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink in the book.”"
Jeremiah,36,19,"Then the princes said to Baruch, “Go and hide, you and Jeremiah; and let no one know where you are.”"
Jeremiah,36,20,"And they went to the king, into the court; but they stored the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the hearing of the king."
Jeremiah,36,21,"So the king sent Jehudi to bring the scroll, and he took it from Elishama the scribe’s chamber. And Jehudi read it in the hearing of the king and in the hearing of all the princes who stood beside the king."
Jeremiah,36,22,"Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month, with a fire burning on the hearth before him."
Jeremiah,36,23,"And it happened, when Jehudi had read three or four columns, that the king cut it with the scribe’s knife and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth."
Jeremiah,36,24,"Yet they were not afraid, nor did they tear their garments, the king nor any of his servants who heard all these words."
Jeremiah,36,25,"Nevertheless Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah implored the king not to burn the scroll; but he would not listen to them."
Jeremiah,36,26,"And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet, but the LORD hid them."
Jeremiah,36,27,"Now after the king had burned the scroll with the words which Baruch had written at the instruction of Jeremiah, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying:"
Jeremiah,36,28,"“Take yet another scroll, and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned."
Jeremiah,36,29,"And you shall say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, ‘Thus says the LORD: “You have burned this scroll, saying, ‘Why have you written in it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and cause man and beast to cease from here?’”"
Jeremiah,36,30,"Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: “He shall have no one to sit on the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat of the day and the frost of the night."
Jeremiah,36,31,"I will punish him, his family, and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring on them, on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah all the doom that I have pronounced against them; but they did not heed.”’”"
Jeremiah,36,32,"Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote on it at the instruction of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And besides, there were added to them many similar words."
Jeremiah,37,1,"Now King Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah."
Jeremiah,37,2,But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land gave heed to the words of the LORD which He spoke by the prophet Jeremiah.
Jeremiah,37,3,"And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, “Pray now to the LORD our God for us.”"
Jeremiah,37,4,"Now Jeremiah was coming and going among the people, for they had not yet put him in prison."
Jeremiah,37,5,"Then Pharaoh’s army came up from Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they departed from Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,37,6,"Then the word of the LORD came to the prophet Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,37,7,"“Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘Thus you shall say to the king of Judah, who sent you to Me to inquire of Me: “Behold, Pharaoh’s army which has come up to help you will return to Egypt, to their own land."
Jeremiah,37,8,"And the Chaldeans shall come back and fight against this city, and take it and burn it with fire.”’"
Jeremiah,37,9,"Thus says the LORD: ‘Do not deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeans will surely depart from us,” for they will not depart."
Jeremiah,37,10,"For though you had defeated the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and there remained only wounded men among them, they would rise up, every man in his tent, and burn the city with fire.’”"
Jeremiah,37,11,"And it happened, when the army of the Chaldeans left the siege of Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army,"
Jeremiah,37,12,that Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin to claim his property there among the people.
Jeremiah,37,13,"And when he was in the Gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard was there whose name was Irijah the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are defecting to the Chaldeans!”"
Jeremiah,37,14,"Then Jeremiah said, “False! I am not defecting to the Chaldeans.” But he did not listen to him. So Irijah seized Jeremiah and brought him to the princes."
Jeremiah,37,15,"Therefore the princes were angry with Jeremiah, and they struck him and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe. For they had made that the prison."
Jeremiah,37,16,"When Jeremiah entered the dungeon and the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days,"
Jeremiah,37,17,"then Zedekiah the king sent and took him out. The king asked him secretly in his house, and said, “Is there any word from the LORD?” And Jeremiah said, “There is.” Then he said, “You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon!”"
Jeremiah,37,18,"Moreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “What offense have I committed against you, against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison?"
Jeremiah,37,19,"Where now are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you or against this land’?"
Jeremiah,37,20,"Therefore please hear now, O my lord the king. Please, let my petition be accepted before you, and do not make me return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.”"
Jeremiah,37,21,"Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah to the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread from the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city was gone. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison."
Jeremiah,38,1,"Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken to all the people, saying,"
Jeremiah,38,2,"“Thus says the LORD: ‘He who remains in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence; but he who goes over to the Chaldeans shall live; his life shall be as a prize to him, and he shall live.’"
Jeremiah,38,3,"Thus says the LORD: ‘This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, which shall take it.’”"
Jeremiah,38,4,"Therefore the princes said to the king, “Please, let this man be put to death, for thus he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man does not seek the welfare of this people, but their harm.”"
Jeremiah,38,5,"Then Zedekiah the king said, “Look, he is in your hand. For the king can do nothing against you.”"
Jeremiah,38,6,"So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the king’s son, which was in the court of the prison, and they let Jeremiah down with ropes. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire. So Jeremiah sank in the mire."
Jeremiah,38,7,"Now Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs, who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon. When the king was sitting at the Gate of Benjamin,"
Jeremiah,38,8,"Ebed-Melech went out of the king’s house and spoke to the king, saying:"
Jeremiah,38,9,"“My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon, and he is likely to die from hunger in the place where he is. For there is no more bread in the city.”"
Jeremiah,38,10,"Then the king commanded Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian, saying, “Take from here thirty men with you, and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon before he dies.”"
Jeremiah,38,11,"So Ebed-Melech took the men with him and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took from there old clothes and old rags, and let them down by ropes into the dungeon to Jeremiah."
Jeremiah,38,12,"Then Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Please put these old clothes and rags under your armpits, under the ropes.” And Jeremiah did so."
Jeremiah,38,13,So they pulled Jeremiah up with ropes and lifted him out of the dungeon. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
Jeremiah,38,14,"Then Zedekiah the king sent and had Jeremiah the prophet brought to him at the third entrance of the house of the LORD. And the king said to Jeremiah, “I will ask you something. Hide nothing from me.”"
Jeremiah,38,15,"Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I declare it to you, will you not surely put me to death? And if I give you advice, you will not listen to me.”"
Jeremiah,38,16,"So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, “As the LORD lives, who made our very souls, I will not put you to death, nor will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life.”"
Jeremiah,38,17,"Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘If you surely surrender to the king of Babylon’s princes, then your soul shall live; this city shall not be burned with fire, and you and your house shall live."
Jeremiah,38,18,"But if you do not surrender to the king of Babylon’s princes, then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans; they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape from their hand.’”"
Jeremiah,38,19,"And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have defected to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they abuse me.”"
Jeremiah,38,20,"But Jeremiah said, “They shall not deliver you. Please, obey the voice of the LORD which I speak to you. So it shall be well with you, and your soul shall live."
Jeremiah,38,21,"But if you refuse to surrender, this is the word that the LORD has shown me:"
Jeremiah,38,22,"‘Now behold, all the women who are left in the king of Judah’s house shall be surrendered to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those women shall say: “Your close friends have set upon you And prevailed against you; Your feet have sunk in the mire, And they have turned away again.”"
Jeremiah,38,23,"‘So they shall surrender all your wives and children to the Chaldeans. You shall not escape from their hand, but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon. And you shall cause this city to be burned with fire.’”"
Jeremiah,38,24,"Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no one know of these words, and you shall not die."
Jeremiah,38,25,"But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you and say to you, ‘Declare to us now what you have said to the king, and also what the king said to you; do not hide it from us, and we will not put you to death,’"
Jeremiah,38,26,"then you shall say to them, ‘I presented my request before the king, that he would not make me return to Jonathan’s house to die there.’”"
Jeremiah,38,27,"Then all the princes came to Jeremiah and asked him. And he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they stopped speaking with him, for the conversation had not been heard."
Jeremiah,38,28,Now Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken. And he was there when Jerusalem was taken.
Jeremiah,39,1,"In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem, and besieged it."
Jeremiah,39,2,"In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the city was penetrated."
Jeremiah,39,3,"Then all the princes of the king of Babylon came in and sat in the Middle Gate: Nergal-Sharezer, Samgar-Nebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergal-Sarezer, Rabmag, with the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,39,4,"So it was, when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, that they fled and went out of the city by night, by way of the king’s garden, by the gate between the two walls. And he went out by way of the plain."
Jeremiah,39,5,"But the Chaldean army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And when they had captured him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced judgment on him."
Jeremiah,39,6,Then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes in Riblah; the king of Babylon also killed all the nobles of Judah.
Jeremiah,39,7,"Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him with bronze fetters to carry him off to Babylon."
Jeremiah,39,8,"And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house and the houses of the people with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,39,9,"Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive to Babylon the remnant of the people who remained in the city and those who defected to him, with the rest of the people who remained."
Jeremiah,39,10,"But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left in the land of Judah the poor people, who had nothing, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time."
Jeremiah,39,11,"Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,"
Jeremiah,39,12,"“Take him and look after him, and do him no harm; but do to him just as he says to you.”"
Jeremiah,39,13,"So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent Nebushasban, Rabsaris, Nergal-Sharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon’s chief officers;"
Jeremiah,39,14,"then they sent someone to take Jeremiah from the court of the prison, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should take him home. So he dwelt among the people."
Jeremiah,39,15,"Meanwhile the word of the LORD had come to Jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,"
Jeremiah,39,16,"“Go and speak to Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: “Behold, I will bring My words upon this city for adversity and not for good, and they shall be performed in that day before you."
Jeremiah,39,17,"But I will deliver you in that day,” says the LORD, “and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid."
Jeremiah,39,18,"For I will surely deliver you, and you shall not fall by the sword; but your life shall be as a prize to you, because you have put your trust in Me,” says the LORD.’”"
Jeremiah,40,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him bound in chains among all who were carried away captive from Jerusalem and Judah, who were carried away captive to Babylon."
Jeremiah,40,2,And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him: “The LORD your God has pronounced this doom on this place.
Jeremiah,40,3,"Now the LORD has brought it, and has done just as He said. Because you people have sinned against the LORD, and not obeyed His voice, therefore this thing has come upon you."
Jeremiah,40,4,"And now look, I free you this day from the chains that were on your hand. If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will look after you. But if it seems wrong for you to come with me to Babylon, remain here. See, all the land is before you; wherever it seems good and convenient for you to go, go there.”"
Jeremiah,40,5,"Now while Jeremiah had not yet gone back, Nebuzaradan said, “Go back to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people. Or go wherever it seems convenient for you to go.” So the captain of the guard gave him rations and a gift and let him go."
Jeremiah,40,6,"Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, to Mizpah, and dwelt with him among the people who were left in the land."
Jeremiah,40,7,"And when all the captains of the armies who were in the fields, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, women, children, and the poorest of the land who had not been carried away captive to Babylon,"
Jeremiah,40,8,"then they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men."
Jeremiah,40,9,"And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, took an oath before them and their men, saying, “Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you."
Jeremiah,40,10,"As for me, I will indeed dwell at Mizpah and serve the Chaldeans who come to us. But you, gather wine and summer fruit and oil, put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.”"
Jeremiah,40,11,"Likewise, when all the Jews who were in Moab, among the Ammonites, in Edom, and who were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan,"
Jeremiah,40,12,"then all the Jews returned out of all places where they had been driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruit in abundance."
Jeremiah,40,13,"Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields came to Gedaliah at Mizpah,"
Jeremiah,40,14,"and said to him, “Do you certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to murder you?” But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam did not believe them."
Jeremiah,40,15,"Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah in Mizpah, saying, “Let me go, please, and I will kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he murder you, so that all the Jews who are gathered to you would be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?”"
Jeremiah,40,16,"But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “You shall not do this thing, for you speak falsely concerning Ishmael.”"
Jeremiah,41,1,"Now it came to pass in the seventh month that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal family and of the officers of the king, came with ten men to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at Mizpah. And there they ate bread together in Mizpah."
Jeremiah,41,2,"Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men who were with him, arose and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword, and killed him whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land."
Jeremiah,41,3,"Ishmael also struck down all the Jews who were with him, that is, with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war."
Jeremiah,41,4,"And it happened, on the second day after he had killed Gedaliah, when as yet no one knew it,"
Jeremiah,41,5,"that certain men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, eighty men with their beards shaved and their clothes torn, having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the LORD."
Jeremiah,41,6,"Now Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went along; and it happened as he met them that he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam!”"
Jeremiah,41,7,"So it was, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them and cast them into the midst of a pit, he and the men who were with him."
Jeremiah,41,8,"But ten men were found among them who said to Ishmael, “Do not kill us, for we have treasures of wheat, barley, oil, and honey in the field.” So he desisted and did not kill them among their brethren."
Jeremiah,41,9,"Now the pit into which Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain, because of Gedaliah, was the same one Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain."
Jeremiah,41,10,"Then Ishmael carried away captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah, the king’s daughters and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive and departed to go over to the Ammonites."
Jeremiah,41,11,"But when Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,"
Jeremiah,41,12,they took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah; and they found him by the great pool that is in Gibeon.
Jeremiah,41,13,"So it was, when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, that they were glad."
Jeremiah,41,14,"Then all the people whom Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah."
Jeremiah,41,15,But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to the Ammonites.
Jeremiah,41,16,"Then Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, took from Mizpah all the rest of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah after he had murdered Gedaliah the son of Ahikam—the mighty men of war and the women and the children and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon."
Jeremiah,41,17,"And they departed and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is near Bethlehem, as they went on their way to Egypt,"
Jeremiah,41,18,"because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had murdered Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had made governor in the land."
Jeremiah,42,1,"Now all the captains of the forces, Johanan the son of Kareah, Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people, from the least to the greatest, came near"
Jeremiah,42,2,"and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “Please, let our petition be acceptable to you, and pray for us to the LORD your God, for all this remnant (since we are left but a few of many, as you can see),"
Jeremiah,42,3,that the LORD your God may show us the way in which we should walk and the thing we should do.”
Jeremiah,42,4,"Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard. Indeed, I will pray to the LORD your God according to your words, and it shall be, that whatever the LORD answers you, I will declare it to you. I will keep nothing back from you.”"
Jeremiah,42,5,"So they said to Jeremiah, “Let the LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not do according to everything which the LORD your God sends us by you."
Jeremiah,42,6,"Whether it is pleasing or displeasing, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God to whom we send you, that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.”"
Jeremiah,42,7,And it happened after ten days that the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah.
Jeremiah,42,8,"Then he called Johanan the son of Kareah, all the captains of the forces which were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,"
Jeremiah,42,9,"and said to them, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your petition before Him:"
Jeremiah,42,10,"‘If you will still remain in this land, then I will build you and not pull you down, and I will plant you and not pluck you up. For I relent concerning the disaster that I have brought upon you."
Jeremiah,42,11,"Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid; do not be afraid of him,’ says the LORD, ‘for I am with you, to save you and deliver you from his hand."
Jeremiah,42,12,"And I will show you mercy, that he may have mercy on you and cause you to return to your own land.’"
Jeremiah,42,13,"“But if you say, ‘We will not dwell in this land,’ disobeying the voice of the LORD your God,"
Jeremiah,42,14,"saying, ‘No, but we will go to the land of Egypt where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor be hungry for bread, and there we will dwell’—"
Jeremiah,42,15,"Then hear now the word of the LORD, O remnant of Judah! Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘If you wholly set your faces to enter Egypt, and go to dwell there,"
Jeremiah,42,16,then it shall be that the sword which you feared shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; the famine of which you were afraid shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there you shall die.
Jeremiah,42,17,"So shall it be with all the men who set their faces to go to Egypt to dwell there. They shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. And none of them shall remain or escape from the disaster that I will bring upon them.’"
Jeremiah,42,18,"“For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘As My anger and My fury have been poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so will My fury be poured out on you when you enter Egypt. And you shall be an oath, an astonishment, a curse, and a reproach; and you shall see this place no more.’"
Jeremiah,42,19,"“The LORD has said concerning you, O remnant of Judah, ‘Do not go to Egypt!’ Know certainly that I have admonished you this day."
Jeremiah,42,20,"For you were hypocrites in your hearts when you sent me to the LORD your God, saying, ‘Pray for us to the LORD our God, and according to all that the LORD your God says, so declare to us and we will do it.’"
Jeremiah,42,21,"And I have this day declared it to you, but you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, or anything which He has sent you by me."
Jeremiah,42,22,"Now therefore, know certainly that you shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence in the place where you desire to go to dwell.”"
Jeremiah,43,1,"Now it happened, when Jeremiah had stopped speaking to all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, all these words,"
Jeremiah,43,2,"that Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men spoke, saying to Jeremiah, “You speak falsely! The LORD our God has not sent you to say, ‘Do not go to Egypt to dwell there.’"
Jeremiah,43,3,"But Baruch the son of Neriah has set you against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death or carry us away captive to Babylon.”"
Jeremiah,43,4,"So Johanan the son of Kareah, all the captains of the forces, and all the people would not obey the voice of the LORD, to remain in the land of Judah."
Jeremiah,43,5,"But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces took all the remnant of Judah who had returned to dwell in the land of Judah, from all nations where they had been driven—"
Jeremiah,43,6,"men, women, children, the king’s daughters, and every person whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah."
Jeremiah,43,7,"So they went to the land of Egypt, for they did not obey the voice of the LORD. And they went as far as Tahpanhes."
Jeremiah,43,8,"Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,"
Jeremiah,43,9,"“Take large stones in your hand, and hide them in the sight of the men of Judah, in the clay in the brick courtyard which is at the entrance to Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes;"
Jeremiah,43,10,"and say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: “Behold, I will send and bring Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant, and will set his throne above these stones that I have hidden. And he will spread his royal pavilion over them."
Jeremiah,43,11,"When he comes, he shall strike the land of Egypt and deliver to death those appointed for death, and to captivity those appointed for captivity, and to the sword those appointed for the sword."
Jeremiah,43,12,"I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt, and he shall burn them and carry them away captive. And he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd puts on his garment, and he shall go out from there in peace."
Jeremiah,43,13,He shall also break the sacred pillars of Beth Shemesh that are in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians he shall burn with fire.”’”
Jeremiah,44,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who dwell in the land of Egypt, who dwell at Migdol, at Tahpanhes, at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,"
Jeremiah,44,2,"“Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘You have seen all the calamity that I have brought on Jerusalem and on all the cities of Judah; and behold, this day they are a desolation, and no one dwells in them,"
Jeremiah,44,3,"because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke Me to anger, in that they went to burn incense and to serve other gods whom they did not know, they nor you nor your fathers."
Jeremiah,44,4,"However I have sent to you all My servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, “Oh, do not do this abominable thing that I hate!”"
Jeremiah,44,5,"But they did not listen or incline their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense to other gods."
Jeremiah,44,6,"So My fury and My anger were poured out and kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as it is this day.’"
Jeremiah,44,7,"“Now therefore, thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘Why do you commit this great evil against yourselves, to cut off from you man and woman, child and infant, out of Judah, leaving none to remain,"
Jeremiah,44,8,"in that you provoke Me to wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have gone to dwell, that you may cut yourselves off and be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?"
Jeremiah,44,9,"Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, the wickedness of the kings of Judah, the wickedness of their wives, your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?"
Jeremiah,44,10,"They have not been humbled, to this day, nor have they feared; they have not walked in My law or in My statutes that I set before you and your fathers.’"
Jeremiah,44,11,"“Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘Behold, I will set My face against you for catastrophe and for cutting off all Judah."
Jeremiah,44,12,"And I will take the remnant of Judah who have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to dwell there, and they shall all be consumed and fall in the land of Egypt. They shall be consumed by the sword and by famine. They shall die, from the least to the greatest, by the sword and by famine; and they shall be an oath, an astonishment, a curse and a reproach!"
Jeremiah,44,13,"For I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence,"
Jeremiah,44,14,"so that none of the remnant of Judah who have gone into the land of Egypt to dwell there shall escape or survive, lest they return to the land of Judah, to which they desire to return and dwell. For none shall return except those who escape.’”"
Jeremiah,44,15,"Then all the men who knew that their wives had burned incense to other gods, with all the women who stood by, a great multitude, and all the people who dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying:"
Jeremiah,44,16,"“As for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD, we will not listen to you!"
Jeremiah,44,17,"But we will certainly do whatever has gone out of our own mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. For then we had plenty of food, were well-off, and saw no trouble."
Jeremiah,44,18,"But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have been consumed by the sword and by famine.”"
Jeremiah,44,19,"The women also said, “And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, did we make cakes for her, to worship her, and pour out drink offerings to her without our husbands’ permission?”"
Jeremiah,44,20,"Then Jeremiah spoke to all the people—the men, the women, and all the people who had given him that answer—saying:"
Jeremiah,44,21,"“The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and did it not come into His mind?"
Jeremiah,44,22,"So the LORD could no longer bear it, because of the evil of your doings and because of the abominations which you committed. Therefore your land is a desolation, an astonishment, a curse, and without an inhabitant, as it is this day."
Jeremiah,44,23,"Because you have burned incense and because you have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD or walked in His law, in His statutes or in His testimonies, therefore this calamity has happened to you, as at this day.”"
Jeremiah,44,24,"Moreover Jeremiah said to all the people and to all the women, “Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt!"
Jeremiah,44,25,"Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying: ‘You and your wives have spoken with your mouths and fulfilled with your hands, saying, “We will surely keep our vows that we have made, to burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her.” You will surely keep your vows and perform your vows!’"
Jeremiah,44,26,"Therefore hear the word of the LORD, all Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt: ‘Behold, I have sworn by My great name,’ says the LORD, ‘that My name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, “The Lord GOD lives.”"
Jeremiah,44,27,"Behold, I will watch over them for adversity and not for good. And all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by famine, until there is an end to them."
Jeremiah,44,28,"Yet a small number who escape the sword shall return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah; and all the remnant of Judah, who have gone to the land of Egypt to dwell there, shall know whose words will stand, Mine or theirs."
Jeremiah,44,29,"And this shall be a sign to you,’ says the LORD, ‘that I will punish you in this place, that you may know that My words will surely stand against you for adversity.’"
Jeremiah,44,30,"“Thus says the LORD: ‘Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of those who seek his life, as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, his enemy who sought his life.’”"
Jeremiah,45,1,"The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the instruction of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,"
Jeremiah,45,2,"“Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch:"
Jeremiah,45,3,"‘You said, “Woe is me now! For the LORD has added grief to my sorrow. I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.”’"
Jeremiah,45,4,"“Thus you shall say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD: “Behold, what I have built I will break down, and what I have planted I will pluck up, that is, this whole land."
Jeremiah,45,5,"And do you seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them; for behold, I will bring adversity on all flesh,” says the LORD. “But I will give your life to you as a prize in all places, wherever you go.”’”"
Jeremiah,46,1,The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the nations.
Jeremiah,46,2,"Against Egypt. Concerning the army of Pharaoh Necho, king of Egypt, which was by the River Euphrates in Carchemish, and which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:"
Jeremiah,46,3,"“Order the buckler and shield, And draw near to battle!"
Jeremiah,46,4,"Harness the horses, And mount up, you horsemen! Stand forth with your helmets, Polish the spears, Put on the armor!"
Jeremiah,46,5,"Why have I seen them dismayed and turned back? Their mighty ones are beaten down; They have speedily fled, And did not look back, For fear was all around,” says the LORD."
Jeremiah,46,6,"“Do not let the swift flee away, Nor the mighty man escape; They will stumble and fall Toward the north, by the River Euphrates."
Jeremiah,46,7,"“Who is this coming up like a flood, Whose waters move like the rivers?"
Jeremiah,46,8,"Egypt rises up like a flood, And its waters move like the rivers; And he says, ‘I will go up and cover the earth, I will destroy the city and its inhabitants.’"
Jeremiah,46,9,"Come up, O horses, and rage, O chariots! And let the mighty men come forth: The Ethiopians and the Libyans who handle the shield, And the Lydians who handle and bend the bow."
Jeremiah,46,10,"For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, A day of vengeance, That He may avenge Himself on His adversaries. The sword shall devour; It shall be satiated and made drunk with their blood; For the Lord GOD of hosts has a sacrifice In the north country by the River Euphrates."
Jeremiah,46,11,"“Go up to Gilead and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt; In vain you will use many medicines; You shall not be cured."

Jeremiah,46,14,"“Declare in Egypt, and proclaim in Migdol; Proclaim in Noph and in Tahpanhes; Say, ‘Stand fast and prepare yourselves, For the sword devours all around you.’"
Jeremiah,46,15,Why are your valiant men swept away? They did not stand Because the LORD drove them away.
Jeremiah,46,16,"He made many fall; Yes, one fell upon another. And they said, ‘Arise! Let us go back to our own people And to the land of our nativity From the oppressing sword.’"

Jeremiah,46,28,"Do not fear, O Jacob My servant,” says the LORD, “For I am with you; For I will make a complete end of all the nations To which I have driven you, But I will not make a complete end of you. I will rightly correct you, For I will not leave you wholly unpunished.”"

Jeremiah,52,4,"Now it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and encamped against it; and they built a siege wall against it all around."
Jeremiah,52,5,So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
Jeremiah,52,6,"By the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the famine had become so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land."
Jeremiah,52,7,"Then the city wall was broken through, and all the men of war fled and went out of the city at night by way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden, even though the Chaldeans were near the city all around. And they went by way of the plain."
Jeremiah,52,8,"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and they overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. All his army was scattered from him."
Jeremiah,52,9,"So they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he pronounced judgment on him."
Jeremiah,52,10,Then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. And he killed all the princes of Judah in Riblah.
Jeremiah,52,11,"He also put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in bronze fetters, took him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death."
Jeremiah,52,12,"Now in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month (which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, who served the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,52,13,"He burned the house of the LORD and the king’s house; all the houses of Jerusalem, that is, all the houses of the great, he burned with fire."
Jeremiah,52,14,And all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around.
Jeremiah,52,15,"Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive some of the poor people, the rest of the people who remained in the city, the defectors who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the craftsmen."
Jeremiah,52,16,But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poor of the land as vinedressers and farmers.
Jeremiah,52,17,"The bronze pillars that were in the house of the LORD, and the carts and the bronze Sea that were in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried all their bronze to Babylon."
Jeremiah,52,18,"They also took away the pots, the shovels, the trimmers, the bowls, the spoons, and all the bronze utensils with which the priests ministered."
Jeremiah,52,19,"The basins, the firepans, the bowls, the pots, the lampstands, the spoons, and the cups, whatever was solid gold and whatever was solid silver, the captain of the guard took away."
Jeremiah,52,20,"The two pillars, one Sea, the twelve bronze bulls which were under it, and the carts, which King Solomon had made for the house of the LORD—the bronze of all these articles was beyond measure."
Jeremiah,52,21,"Now concerning the pillars: the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, a measuring line of twelve cubits could measure its circumference, and its thickness was four fingers; it was hollow."
Jeremiah,52,22,"A capital of bronze was on it; and the height of one capital was five cubits, with a network and pomegranates all around the capital, all of bronze. The second pillar, with pomegranates was the same."
Jeremiah,52,23,"There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates, all around on the network, were one hundred."
Jeremiah,52,24,"The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers."
Jeremiah,52,25,"He also took out of the city an officer who had charge of the men of war, seven men of the king’s close associates who were found in the city, the principal scribe of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the midst of the city."
Jeremiah,52,26,And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took these and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
Jeremiah,52,27,Then the king of Babylon struck them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive from its own land.
Jeremiah,52,28,"These are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews;"
Jeremiah,52,29,in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons;
Jeremiah,52,30,"in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred and forty-five persons. All the persons were four thousand six hundred."
Jeremiah,52,31,"Now it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, that Evil-Merodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison."
Jeremiah,52,32,And he spoke kindly to him and gave him a more prominent seat than those of the kings who were with him in Babylon.
Jeremiah,52,33,"So Jehoiachin changed from his prison garments, and he ate bread regularly before the king all the days of his life."
Jeremiah,52,34,"And as for his provisions, there was a regular ration given him by the king of Babylon, a portion for each day until the day of his death, all the days of his life."

Lamentations,2,3,He has cut off in fierce anger Every horn of Israel; He has drawn back His right hand From before the enemy. He has blazed against Jacob like a flaming fire Devouring all around.

Lamentations,2,7,"The Lord has spurned His altar, He has abandoned His sanctuary; He has given up the walls of her palaces Into the hand of the enemy. They have made a noise in the house of the LORD As on the day of a set feast."
Lamentations,2,8,The LORD has purposed to destroy The wall of the daughter of Zion. He has stretched out a line; He has not withdrawn His hand from destroying; Therefore He has caused the rampart and wall to lament; They languished together.
Lamentations,2,9,"Her gates have sunk into the ground; He has destroyed and broken her bars. Her king and her princes are among the nations; The Law is no more, And her prophets find no vision from the LORD."

Ezekiel,1,1,"Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the River Chebar, that the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God."
Ezekiel,1,2,"On the fifth day of the month, which was in the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s captivity,"
Ezekiel,1,3,"the word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the River Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was upon him there."
Ezekiel,1,4,"Then I looked, and behold, a whirlwind was coming out of the north, a great cloud with raging fire engulfing itself; and brightness was all around it and radiating out of its midst like the color of amber, out of the midst of the fire."
Ezekiel,1,5,Also from within it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.
Ezekiel,1,6,"Each one had four faces, and each one had four wings."
Ezekiel,1,7,"Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the soles of calves’ feet. They sparkled like the color of burnished bronze."
Ezekiel,1,8,The hands of a man were under their wings on their four sides; and each of the four had faces and wings.
Ezekiel,1,9,"Their wings touched one another. The creatures did not turn when they went, but each one went straight forward."
Ezekiel,1,10,"As for the likeness of their faces, each had the face of a man; each of the four had the face of a lion on the right side, each of the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and each of the four had the face of an eagle."
Ezekiel,1,11,"Thus were their faces. Their wings stretched upward; two wings of each one touched one another, and two covered their bodies."
Ezekiel,1,12,"And each one went straight forward; they went wherever the spirit wanted to go, and they did not turn when they went."
Ezekiel,1,13,"As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches going back and forth among the living creatures. The fire was bright, and out of the fire went lightning."
Ezekiel,1,14,"And the living creatures ran back and forth, in appearance like a flash of lightning."
Ezekiel,1,15,"Now as I looked at the living creatures, behold, a wheel was on the earth beside each living creature with its four faces."
Ezekiel,1,16,"The appearance of the wheels and their workings was like the color of beryl, and all four had the same likeness. The appearance of their workings was, as it were, a wheel in the middle of a wheel."
Ezekiel,1,17,"When they moved, they went toward any one of four directions; they did not turn aside when they went."
Ezekiel,1,18,"As for their rims, they were so high they were awesome; and their rims were full of eyes, all around the four of them."
Ezekiel,1,19,"When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up."
Ezekiel,1,20,"Wherever the spirit wanted to go, they went, because there the spirit went; and the wheels were lifted together with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels."
Ezekiel,1,21,"When those went, these went; when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up together with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels."
Ezekiel,1,22,"The likeness of the firmament above the heads of the living creatures was like the color of an awesome crystal, stretched out over their heads."
Ezekiel,1,23,"And under the firmament their wings spread out straight, one toward another. Each one had two which covered one side, and each one had two which covered the other side of the body."
Ezekiel,1,24,"When they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of many waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a tumult like the noise of an army; and when they stood still, they let down their wings."
Ezekiel,1,25,"A voice came from above the firmament that was over their heads; whenever they stood, they let down their wings."
Ezekiel,1,26,"And above the firmament over their heads was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like a sapphire stone; on the likeness of the throne was a likeness with the appearance of a man high above it."
Ezekiel,1,27,"Also from the appearance of His waist and upward I saw, as it were, the color of amber with the appearance of fire all around within it; and from the appearance of His waist and downward I saw, as it were, the appearance of fire with brightness all around."
Ezekiel,1,28,"So when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of One speaking."
Ezekiel,2,1,"And He said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak to you.”"
Ezekiel,2,2,"Then the Spirit entered me when He spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and I heard Him who spoke to me."
Ezekiel,2,3,"And He said to me: “Son of man, I am sending you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me to this very day."
Ezekiel,2,4,"For they are impudent and stubborn children. I am sending you to them, and you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD.’"
Ezekiel,2,5,"As for them, whether they hear or whether they refuse—for they are a rebellious house—yet they will know that a prophet has been among them."
Ezekiel,2,6,"“And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you and you dwell among scorpions; do not be afraid of their words or dismayed by their looks, though they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,2,7,"You shall speak My words to them, whether they hear or whether they refuse, for they are rebellious."
Ezekiel,2,8,"But you, son of man, hear what I say to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you.”"
Ezekiel,2,9,"Now when I looked, there was a hand stretched out to me; and behold, a scroll of a book was in it."
Ezekiel,2,10,"Then He spread it before me; and there was writing on the inside and on the outside, and written on it were lamentations and mourning and woe."
Ezekiel,3,1,"Moreover He said to me, “Son of man, eat what you find; eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.”"
Ezekiel,3,2,"So I opened my mouth, and He caused me to eat that scroll."
Ezekiel,3,3,"And He said to me, “Son of man, feed your belly, and fill your stomach with this scroll that I give you.” So I ate, and it was in my mouth like honey in sweetness."
Ezekiel,3,4,"Then He said to me: “Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak with My words to them."
Ezekiel,3,5,"For you are not sent to a people of unfamiliar speech and of hard language, but to the house of Israel,"
Ezekiel,3,6,"not to many people of unfamiliar speech and of hard language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, had I sent you to them, they would have listened to you."
Ezekiel,3,7,"But the house of Israel will not listen to you, because they will not listen to Me; for all the house of Israel are impudent and hard-hearted."
Ezekiel,3,8,"Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces, and your forehead strong against their foreheads."
Ezekiel,3,9,"Like adamant stone, harder than flint, I have made your forehead; do not be afraid of them, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.”"
Ezekiel,3,10,"Moreover He said to me: “Son of man, receive into your heart all My words that I speak to you, and hear with your ears."
Ezekiel,3,11,"And go, get to the captives, to the children of your people, and speak to them and tell them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD,’ whether they hear, or whether they refuse.”"
Ezekiel,3,12,"Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a great thunderous voice: “Blessed is the glory of the LORD from His place!”"
Ezekiel,3,13,"I also heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, and a great thunderous noise."
Ezekiel,3,14,"So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me."
Ezekiel,3,15,"Then I came to the captives at Tel Abib, who dwelt by the River Chebar; and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days."
Ezekiel,3,16,"Now it came to pass at the end of seven days that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,3,17,"“Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; therefore hear a word from My mouth, and give them warning from Me:"
Ezekiel,3,18,"When I say to the wicked, ‘You shall surely die,’ and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life, that same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand."
Ezekiel,3,19,"Yet, if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul."
Ezekiel,3,20,"“Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die; because you did not give him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand."
Ezekiel,3,21,"Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man that the righteous should not sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live because he took warning; also you will have delivered your soul.”"
Ezekiel,3,22,"Then the hand of the LORD was upon me there, and He said to me, “Arise, go out into the plain, and there I shall talk with you.”"
Ezekiel,3,23,"So I arose and went out into the plain, and behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, like the glory which I saw by the River Chebar; and I fell on my face."
Ezekiel,3,24,"Then the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet, and spoke with me and said to me: “Go, shut yourself inside your house."
Ezekiel,3,25,"And you, O son of man, surely they will put ropes on you and bind you with them, so that you cannot go out among them."
Ezekiel,3,26,"I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, so that you shall be mute and not be one to rebuke them, for they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,3,27,"But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD.’ He who hears, let him hear; and he who refuses, let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,4,1,"“You also, son of man, take a clay tablet and lay it before you, and portray on it a city, Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,4,2,"Lay siege against it, build a siege wall against it, and heap up a mound against it; set camps against it also, and place battering rams against it all around."
Ezekiel,4,3,"Moreover take for yourself an iron plate, and set it as an iron wall between you and the city. Set your face against it, and it shall be besieged, and you shall lay siege against it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel."
Ezekiel,4,4,"“Lie also on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it. According to the number of the days that you lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity."
Ezekiel,4,5,"For I have laid on you the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days; so you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel."
Ezekiel,4,6,"And when you have completed them, lie again on your right side; then you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days. I have laid on you a day for each year."
Ezekiel,4,7,"“Therefore you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem; your arm shall be uncovered, and you shall prophesy against it."
Ezekiel,4,8,And surely I will restrain you so that you cannot turn from one side to another till you have ended the days of your siege.
Ezekiel,4,9,"“Also take for yourself wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt; put them into one vessel, and make bread of them for yourself. During the number of days that you lie on your side, three hundred and ninety days, you shall eat it."
Ezekiel,4,10,"And your food which you eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day; from time to time you shall eat it."
Ezekiel,4,11,"You shall also drink water by measure, one-sixth of a hin; from time to time you shall drink."
Ezekiel,4,12,And you shall eat it as barley cakes; and bake it using fuel of human waste in their sight.”
Ezekiel,4,13,"Then the LORD said, “So shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, where I will drive them.”"
Ezekiel,4,14,"So I said, “Ah, Lord GOD! Indeed I have never defiled myself from my youth till now; I have never eaten what died of itself or was torn by beasts, nor has abominable flesh ever come into my mouth.”"
Ezekiel,4,15,"Then He said to me, “See, I am giving you cow dung instead of human waste, and you shall prepare your bread over it.”"
Ezekiel,4,16,"Moreover He said to me, “Son of man, surely I will cut off the supply of bread in Jerusalem; they shall eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and shall drink water by measure and with dread,"
Ezekiel,4,17,"that they may lack bread and water, and be dismayed with one another, and waste away because of their iniquity."
Ezekiel,5,1,"“And you, son of man, take a sharp sword, take it as a barber’s razor, and pass it over your head and your beard; then take scales to weigh and divide the hair."
Ezekiel,5,2,"You shall burn with fire one-third in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are finished; then you shall take one-third and strike around it with the sword, and one-third you shall scatter in the wind: I will draw out a sword after them."
Ezekiel,5,3,You shall also take a small number of them and bind them in the edge of your garment.
Ezekiel,5,4,"Then take some of them again and throw them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire. From there a fire will go out into all the house of Israel."
Ezekiel,5,5,“Thus says the Lord GOD: ‘This is Jerusalem; I have set her in the midst of the nations and the countries all around her.
Ezekiel,5,6,"She has rebelled against My judgments by doing wickedness more than the nations, and against My statutes more than the countries that are all around her; for they have refused My judgments, and they have not walked in My statutes.’"
Ezekiel,5,7,"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: ‘Because you have multiplied disobedience more than the nations that are all around you, have not walked in My statutes nor kept My judgments, nor even done according to the judgments of the nations that are all around you’—"
Ezekiel,5,8,"therefore thus says the Lord GOD: ‘Indeed I, even I, am against you and will execute judgments in your midst in the sight of the nations."
Ezekiel,5,9,"And I will do among you what I have never done, and the like of which I will never do again, because of all your abominations."
Ezekiel,5,10,"Therefore fathers shall eat their sons in your midst, and sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments among you, and all of you who remain I will scatter to all the winds."
Ezekiel,5,11,"‘Therefore, as I live,’ says the Lord GOD, ‘surely, because you have defiled My sanctuary with all your detestable things and with all your abominations, therefore I will also diminish you; My eye will not spare, nor will I have any pity."
Ezekiel,5,12,"One-third of you shall die of the pestilence, and be consumed with famine in your midst; and one-third shall fall by the sword all around you; and I will scatter another third to all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them."
Ezekiel,5,13,"‘Thus shall My anger be spent, and I will cause My fury to rest upon them, and I will be avenged; and they shall know that I, the LORD, have spoken it in My zeal, when I have spent My fury upon them."
Ezekiel,5,14,"Moreover I will make you a waste and a reproach among the nations that are all around you, in the sight of all who pass by."
Ezekiel,5,15,"‘So it shall be a reproach, a taunt, a lesson, and an astonishment to the nations that are all around you, when I execute judgments among you in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I, the LORD, have spoken."
Ezekiel,5,16,"When I send against them the terrible arrows of famine which shall be for destruction, which I will send to destroy you, I will increase the famine upon you and cut off your supply of bread."
Ezekiel,5,17,"So I will send against you famine and wild beasts, and they will bereave you. Pestilence and blood shall pass through you, and I will bring the sword against you. I, the LORD, have spoken.’”"
Ezekiel,6,1,"Now the word of the LORD came to me, saying:"
Ezekiel,6,2,"“Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,"
Ezekiel,6,3,"and say, ‘O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD! Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains, to the hills, to the ravines, and to the valleys: “Indeed I, even I, will bring a sword against you, and I will destroy your high places."
Ezekiel,6,4,"Then your altars shall be desolate, your incense altars shall be broken, and I will cast down your slain men before your idols."
Ezekiel,6,5,"And I will lay the corpses of the children of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones all around your altars."
Ezekiel,6,6,"In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate, so that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, your idols may be broken and made to cease, your incense altars may be cut down, and your works may be abolished."
Ezekiel,6,7,"The slain shall fall in your midst, and you shall know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,6,8,"“Yet I will leave a remnant, so that you may have some who escape the sword among the nations, when you are scattered through the countries."
Ezekiel,6,9,"Then those of you who escape will remember Me among the nations where they are carried captive, because I was crushed by their adulterous heart which has departed from Me, and by their eyes which play the harlot after their idols; they will loathe themselves for the evils which they committed in all their abominations."
Ezekiel,6,10,And they shall know that I am the LORD; I have not said in vain that I would bring this calamity upon them.”
Ezekiel,6,11,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Pound your fists and stamp your feet, and say, ‘Alas, for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! For they shall fall by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence."
Ezekiel,6,12,"He who is far off shall die by the pestilence, he who is near shall fall by the sword, and he who remains and is besieged shall die by the famine. Thus will I spend My fury upon them."
Ezekiel,6,13,"Then you shall know that I am the LORD, when their slain are among their idols all around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every green tree, and under every thick oak, wherever they offered sweet incense to all their idols."
Ezekiel,6,14,"So I will stretch out My hand against them and make the land desolate, yes, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblah, in all their dwelling places. Then they shall know that I am the LORD.’”’”"
Ezekiel,7,1,"Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,7,2,"“And you, son of man, thus says the Lord GOD to the land of Israel: ‘An end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land."
Ezekiel,7,3,"Now the end has come upon you, And I will send My anger against you; I will judge you according to your ways, And I will repay you for all your abominations."
Ezekiel,7,4,"My eye will not spare you, Nor will I have pity; But I will repay your ways, And your abominations will be in your midst; Then you shall know that I am the LORD!’"
Ezekiel,7,5,"“Thus says the Lord GOD: ‘A disaster, a singular disaster; Behold, it has come!"
Ezekiel,7,6,"An end has come, The end has come; It has dawned for you; Behold, it has come!"
Ezekiel,7,7,"Doom has come to you, you who dwell in the land; The time has come, A day of trouble is near, And not of rejoicing in the mountains."
Ezekiel,7,8,"Now upon you I will soon pour out My fury, And spend My anger upon you; I will judge you according to your ways, And I will repay you for all your abominations."
Ezekiel,7,9,"‘My eye will not spare, Nor will I have pity; I will repay you according to your ways, And your abominations will be in your midst. Then you shall know that I am the LORD who strikes."
Ezekiel,7,10,"‘Behold, the day! Behold, it has come! Doom has gone out; The rod has blossomed, Pride has budded."
Ezekiel,7,11,"Violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness; None of them shall remain, None of their multitude, None of them; Nor shall there be wailing for them."
Ezekiel,7,12,"The time has come, The day draws near. ‘Let not the buyer rejoice, Nor the seller mourn, For wrath is on their whole multitude."
Ezekiel,7,13,"For the seller shall not return to what has been sold, Though he may still be alive; For the vision concerns the whole multitude, And it shall not turn back; No one will strengthen himself Who lives in iniquity."
Ezekiel,7,14,"‘They have blown the trumpet and made everyone ready, But no one goes to battle; For My wrath is on all their multitude."
Ezekiel,7,15,"The sword is outside, And the pestilence and famine within. Whoever is in the field Will die by the sword; And whoever is in the city, Famine and pestilence will devour him."
Ezekiel,7,16,"‘Those who survive will escape and be on the mountains Like doves of the valleys, All of them mourning, Each for his iniquity."
Ezekiel,7,17,"Every hand will be feeble, And every knee will be as weak as water."
Ezekiel,7,18,"They will also be girded with sackcloth; Horror will cover them; Shame will be on every face, Baldness on all their heads."
Ezekiel,7,19,"‘They will throw their silver into the streets, And their gold will be like refuse; Their silver and their gold will not be able to deliver them In the day of the wrath of the LORD; They will not satisfy their souls, Nor fill their stomachs, Because it became their stumbling block of iniquity."
Ezekiel,7,20,"‘As for the beauty of his ornaments, He set it in majesty; But they made from it The images of their abominations— Their detestable things; Therefore I have made it Like refuse to them."
Ezekiel,7,21,"I will give it as plunder Into the hands of strangers, And to the wicked of the earth as spoil; And they shall defile it."
Ezekiel,7,22,"I will turn My face from them, And they will defile My secret place; For robbers shall enter it and defile it."
Ezekiel,7,23,"‘Make a chain, For the land is filled with crimes of blood, And the city is full of violence."
Ezekiel,7,24,"Therefore I will bring the worst of the Gentiles, And they will possess their houses; I will cause the pomp of the strong to cease, And their holy places shall be defiled."
Ezekiel,7,25,"Destruction comes; They will seek peace, but there shall be none."
Ezekiel,7,26,"Disaster will come upon disaster, And rumor will be upon rumor. Then they will seek a vision from a prophet; But the law will perish from the priest, And counsel from the elders."
Ezekiel,7,27,"‘The king will mourn, The prince will be clothed with desolation, And the hands of the common people will tremble. I will do to them according to their way, And according to what they deserve I will judge them; Then they shall know that I am the LORD!’”"
Ezekiel,8,1,"And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house with the elders of Judah sitting before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell upon me there."
Ezekiel,8,2,"Then I looked, and there was a likeness, like the appearance of fire—from the appearance of His waist and downward, fire; and from His waist and upward, like the appearance of brightness, like the color of amber."
Ezekiel,8,3,"He stretched out the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my hair; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the north gate of the inner court, where the seat of the image of jealousy was, which provokes to jealousy."
Ezekiel,8,4,"And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw in the plain."
Ezekiel,8,5,"Then He said to me, “Son of man, lift your eyes now toward the north.” So I lifted my eyes toward the north, and there, north of the altar gate, was this image of jealousy in the entrance."
Ezekiel,8,6,"Furthermore He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel commits here, to make Me go far away from My sanctuary? Now turn again, you will see greater abominations.”"
Ezekiel,8,7,"So He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, there was a hole in the wall."
Ezekiel,8,8,"Then He said to me, “Son of man, dig into the wall”; and when I dug into the wall, there was a door."
Ezekiel,8,9,"And He said to me, “Go in, and see the wicked abominations which they are doing there.”"
Ezekiel,8,10,"So I went in and saw, and there—every sort of creeping thing, abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed all around on the walls."
Ezekiel,8,11,"And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and in their midst stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan. Each man had a censer in his hand, and a thick cloud of incense went up."
Ezekiel,8,12,"Then He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the room of his idols? For they say, ‘The LORD does not see us, the LORD has forsaken the land.’”"
Ezekiel,8,13,"And He said to me, “Turn again, and you will see greater abominations that they are doing.”"
Ezekiel,8,14,"So He brought me to the door of the north gate of the LORD’s house; and to my dismay, women were sitting there weeping for Tammuz."
Ezekiel,8,15,"Then He said to me, “Have you seen this, O son of man? Turn again, you will see greater abominations than these.”"
Ezekiel,8,16,"So He brought me into the inner court of the LORD’s house; and there, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men with their backs toward the temple of the LORD and their faces toward the east, and they were worshiping the sun toward the east."
Ezekiel,8,17,"And He said to me, “Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it a trivial thing to the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they commit here? For they have filled the land with violence; then they have returned to provoke Me to anger. Indeed they put the branch to their nose."
Ezekiel,8,18,"Therefore I also will act in fury. My eye will not spare nor will I have pity; and though they cry in My ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.”"
Ezekiel,9,1,"Then He called out in my hearing with a loud voice, saying, “Let those who have charge over the city draw near, each with a deadly weapon in his hand.”"
Ezekiel,9,2,"And suddenly six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with his battle-ax in his hand. One man among them was clothed with linen and had a writer’s inkhorn at his side. They went in and stood beside the bronze altar."
Ezekiel,9,3,"Now the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub, where it had been, to the threshold of the temple. And He called to the man clothed with linen, who had the writer’s inkhorn at his side;"
Ezekiel,9,4,"and the LORD said to him, “Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and cry over all the abominations that are done within it.”"
Ezekiel,9,5,"To the others He said in my hearing, “Go after him through the city and kill; do not let your eye spare, nor have any pity."
Ezekiel,9,6,"Utterly slay old and young men, maidens and little children and women; but do not come near anyone on whom is the mark; and begin at My sanctuary.” So they began with the elders who were before the temple."
Ezekiel,9,7,"Then He said to them, “Defile the temple, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out!” And they went out and killed in the city."
Ezekiel,9,8,"So it was, that while they were killing them, I was left alone; and I fell on my face and cried out, and said, “Ah, Lord GOD! Will You destroy all the remnant of Israel in pouring out Your fury on Jerusalem?”"
Ezekiel,9,9,"Then He said to me, “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of bloodshed, and the city full of perversity; for they say, ‘The LORD has forsaken the land, and the LORD does not see!’"
Ezekiel,9,10,"And as for Me also, My eye will neither spare, nor will I have pity, but I will recompense their deeds on their own head.”"
Ezekiel,9,11,"Just then, the man clothed with linen, who had the inkhorn at his side, reported back and said, “I have done as You commanded me.”"
Ezekiel,10,1,"And I looked, and there in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubim, there appeared something like a sapphire stone, having the appearance of the likeness of a throne."
Ezekiel,10,2,"Then He spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, “Go in among the wheels, under the cherub, fill your hands with coals of fire from among the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.” And he went in as I watched."
Ezekiel,10,3,"Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple when the man went in, and the cloud filled the inner court."
Ezekiel,10,4,"Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and paused over the threshold of the temple; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD’s glory."
Ezekiel,10,5,"And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even in the outer court, like the voice of Almighty God when He speaks."
Ezekiel,10,6,"Then it happened, when He commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take fire from among the wheels, from among the cherubim,” that he went in and stood beside the wheels."
Ezekiel,10,7,"And the cherub stretched out his hand from among the cherubim to the fire that was among the cherubim, and took some of it and put it into the hands of the man clothed with linen, who took it and went out."
Ezekiel,10,8,The cherubim appeared to have the form of a man’s hand under their wings.
Ezekiel,10,9,"And when I looked, there were four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by one cherub and another wheel by each other cherub; the wheels appeared to have the color of a beryl stone."
Ezekiel,10,10,"As for their appearance, all four looked alike—as it were, a wheel in the middle of a wheel."
Ezekiel,10,11,"When they went, they went toward any of their four directions; they did not turn aside when they went, but followed in the direction the head was facing. They did not turn aside when they went."
Ezekiel,10,12,"And their whole body, with their back, their hands, their wings, and the wheels that the four had, were full of eyes all around."
Ezekiel,10,13,"As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, “Wheel.”"
Ezekiel,10,14,"Each one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, the second face the face of a man, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle."
Ezekiel,10,15,And the cherubim were lifted up. This was the living creature I saw by the River Chebar.
Ezekiel,10,16,"When the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also did not turn from beside them."
Ezekiel,10,17,"When the cherubim stood still, the wheels stood still, and when one was lifted up, the other lifted itself up, for the spirit of the living creature was in them."
Ezekiel,10,18,Then the glory of the LORD departed from the threshold of the temple and stood over the cherubim.
Ezekiel,10,19,"And the cherubim lifted their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight. When they went out, the wheels were beside them; and they stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD’s house, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them."
Ezekiel,10,20,"This is the living creature I saw under the God of Israel by the River Chebar, and I knew they were cherubim."
Ezekiel,10,21,"Each one had four faces and each one four wings, and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings."
Ezekiel,10,22,"And the likeness of their faces was the same as the faces which I had seen by the River Chebar, their appearance and their persons. They each went straight forward."
Ezekiel,11,1,"Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the East Gate of the LORD’s house, which faces eastward; and there at the door of the gate were twenty-five men, among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people."
Ezekiel,11,2,"And He said to me: “Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity and give wicked counsel in this city,"
Ezekiel,11,3,"who say, ‘The time is not near to build houses; this city is the caldron, and we are the meat.’"
Ezekiel,11,4,"Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man!”"
Ezekiel,11,5,"Then the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said to me, “Speak! ‘Thus says the LORD: “Thus you have said, O house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind."
Ezekiel,11,6,"You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled its streets with the slain.”"
Ezekiel,11,7,"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: “Your slain whom you have laid in its midst, they are the meat, and this city is the caldron; but I shall bring you out of the midst of it."
Ezekiel,11,8,"You have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,11,9,"“And I will bring you out of its midst, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and execute judgments on you."
Ezekiel,11,10,You shall fall by the sword. I will judge you at the border of Israel. Then you shall know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel,11,11,"This city shall not be your caldron, nor shall you be the meat in its midst. I will judge you at the border of Israel."
Ezekiel,11,12,"And you shall know that I am the LORD; for you have not walked in My statutes nor executed My judgments, but have done according to the customs of the Gentiles which are all around you.”’”"
Ezekiel,11,13,"Now it happened, while I was prophesying, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell on my face and cried with a loud voice, and said, “Ah, Lord GOD! Will You make a complete end of the remnant of Israel?”"
Ezekiel,11,14,"Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,11,15,"“Son of man, your brethren, your relatives, your countrymen, and all the house of Israel in its entirety, are those about whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, ‘Get far away from the LORD; this land has been given to us as a possession.’"
Ezekiel,11,16,"Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Although I have cast them far off among the Gentiles, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet I shall be a little sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone.”’"
Ezekiel,11,17,"Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “I will gather you from the peoples, assemble you from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.”’"
Ezekiel,11,18,"And they will go there, and they will take away all its detestable things and all its abominations from there."
Ezekiel,11,19,"Then I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within them, and take the stony heart out of their flesh, and give them a heart of flesh,"
Ezekiel,11,20,"that they may walk in My statutes and keep My judgments and do them; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God."
Ezekiel,11,21,"But as for those whose hearts follow the desire for their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their deeds on their own heads,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,11,22,"So the cherubim lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel was high above them."
Ezekiel,11,23,"And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city and stood on the mountain, which is on the east side of the city."
Ezekiel,11,24,"Then the Spirit took me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to those in captivity. And the vision that I had seen went up from me."
Ezekiel,11,25,So I spoke to those in captivity of all the things the LORD had shown me.
Ezekiel,12,1,"Now the word of the LORD came to me, saying:"
Ezekiel,12,2,"“Son of man, you dwell in the midst of a rebellious house, which has eyes to see but does not see, and ears to hear but does not hear; for they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,12,3,"“Therefore, son of man, prepare your belongings for captivity, and go into captivity by day in their sight. You shall go from your place into captivity to another place in their sight. It may be that they will consider, though they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,12,4,"By day you shall bring out your belongings in their sight, as though going into captivity; and at evening you shall go in their sight, like those who go into captivity."
Ezekiel,12,5,"Dig through the wall in their sight, and carry your belongings out through it."
Ezekiel,12,6,"In their sight you shall bear them on your shoulders and carry them out at twilight; you shall cover your face, so that you cannot see the ground, for I have made you a sign to the house of Israel.”"
Ezekiel,12,7,"So I did as I was commanded. I brought out my belongings by day, as though going into captivity, and at evening I dug through the wall with my hand. I brought them out at twilight, and I bore them on my shoulder in their sight."
Ezekiel,12,8,"And in the morning the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,12,9,"“Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, ‘What are you doing?’"
Ezekiel,12,10,"Say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “This burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are among them.”’"
Ezekiel,12,11,"Say, ‘I am a sign to you. As I have done, so shall it be done to them; they shall be carried away into captivity.’"
Ezekiel,12,12,"And the prince who is among them shall bear his belongings on his shoulder at twilight and go out. They shall dig through the wall to carry them out through it. He shall cover his face, so that he cannot see the ground with his eyes."
Ezekiel,12,13,"I will also spread My net over him, and he shall be caught in My snare. I will bring him to Babylon, to the land of the Chaldeans; yet he shall not see it, though he shall die there."
Ezekiel,12,14,"I will scatter to every wind all who are around him to help him, and all his troops; and I will draw out the sword after them."
Ezekiel,12,15,"“Then they shall know that I am the LORD, when I scatter them among the nations and disperse them throughout the countries."
Ezekiel,12,16,"But I will spare a few of their men from the sword, from famine, and from pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the Gentiles wherever they go. Then they shall know that I am the LORD.”"
Ezekiel,12,17,"Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,12,18,"“Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water with trembling and anxiety."
Ezekiel,12,19,"And say to the people of the land, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the land of Israel: “They shall eat their bread with anxiety, and drink their water with dread, so that her land may be emptied of all who are in it, because of the violence of all those who dwell in it."
Ezekiel,12,20,"Then the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall become desolate; and you shall know that I am the LORD.”’”"
Ezekiel,12,21,"And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,12,22,"“Son of man, what is this proverb that you people have about the land of Israel, which says, ‘The days are prolonged, and every vision fails’?"
Ezekiel,12,23,"Tell them therefore, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “I will lay this proverb to rest, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel.”’ But say to them, ‘“The days are at hand, and the fulfillment of every vision."
Ezekiel,12,24,For no more shall there be any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel.
Ezekiel,12,25,"For I am the LORD. I speak, and the word which I speak will come to pass; it will no more be postponed; for in your days, O rebellious house, I will say the word and perform it,” says the Lord GOD.’”"
Ezekiel,12,26,"Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,12,27,"“Son of man, look, the house of Israel is saying, ‘The vision that he sees is for many days from now, and he prophesies of times far off.’"
Ezekiel,12,28,"Therefore say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “None of My words will be postponed any more, but the word which I speak will be done,” says the Lord GOD.’”"
Ezekiel,13,1,"And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,13,2,"“Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy out of their own heart, ‘Hear the word of the LORD!’”"
Ezekiel,13,3,"Thus says the Lord GOD: “Woe to the foolish prophets, who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing!"
Ezekiel,13,4,"O Israel, your prophets are like foxes in the deserts."
Ezekiel,13,5,You have not gone up into the gaps to build a wall for the house of Israel to stand in battle on the day of the LORD.
Ezekiel,13,6,"They have envisioned futility and false divination, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD!’ But the LORD has not sent them; yet they hope that the word may be confirmed."
Ezekiel,13,7,"Have you not seen a futile vision, and have you not spoken false divination? You say, ‘The LORD says,’ but I have not spoken.”"
Ezekiel,13,8,"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: “Because you have spoken nonsense and envisioned lies, therefore I am indeed against you,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,13,9,"“My hand will be against the prophets who envision futility and who divine lies; they shall not be in the assembly of My people, nor be written in the record of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter into the land of Israel. Then you shall know that I am the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,13,10,"“Because, indeed, because they have seduced My people, saying, ‘Peace!’ when there is no peace—and one builds a wall, and they plaster it with untempered mortar—"
Ezekiel,13,11,"say to those who plaster it with untempered mortar, that it will fall. There will be flooding rain, and you, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall tear it down."
Ezekiel,13,12,"Surely, when the wall has fallen, will it not be said to you, ‘Where is the mortar with which you plastered it?’”"
Ezekiel,13,13,"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: “I will cause a stormy wind to break forth in My fury; and there shall be a flooding rain in My anger, and great hailstones in fury to consume it."
Ezekiel,13,14,"So I will break down the wall you have plastered with untempered mortar, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be uncovered; it will fall, and you shall be consumed in the midst of it. Then you shall know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,13,15,"“Thus will I accomplish My wrath on the wall and on those who have plastered it with untempered mortar; and I will say to you, ‘The wall is no more, nor those who plastered it,"
Ezekiel,13,16,"that is, the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her when there is no peace,’” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,13,17,"“Likewise, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own heart; prophesy against them,"
Ezekiel,13,18,"and say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Woe to the women who sew magic charms on their sleeves and make veils for the heads of people of every height to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of My people, and keep yourselves alive?"
Ezekiel,13,19,"And will you profane Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, killing people who should not die, and keeping people alive who should not live, by your lying to My people who listen to lies?”"
Ezekiel,13,20,"‘Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: “Behold, I am against your magic charms by which you hunt souls there like birds. I will tear them from your arms, and let the souls go, the souls you hunt like birds."
Ezekiel,13,21,"I will also tear off your veils and deliver My people out of your hand, and they shall no longer be as prey in your hand. Then you shall know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,13,22,"“Because with lies you have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and you have strengthened the hands of the wicked, so that he does not turn from his wicked way to save his life."
Ezekiel,13,23,"Therefore you shall no longer envision futility nor practice divination; for I will deliver My people out of your hand, and you shall know that I am the LORD.”’”"
Ezekiel,14,1,Now some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat before me.
Ezekiel,14,2,"And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,14,3,"“Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their hearts, and put before them that which causes them to stumble into iniquity. Should I let Myself be inquired of at all by them?"
Ezekiel,14,4,"“Therefore speak to them, and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Everyone of the house of Israel who sets up his idols in his heart, and puts before him what causes him to stumble into iniquity, and then comes to the prophet, I the LORD will answer him who comes, according to the multitude of his idols,"
Ezekiel,14,5,"that I may seize the house of Israel by their heart, because they are all estranged from Me by their idols.”’"
Ezekiel,14,6,"“Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Repent, turn away from your idols, and turn your faces away from all your abominations."
Ezekiel,14,7,"For anyone of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who dwell in Israel, who separates himself from Me and sets up his idols in his heart and puts before him what causes him to stumble into iniquity, then comes to a prophet to inquire of him concerning Me, I the LORD will answer him by Myself."
Ezekiel,14,8,"I will set My face against that man and make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of My people. Then you shall know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,14,9,"“And if the prophet is induced to speak anything, I the LORD have induced that prophet, and I will stretch out My hand against him and destroy him from among My people Israel."
Ezekiel,14,10,"And they shall bear their iniquity; the punishment of the prophet shall be the same as the punishment of the one who inquired,"
Ezekiel,14,11,"that the house of Israel may no longer stray from Me, nor be profaned anymore with all their transgressions, but that they may be My people and I may be their God,“ says the Lord GOD.’”"
Ezekiel,14,12,"The word of the LORD came again to me, saying:"
Ezekiel,14,13,"“Son of man, when a land sins against Me by persistent unfaithfulness, I will stretch out My hand against it; I will cut off its supply of bread, send famine on it, and cut off man and beast from it."
Ezekiel,14,14,"Even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver only themselves by their righteousness,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,14,15,"“If I cause wild beasts to pass through the land, and they empty it, and make it so desolate that no man may pass through because of the beasts,"
Ezekiel,14,16,"even though these three men were in it, as I live,” says the Lord GOD, “they would deliver neither sons nor daughters; only they would be delivered, and the land would be desolate."
Ezekiel,14,17,"“Or if I bring a sword on that land, and say, ‘Sword, go through the land,’ and I cut off man and beast from it,"
Ezekiel,14,18,"even though these three men were in it, as I live,” says the Lord GOD, “they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, but only they themselves would be delivered."
Ezekiel,14,19,"“Or if I send a pestilence into that land and pour out My fury on it in blood, and cut off from it man and beast,"
Ezekiel,14,20,"even though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live,” says the Lord GOD, “they would deliver neither son nor daughter; they would deliver only themselves by their righteousness.”"
Ezekiel,14,21,For thus says the Lord GOD: “How much more it shall be when I send My four severe judgments on Jerusalem—the sword and famine and wild beasts and pestilence—to cut off man and beast from it?
Ezekiel,14,22,"Yet behold, there shall be left in it a remnant who will be brought out, both sons and daughters; surely they will come out to you, and you will see their ways and their doings. Then you will be comforted concerning the disaster that I have brought upon Jerusalem, all that I have brought upon it."
Ezekiel,14,23,"And they will comfort you, when you see their ways and their doings; and you shall know that I have done nothing without cause that I have done in it,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,15,1,"Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying:"
Ezekiel,15,2,"“Son of man, how is the wood of the vine better than any other wood, the vine branch which is among the trees of the forest?"
Ezekiel,15,3,Is wood taken from it to make any object? Or can men make a peg from it to hang any vessel on?
Ezekiel,15,4,"Instead, it is thrown into the fire for fuel; the fire devours both ends of it, and its middle is burned. Is it useful for any work?"
Ezekiel,15,5,"Indeed, when it was whole, no object could be made from it. How much less will it be useful for any work when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned?"
Ezekiel,15,6,"“Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: ‘Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give up the inhabitants of Jerusalem;"
Ezekiel,15,7,"and I will set My face against them. They will go out from one fire, but another fire shall devour them. Then you shall know that I am the LORD, when I set My face against them."
Ezekiel,15,8,"Thus I will make the land desolate, because they have persisted in unfaithfulness,’ says the Lord GOD.”"
Ezekiel,16,1,"Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,16,2,"“Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,"
Ezekiel,16,3,"and say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD to Jerusalem: “Your birth and your nativity are from the land of Canaan; your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite."
Ezekiel,16,4,"As for your nativity, on the day you were born your navel cord was not cut, nor were you washed in water to cleanse you; you were not rubbed with salt nor wrapped in swaddling cloths."
Ezekiel,16,5,"No eye pitied you, to do any of these things for you, to have compassion on you; but you were thrown out into the open field, when you yourself were loathed on the day you were born."
Ezekiel,16,6,"“And when I passed by you and saw you struggling in your own blood, I said to you in your blood, ‘Live!’ Yes, I said to you in your blood, ‘Live!’"
Ezekiel,16,7,"I made you thrive like a plant in the field; and you grew, matured, and became very beautiful. Your breasts were formed, your hair grew, but you were naked and bare."
Ezekiel,16,8,"“When I passed by you again and looked upon you, indeed your time was the time of love; so I spread My wing over you and covered your nakedness. Yes, I swore an oath to you and entered into a covenant with you, and you became Mine,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,16,9,"“Then I washed you in water; yes, I thoroughly washed off your blood, and I anointed you with oil."
Ezekiel,16,10,I clothed you in embroidered cloth and gave you sandals of badger skin; I clothed you with fine linen and covered you with silk.
Ezekiel,16,11,"I adorned you with ornaments, put bracelets on your wrists, and a chain on your neck."
Ezekiel,16,12,"And I put a jewel in your nose, earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head."
Ezekiel,16,13,"Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing was of fine linen, silk, and embroidered cloth. You ate pastry of fine flour, honey, and oil. You were exceedingly beautiful, and succeeded to royalty."
Ezekiel,16,14,"Your fame went out among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect through My splendor which I had bestowed on you,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,16,15,"“But you trusted in your own beauty, played the harlot because of your fame, and poured out your harlotry on everyone passing by who would have it."
Ezekiel,16,16,"You took some of your garments and adorned multicolored high places for yourself, and played the harlot on them. Such things should not happen, nor be."
Ezekiel,16,17,"You have also taken your beautiful jewelry from My gold and My silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself male images and played the harlot with them."
Ezekiel,16,18,"You took your embroidered garments and covered them, and you set My oil and My incense before them."
Ezekiel,16,19,"Also My food which I gave you—the pastry of fine flour, oil, and honey which I fed you—you set it before them as sweet incense; and so it was,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,16,20,"“Moreover you took your sons and your daughters, whom you bore to Me, and these you sacrificed to them to be devoured. Were your acts of harlotry a small matter,"
Ezekiel,16,21,that you have slain My children and offered them up to them by causing them to pass through the fire?
Ezekiel,16,22,"And in all your abominations and acts of harlotry you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, struggling in your blood."
Ezekiel,16,23,"“Then it was so, after all your wickedness—‘Woe, woe to you!’ says the Lord GOD—"
Ezekiel,16,24,"that you also built for yourself a shrine, and made a high place for yourself in every street."
Ezekiel,16,25,"You built your high places at the head of every road, and made your beauty to be abhorred. You offered yourself to everyone who passed by, and multiplied your acts of harlotry."
Ezekiel,16,26,"You also committed harlotry with the Egyptians, your very fleshly neighbors, and increased your acts of harlotry to provoke Me to anger."
Ezekiel,16,27,"“Behold, therefore, I stretched out My hand against you, diminished your allotment, and gave you up to the will of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your lewd behavior."
Ezekiel,16,28,"You also played the harlot with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; indeed you played the harlot with them and still were not satisfied."
Ezekiel,16,29,"Moreover you multiplied your acts of harlotry as far as the land of the trader, Chaldea; and even then you were not satisfied."
Ezekiel,16,30,"“How degenerate is your heart!” says the Lord GOD, “seeing you do all these things, the deeds of a brazen harlot."
Ezekiel,16,31,"“You erected your shrine at the head of every road, and built your high place in every street. Yet you were not like a harlot, because you scorned payment."
Ezekiel,16,32,"You are an adulterous wife, who takes strangers instead of her husband."
Ezekiel,16,33,"Men make payment to all harlots, but you made your payments to all your lovers, and hired them to come to you from all around for your harlotry."
Ezekiel,16,34,"You are the opposite of other women in your harlotry, because no one solicited you to be a harlot. In that you gave payment but no payment was given you, therefore you are the opposite.”"
Ezekiel,16,35,"‘Now then, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD!"
Ezekiel,16,36,"Thus says the Lord GOD: “Because your filthiness was poured out and your nakedness uncovered in your harlotry with your lovers, and with all your abominable idols, and because of the blood of your children which you gave to them,"
Ezekiel,16,37,"surely, therefore, I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved, and all those you hated; I will gather them from all around against you and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness."
Ezekiel,16,38,And I will judge you as women who break wedlock or shed blood are judged; I will bring blood upon you in fury and jealousy.
Ezekiel,16,39,"I will also give you into their hand, and they shall throw down your shrines and break down your high places. They shall also strip you of your clothes, take your beautiful jewelry, and leave you naked and bare."
Ezekiel,16,40,"“They shall also bring up an assembly against you, and they shall stone you with stones and thrust you through with their swords."
Ezekiel,16,41,"They shall burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women; and I will make you cease playing the harlot, and you shall no longer hire lovers."
Ezekiel,16,42,"So I will lay to rest My fury toward you, and My jealousy shall depart from you. I will be quiet, and be angry no more."
Ezekiel,16,43,"Because you did not remember the days of your youth, but agitated Me with all these things, surely I will also recompense your deeds on your own head,” says the Lord GOD. “And you shall not commit lewdness in addition to all your abominations."
Ezekiel,16,44,"“Indeed everyone who quotes proverbs will use this proverb against you: ‘Like mother, like daughter!’"
Ezekiel,16,45,"You are your mother’s daughter, loathing husband and children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and children; your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite."
Ezekiel,16,46,"“Your elder sister is Samaria, who dwells with her daughters to the north of you; and your younger sister, who dwells to the south of you, is Sodom and her daughters."
Ezekiel,16,47,"You did not walk in their ways nor act according to their abominations; but, as if that were too little, you became more corrupt than they in all your ways."
Ezekiel,16,48,"“As I live,” says the Lord GOD, “neither your sister Sodom nor her daughters have done as you and your daughters have done."
Ezekiel,16,49,"Look, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: She and her daughter had pride, fullness of food, and abundance of idleness; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy."
Ezekiel,16,50,And they were haughty and committed abomination before Me; therefore I took them away as I saw fit.
Ezekiel,16,51,"“Samaria did not commit half of your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters by all the abominations which you have done."
Ezekiel,16,52,"You who judged your sisters, bear your own shame also, because the sins which you committed were more abominable than theirs; they are more righteous than you. Yes, be disgraced also, and bear your own shame, because you justified your sisters."
Ezekiel,16,53,"“When I bring back their captives, the captives of Sodom and her daughters, and the captives of Samaria and her daughters, then I will also bring back the captives of your captivity among them,"
Ezekiel,16,54,that you may bear your own shame and be disgraced by all that you did when you comforted them.
Ezekiel,16,55,"When your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters return to their former state, then you and your daughters will return to your former state."
Ezekiel,16,56,"For your sister Sodom was not a byword in your mouth in the days of your pride,"
Ezekiel,16,57,"before your wickedness was uncovered. It was like the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria and all those around her, and of the daughters of the Philistines, who despise you everywhere."
Ezekiel,16,58,"You have paid for your lewdness and your abominations,” says the LORD."
Ezekiel,16,59,"For thus says the Lord GOD: “I will deal with you as you have done, who despised the oath by breaking the covenant."
Ezekiel,16,60,"“Nevertheless I will remember My covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you."
Ezekiel,16,61,"Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed, when you receive your older and your younger sisters; for I will give them to you for daughters, but not because of My covenant with you."
Ezekiel,16,62,"And I will establish My covenant with you. Then you shall know that I am the LORD,"
Ezekiel,16,63,"that you may remember and be ashamed, and never open your mouth anymore because of your shame, when I provide you an atonement for all you have done,” says the Lord GOD.’”"
Ezekiel,17,1,"And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,17,2,"“Son of man, pose a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel,"
Ezekiel,17,3,"and say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “A great eagle with large wings and long pinions, Full of feathers of various colors, Came to Lebanon And took from the cedar the highest branch."
Ezekiel,17,4,He cropped off its topmost young twig And carried it to a land of trade; He set it in a city of merchants.
Ezekiel,17,5,Then he took some of the seed of the land And planted it in a fertile field; He placed it by abundant waters And set it like a willow tree.
Ezekiel,17,6,"And it grew and became a spreading vine of low stature; Its branches turned toward him, But its roots were under it. So it became a vine, Brought forth branches, And put forth shoots."
Ezekiel,17,7,"“But there was another great eagle with large wings and many feathers; And behold, this vine bent its roots toward him, And stretched its branches toward him, From the garden terrace where it had been planted, That he might water it."
Ezekiel,17,8,"It was planted in good soil by many waters, To bring forth branches, bear fruit, And become a majestic vine.”’"
Ezekiel,17,9,"“Say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Will it thrive? Will he not pull up its roots, Cut off its fruit, And leave it to wither? All of its spring leaves will wither, And no great power or many people Will be needed to pluck it up by its roots."
Ezekiel,17,10,"Behold, it is planted, Will it thrive? Will it not utterly wither when the east wind touches it? It will wither in the garden terrace where it grew.”’”"
Ezekiel,17,11,"Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,17,12,"“Say now to the rebellious house: ‘Do you not know what these things mean?’ Tell them, ‘Indeed the king of Babylon went to Jerusalem and took its king and princes, and led them with him to Babylon."
Ezekiel,17,13,"And he took the king’s offspring, made a covenant with him, and put him under oath. He also took away the mighty of the land,"
Ezekiel,17,14,"that the kingdom might be brought low and not lift itself up, but that by keeping his covenant it might stand."
Ezekiel,17,15,"But he rebelled against him by sending his ambassadors to Egypt, that they might give him horses and many people. Will he prosper? Will he who does such things escape? Can he break a covenant and still be delivered?"
Ezekiel,17,16,"‘As I live,’ says the Lord GOD, ‘surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke—with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die."
Ezekiel,17,17,"Nor will Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company do anything in the war, when they heap up a siege mound and build a wall to cut off many persons."
Ezekiel,17,18,"Since he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, and in fact gave his hand and still did all these things, he shall not escape.’”"
Ezekiel,17,19,"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: “As I live, surely My oath which he despised, and My covenant which he broke, I will recompense on his own head."
Ezekiel,17,20,"I will spread My net over him, and he shall be taken in My snare. I will bring him to Babylon and try him there for the treason which he committed against Me."
Ezekiel,17,21,"All his fugitives with all his troops shall fall by the sword, and those who remain shall be scattered to every wind; and you shall know that I, the LORD, have spoken.”"
Ezekiel,17,22,"Thus says the Lord GOD: “I will take also one of the highest branches of the high cedar and set it out. I will crop off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and will plant it on a high and prominent mountain."
Ezekiel,17,23,"On the mountain height of Israel I will plant it; and it will bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a majestic cedar. Under it will dwell birds of every sort; in the shadow of its branches they will dwell."
Ezekiel,17,24,"And all the trees of the field shall know that I, the LORD, have brought down the high tree and exalted the low tree, dried up the green tree and made the dry tree flourish; I, the LORD, have spoken and have done it.”"
Ezekiel,18,1,"The word of the LORD came to me again, saying,"
Ezekiel,18,2,"“What do you mean when you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying: ‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes, And the children’s teeth are set on edge’?"
Ezekiel,18,3,"“As I live,” says the Lord GOD, “you shall no longer use this proverb in Israel."
Ezekiel,18,4,"“Behold, all souls are Mine; The soul of the father As well as the soul of the son is Mine; The soul who sins shall die."
Ezekiel,18,5,But if a man is just And does what is lawful and right;
Ezekiel,18,6,"If he has not eaten on the mountains, Nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, Nor defiled his neighbor’s wife, Nor approached a woman during her impurity;"
Ezekiel,18,7,"If he has not oppressed anyone, But has restored to the debtor his pledge; Has robbed no one by violence, But has given his bread to the hungry And covered the naked with clothing;"
Ezekiel,18,8,"If he has not exacted usury Nor taken any increase, But has withdrawn his hand from iniquity And executed true judgment between man and man;"
Ezekiel,18,9,If he has walked in My statutes And kept My judgments faithfully— He is just; He shall surely live!” Says the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel,18,10,"“If he begets a son who is a robber Or a shedder of blood, Who does any of these things"
Ezekiel,18,11,"And does none of those duties, But has eaten on the mountains Or defiled his neighbor’s wife;"
Ezekiel,18,12,"If he has oppressed the poor and needy, Robbed by violence, Not restored the pledge, Lifted his eyes to the idols, Or committed abomination;"
Ezekiel,18,13,"If he has exacted usury Or taken increase— Shall he then live? He shall not live! If he has done any of these abominations, He shall surely die; His blood shall be upon him."
Ezekiel,18,14,"“If, however, he begets a son Who sees all the sins which his father has done, And considers but does not do likewise;"
Ezekiel,18,15,"Who has not eaten on the mountains, Nor lifted his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, Nor defiled his neighbor’s wife;"
Ezekiel,18,16,"Has not oppressed anyone, Nor withheld a pledge, Nor robbed by violence, But has given his bread to the hungry And covered the naked with clothing;"
Ezekiel,18,17,"Who has withdrawn his hand from the poor And not received usury or increase, But has executed My judgments And walked in My statutes— He shall not die for the iniquity of his father; He shall surely live!"
Ezekiel,18,18,"“As for his father, Because he cruelly oppressed, Robbed his brother by violence, And did what is not good among his people, Behold, he shall die for his iniquity."
Ezekiel,18,19,"“Yet you say, ‘Why should the son not bear the guilt of the father?’ Because the son has done what is lawful and right, and has kept all My statutes and observed them, he shall surely live."
Ezekiel,18,20,"The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not bear the guilt of the father, nor the father bear the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself."
Ezekiel,18,21,"“But if a wicked man turns from all his sins which he has committed, keeps all My statutes, and does what is lawful and right, he shall surely live; he shall not die."
Ezekiel,18,22,"None of the transgressions which he has committed shall be remembered against him; because of the righteousness which he has done, he shall live."
Ezekiel,18,23,"Do I have any pleasure at all that the wicked should die?” says the Lord GOD, “and not that he should turn from his ways and live?"
Ezekiel,18,24,"“But when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that the wicked man does, shall he live? All the righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; because of the unfaithfulness of which he is guilty and the sin which he has committed, because of them he shall die."
Ezekiel,18,25,"“Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair.’ Hear now, O house of Israel, is it not My way which is fair, and your ways which are not fair?"
Ezekiel,18,26,"When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, commits iniquity, and dies in it, it is because of the iniquity which he has done that he dies."
Ezekiel,18,27,"Again, when a wicked man turns away from the wickedness which he committed, and does what is lawful and right, he preserves himself alive."
Ezekiel,18,28,"Because he considers and turns away from all the transgressions which he committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die."
Ezekiel,18,29,"Yet the house of Israel says, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair.’ O house of Israel, is it not My ways which are fair, and your ways which are not fair?"
Ezekiel,18,30,"“Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways,” says the Lord GOD. “Repent, and turn from all your transgressions, so that iniquity will not be your ruin."
Ezekiel,18,31,"Cast away from you all the transgressions which you have committed, and get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. For why should you die, O house of Israel?"
Ezekiel,18,32,"For I have no pleasure in the death of one who dies,” says the Lord GOD. “Therefore turn and live!”"
Ezekiel,19,1,"“Moreover take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,"
Ezekiel,19,2,and say: ‘What is your mother? A lioness: She lay down among the lions; Among the young lions she nourished her cubs.
Ezekiel,19,3,"She brought up one of her cubs, And he became a young lion; He learned to catch prey, And he devoured men."
Ezekiel,19,4,"The nations also heard of him; He was trapped in their pit, And they brought him with chains to the land of Egypt."
Ezekiel,19,5,"‘When she saw that she waited, that her hope was lost, She took another of her cubs and made him a young lion."
Ezekiel,19,6,"He roved among the lions, And became a young lion; He learned to catch prey; He devoured men."
Ezekiel,19,7,"He knew their desolate places, And laid waste their cities; The land with its fullness was desolated By the noise of his roaring."
Ezekiel,19,8,"Then the nations set against him from the provinces on every side, And spread their net over him; He was trapped in their pit."
Ezekiel,19,9,"They put him in a cage with chains, And brought him to the king of Babylon; They brought him in nets, That his voice should no longer be heard on the mountains of Israel."
Ezekiel,19,10,"‘Your mother was like a vine in your bloodline, Planted by the waters, Fruitful and full of branches Because of many waters."
Ezekiel,19,11,"She had strong branches for scepters of rulers. She towered in stature above the thick branches, And was seen in her height amid the dense foliage."
Ezekiel,19,12,"But she was plucked up in fury, She was cast down to the ground, And the east wind dried her fruit. Her strong branches were broken and withered; The fire consumed them."
Ezekiel,19,13,"And now she is planted in the wilderness, In a dry and thirsty land."
Ezekiel,19,14,"Fire has come out from a rod of her branches And devoured her fruit, So that she has no strong branch— a scepter for ruling.’” This is a lamentation, and has become a lamentation."
Ezekiel,20,1,"It came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and sat before me."
Ezekiel,20,2,"Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,20,3,"“Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Have you come to inquire of Me? As I live,” says the Lord GOD, “I will not be inquired of by you.”’"
Ezekiel,20,4,"Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? Then make known to them the abominations of their fathers."
Ezekiel,20,5,"“Say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “On the day when I chose Israel and raised My hand in an oath to the descendants of the house of Jacob, and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt, I raised My hand in an oath to them, saying, ‘I am the LORD your God.’"
Ezekiel,20,6,"On that day I raised My hand in an oath to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, ‘flowing with milk and honey,’ the glory of all lands."
Ezekiel,20,7,"Then I said to them, ‘Each of you, throw away the abominations which are before his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.’"
Ezekiel,20,8,"But they rebelled against Me and would not obey Me. They did not all cast away the abominations which were before their eyes, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said, ‘I will pour out My fury on them and fulfill My anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.’"
Ezekiel,20,9,"But I acted for My name’s sake, that it should not be profaned before the Gentiles among whom they were, in whose sight I had made Myself known to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt."
Ezekiel,20,10,“Therefore I made them go out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.
Ezekiel,20,11,"And I gave them My statutes and showed them My judgments, ‘which, if a man does, he shall live by them.’"
Ezekiel,20,12,"Moreover I also gave them My Sabbaths, to be a sign between them and Me, that they might know that I am the LORD who sanctifies them."
Ezekiel,20,13,"Yet the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness; they did not walk in My statutes; they despised My judgments, ‘which, if a man does, he shall live by them’; and they greatly defiled My Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out My fury on them in the wilderness, to consume them."
Ezekiel,20,14,"But I acted for My name’s sake, that it should not be profaned before the Gentiles, in whose sight I had brought them out."
Ezekiel,20,15,"So I also raised My hand in an oath to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, ‘flowing with milk and honey,’ the glory of all lands,"
Ezekiel,20,16,"because they despised My judgments and did not walk in My statutes, but profaned My Sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols."
Ezekiel,20,17,Nevertheless My eye spared them from destruction. I did not make an end of them in the wilderness.
Ezekiel,20,18,"“But I said to their children in the wilderness, ‘Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, nor observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols."
Ezekiel,20,19,"I am the LORD your God: Walk in My statutes, keep My judgments, and do them;"
Ezekiel,20,20,"hallow My Sabbaths, and they will be a sign between Me and you, that you may know that I am the LORD your God.’"
Ezekiel,20,21,"“Notwithstanding, the children rebelled against Me; they did not walk in My statutes, and were not careful to observe My judgments, ‘which, if a man does, he shall live by them’; but they profaned My Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out My fury on them and fulfill My anger against them in the wilderness."
Ezekiel,20,22,"Nevertheless I withdrew My hand and acted for My name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the Gentiles, in whose sight I had brought them out."
Ezekiel,20,23,"Also I raised My hand in an oath to those in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the Gentiles and disperse them throughout the countries,"
Ezekiel,20,24,"because they had not executed My judgments, but had despised My statutes, profaned My Sabbaths, and their eyes were fixed on their fathers’ idols."
Ezekiel,20,25,"“Therefore I also gave them up to statutes that were not good, and judgments by which they could not live;"
Ezekiel,20,26,"and I pronounced them unclean because of their ritual gifts, in that they caused all their firstborn to pass through the fire, that I might make them desolate and that they might know that I am the LORD.”’"
Ezekiel,20,27,"“Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “In this too your fathers have blasphemed Me, by being unfaithful to Me."
Ezekiel,20,28,"When I brought them into the land concerning which I had raised My hand in an oath to give them, and they saw all the high hills and all the thick trees, there they offered their sacrifices and provoked Me with their offerings. There they also sent up their sweet aroma and poured out their drink offerings."
Ezekiel,20,29,"Then I said to them, ‘What is this high place to which you go?’ So its name is called Bamah to this day.”’"
Ezekiel,20,30,"Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Are you defiling yourselves in the manner of your fathers, and committing harlotry according to their abominations?"
Ezekiel,20,31,"For when you offer your gifts and make your sons pass through the fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols, even to this day. So shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live,” says the Lord GOD, “I will not be inquired of by you."
Ezekiel,20,32,"What you have in your mind shall never be, when you say, ‘We will be like the Gentiles, like the families in other countries, serving wood and stone.’"
Ezekiel,20,33,"“As I live,” says the Lord GOD, “surely with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out, I will rule over you."
Ezekiel,20,34,"I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you are scattered, with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out."
Ezekiel,20,35,"And I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will plead My case with you face to face."
Ezekiel,20,36,"Just as I pleaded My case with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will plead My case with you,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,20,37,"“I will make you pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant;"
Ezekiel,20,38,"I will purge the rebels from among you, and those who transgress against Me; I will bring them out of the country where they dwell, but they shall not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,20,39,"“As for you, O house of Israel,” thus says the Lord GOD: “Go, serve every one of you his idols—and hereafter—if you will not obey Me; but profane My holy name no more with your gifts and your idols."
Ezekiel,20,40,"For on My holy mountain, on the mountain height of Israel,” says the Lord GOD, “there all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, shall serve Me; there I will accept them, and there I will require your offerings and the firstfruits of your sacrifices, together with all your holy things."
Ezekiel,20,41,I will accept you as a sweet aroma when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you have been scattered; and I will be hallowed in you before the Gentiles.
Ezekiel,20,42,"Then you shall know that I am the LORD, when I bring you into the land of Israel, into the country for which I raised My hand in an oath to give to your fathers."
Ezekiel,20,43,And there you shall remember your ways and all your doings with which you were defiled; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight because of all the evils that you have committed.
Ezekiel,20,44,"Then you shall know that I am the LORD, when I have dealt with you for My name’s sake, not according to your wicked ways nor according to your corrupt doings, O house of Israel,” says the Lord GOD.’”"
Ezekiel,20,45,"Furthermore the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,20,46,"“Son of man, set your face toward the south; preach against the south and prophesy against the forest land, the South,"
Ezekiel,20,47,"and say to the forest of the South, ‘Hear the word of the LORD! Thus says the Lord GOD: “Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree and every dry tree in you; the blazing flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be scorched by it."
Ezekiel,20,48,"All flesh shall see that I, the LORD, have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.”’”"
Ezekiel,20,49,"Then I said, “Ah, Lord GOD! They say of me, ‘Does he not speak parables?’”"
Ezekiel,21,1,"And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,21,2,"“Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, preach against the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel;"
Ezekiel,21,3,"and say to the land of Israel, ‘Thus says the LORD: “Behold, I am against you, and I will draw My sword out of its sheath and cut off both righteous and wicked from you."
Ezekiel,21,4,"Because I will cut off both righteous and wicked from you, therefore My sword shall go out of its sheath against all flesh from south to north,"
Ezekiel,21,5,"that all flesh may know that I, the LORD, have drawn My sword out of its sheath; it shall not return anymore.”’"
Ezekiel,21,6,"Sigh therefore, son of man, with a breaking heart, and sigh with bitterness before their eyes."
Ezekiel,21,7,"And it shall be when they say to you, ‘Why are you sighing?’ that you shall answer, ‘Because of the news; when it comes, every heart will melt, all hands will be feeble, every spirit will faint, and all knees will be weak as water. Behold, it is coming and shall be brought to pass,’ says the Lord GOD.”"
Ezekiel,21,8,"Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,21,9,"“Son of man, prophesy and say, ‘Thus says the LORD!’ Say: ‘A sword, a sword is sharpened And also polished!"
Ezekiel,21,10,"Sharpened to make a dreadful slaughter, Polished to flash like lightning! Should we then make mirth? It despises the scepter of My son, As it does all wood."
Ezekiel,21,11,"And He has given it to be polished, That it may be handled; This sword is sharpened, and it is polished To be given into the hand of the slayer.’"
Ezekiel,21,12,"“Cry and wail, son of man; For it will be against My people, Against all the princes of Israel. Terrors including the sword will be against My people; Therefore strike your thigh."
Ezekiel,21,13,"“Because it is a testing, And what if the sword despises even the scepter? The scepter shall be no more,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,21,14,"“You therefore, son of man, prophesy, And strike your hands together. The third time let the sword do double damage. It is the sword that slays, The sword that slays the great men, That enters their private chambers."
Ezekiel,21,15,"I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, That the heart may melt and many may stumble. Ah! It is made bright; It is grasped for slaughter:"
Ezekiel,21,16,“Swords at the ready! Thrust right! Set your blade! Thrust left— Wherever your edge is ordered!
Ezekiel,21,17,"“I also will beat My fists together, And I will cause My fury to rest; I, the LORD, have spoken.”"
Ezekiel,21,18,"The word of the LORD came to me again, saying:"
Ezekiel,21,19,"“And son of man, appoint for yourself two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to go; both of them shall go from the same land. Make a sign; put it at the head of the road to the city."
Ezekiel,21,20,"Appoint a road for the sword to go to Rabbah of the Ammonites, and to Judah, into fortified Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,21,21,"For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the road, at the fork of the two roads, to use divination: he shakes the arrows, he consults the images, he looks at the liver."
Ezekiel,21,22,"In his right hand is the divination for Jerusalem: to set up battering rams, to call for a slaughter, to lift the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to heap up a siege mound, and to build a wall."
Ezekiel,21,23,"And it will be to them like a false divination in the eyes of those who have sworn oaths with them; but he will bring their iniquity to remembrance, that they may be taken."
Ezekiel,21,24,"“Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: ‘Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins appear—because you have come to remembrance, you shall be taken in hand."
Ezekiel,21,25,"‘Now to you, O profane, wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come, whose iniquity shall end,"
Ezekiel,21,26,"thus says the Lord GOD: “Remove the turban, and take off the crown; Nothing shall remain the same. Exalt the humble, and humble the exalted."
Ezekiel,21,27,"Overthrown, overthrown, I will make it overthrown! It shall be no longer, Until He comes whose right it is, And I will give it to Him.”’"
Ezekiel,21,28,"“And you, son of man, prophesy and say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites and concerning their reproach,’ and say: ‘A sword, a sword is drawn, Polished for slaughter, For consuming, for flashing—"
Ezekiel,21,29,"While they see false visions for you, While they divine a lie to you, To bring you on the necks of the wicked, the slain Whose day has come, Whose iniquity shall end."
Ezekiel,21,30,"‘Return it to its sheath. I will judge you In the place where you were created, In the land of your nativity."
Ezekiel,21,31,"I will pour out My indignation on you; I will blow against you with the fire of My wrath, And deliver you into the hands of brutal men who are skillful to destroy."
Ezekiel,21,32,"You shall be fuel for the fire; Your blood shall be in the midst of the land. You shall not be remembered, For I the LORD have spoken.’”"
Ezekiel,22,1,"Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,22,2,"“Now, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? Yes, show her all her abominations!"
Ezekiel,22,3,"Then say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “The city sheds blood in her own midst, that her time may come; and she makes idols within herself to defile herself."
Ezekiel,22,4,"You have become guilty by the blood which you have shed, and have defiled yourself with the idols which you have made. You have caused your days to draw near, and have come to the end of your years; therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations, and a mockery to all countries."
Ezekiel,22,5,Those near and those far from you will mock you as infamous and full of tumult.
Ezekiel,22,6,"“Look, the princes of Israel: each one has used his power to shed blood in you."
Ezekiel,22,7,In you they have made light of father and mother; in your midst they have oppressed the stranger; in you they have mistreated the fatherless and the widow.
Ezekiel,22,8,You have despised My holy things and profaned My Sabbaths.
Ezekiel,22,9,In you are men who slander to cause bloodshed; in you are those who eat on the mountains; in your midst they commit lewdness.
Ezekiel,22,10,In you men uncover their fathers’ nakedness; in you they violate women who are set apart during their impurity.
Ezekiel,22,11,"One commits abomination with his neighbor’s wife; another lewdly defiles his daughter-in-law; and another in you violates his sister, his father’s daughter."
Ezekiel,22,12,"In you they take bribes to shed blood; you take usury and increase; you have made profit from your neighbors by extortion, and have forgotten Me,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,22,13,"“Behold, therefore, I beat My fists at the dishonest profit which you have made, and at the bloodshed which has been in your midst."
Ezekiel,22,14,"Can your heart endure, or can your hands remain strong, in the days when I shall deal with you? I, the LORD, have spoken, and will do it."
Ezekiel,22,15,"I will scatter you among the nations, disperse you throughout the countries, and remove your filthiness completely from you."
Ezekiel,22,16,You shall defile yourself in the sight of the nations; then you shall know that I am the LORD.”’”
Ezekiel,22,17,"The word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,22,18,"“Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to Me; they are all bronze, tin, iron, and lead, in the midst of a furnace; they have become dross from silver."
Ezekiel,22,19,"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: ‘Because you have all become dross, therefore behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,22,20,"As men gather silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin into the midst of a furnace, to blow fire on it, to melt it; so I will gather you in My anger and in My fury, and I will leave you there and melt you."
Ezekiel,22,21,"Yes, I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of My wrath, and you shall be melted in its midst."
Ezekiel,22,22,"As silver is melted in the midst of a furnace, so shall you be melted in its midst; then you shall know that I, the LORD, have poured out My fury on you.’”"
Ezekiel,22,23,"And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,22,24,"“Son of man, say to her: ‘You are a land that is not cleansed or rained on in the day of indignation.’"
Ezekiel,22,25,The conspiracy of her prophets in her midst is like a roaring lion tearing the prey; they have devoured people; they have taken treasure and precious things; they have made many widows in her midst.
Ezekiel,22,26,"Her priests have violated My law and profaned My holy things; they have not distinguished between the holy and unholy, nor have they made known the difference between the unclean and the clean; and they have hidden their eyes from My Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them."
Ezekiel,22,27,"Her princes in her midst are like wolves tearing the prey, to shed blood, to destroy people, and to get dishonest gain."
Ezekiel,22,28,"Her prophets plastered them with untempered mortar, seeing false visions, and divining lies for them, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD,’ when the LORD had not spoken."
Ezekiel,22,29,"The people of the land have used oppressions, committed robbery, and mistreated the poor and needy; and they wrongfully oppress the stranger."
Ezekiel,22,30,"So I sought for a man among them who would make a wall, and stand in the gap before Me on behalf of the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found no one."
Ezekiel,22,31,"Therefore I have poured out My indignation on them; I have consumed them with the fire of My wrath; and I have recompensed their deeds on their own heads,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,23,1,"The word of the LORD came again to me, saying:"
Ezekiel,23,2,"“Son of man, there were two women, The daughters of one mother."
Ezekiel,23,3,"They committed harlotry in Egypt, They committed harlotry in their youth; Their breasts were there embraced, Their virgin bosom was there pressed."
Ezekiel,23,4,"Their names: Oholah the elder and Oholibah her sister; They were Mine, And they bore sons and daughters. As for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem is Oholibah."
Ezekiel,23,5,"“Oholah played the harlot even though she was Mine; And she lusted for her lovers, the neighboring Assyrians,"
Ezekiel,23,6,"Who were clothed in purple, Captains and rulers, All of them desirable young men, Horsemen riding on horses."
Ezekiel,23,7,"Thus she committed her harlotry with them, All of them choice men of Assyria; And with all for whom she lusted, With all their idols, she defiled herself."
Ezekiel,23,8,"She has never given up her harlotry brought from Egypt, For in her youth they had lain with her, Pressed her virgin bosom, And poured out their immorality upon her."
Ezekiel,23,9,"“Therefore I have delivered her Into the hand of her lovers, Into the hand of the Assyrians, For whom she lusted."
Ezekiel,23,10,"They uncovered her nakedness, Took away her sons and daughters, And slew her with the sword; She became a byword among women, For they had executed judgment on her."
Ezekiel,23,11,"“Now although her sister Oholibah saw this, she became more corrupt in her lust than she, and in her harlotry more corrupt than her sister’s harlotry."
Ezekiel,23,12,"“She lusted for the neighboring Assyrians, Captains and rulers, Clothed most gorgeously, Horsemen riding on horses, All of them desirable young men."
Ezekiel,23,13,Then I saw that she was defiled; Both took the same way.
Ezekiel,23,14,"But she increased her harlotry; She looked at men portrayed on the wall, Images of Chaldeans portrayed in vermilion,"
Ezekiel,23,15,"Girded with belts around their waists, Flowing turbans on their heads, All of them looking like captains, In the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, The land of their nativity."
Ezekiel,23,16,"As soon as her eyes saw them, She lusted for them And sent messengers to them in Chaldea."
Ezekiel,23,17,"“Then the Babylonians came to her, into the bed of love, And they defiled her with their immorality; So she was defiled by them, and alienated herself from them."
Ezekiel,23,18,"She revealed her harlotry and uncovered her nakedness. Then I alienated Myself from her, As I had alienated Myself from her sister."
Ezekiel,23,19,"“Yet she multiplied her harlotry In calling to remembrance the days of her youth, When she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt."
Ezekiel,23,20,"For she lusted for her paramours, Whose flesh is like the flesh of donkeys, And whose issue is like the issue of horses."
Ezekiel,23,21,"Thus you called to remembrance the lewdness of your youth, When the Egyptians pressed your bosom Because of your youthful breasts."
Ezekiel,23,22,"“Therefore, Oholibah, thus says the Lord GOD: ‘Behold, I will stir up your lovers against you, From whom you have alienated yourself, And I will bring them against you from every side:"
Ezekiel,23,23,"The Babylonians, All the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa, Koa, All the Assyrians with them, All of them desirable young men, Governors and rulers, Captains and men of renown, All of them riding on horses."
Ezekiel,23,24,"And they shall come against you With chariots, wagons, and war-horses, With a horde of people. They shall array against you Buckler, shield, and helmet all around. ‘I will delegate judgment to them, And they shall judge you according to their judgments."
Ezekiel,23,25,"I will set My jealousy against you, And they shall deal furiously with you; They shall remove your nose and your ears, And your remnant shall fall by the sword; They shall take your sons and your daughters, And your remnant shall be devoured by fire."
Ezekiel,23,26,They shall also strip you of your clothes And take away your beautiful jewelry.
Ezekiel,23,27,"‘Thus I will make you cease your lewdness and your harlotry Brought from the land of Egypt, So that you will not lift your eyes to them, Nor remember Egypt anymore.’"
Ezekiel,23,28,"“For thus says the Lord GOD: ‘Surely I will deliver you into the hand of those you hate, into the hand of those from whom you alienated yourself."
Ezekiel,23,29,"They will deal hatefully with you, take away all you have worked for, and leave you naked and bare. The nakedness of your harlotry shall be uncovered, both your lewdness and your harlotry."
Ezekiel,23,30,"I will do these things to you because you have gone as a harlot after the Gentiles, because you have become defiled by their idols."
Ezekiel,23,31,You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will put her cup in your hand.’
Ezekiel,23,32,"“Thus says the Lord GOD: ‘You shall drink of your sister’s cup, The deep and wide one; You shall be laughed to scorn And held in derision; It contains much."
Ezekiel,23,33,"You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, The cup of horror and desolation, The cup of your sister Samaria."
Ezekiel,23,34,"You shall drink and drain it, You shall break its shards, And tear at your own breasts; For I have spoken,’ Says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,23,35,"“Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: ‘Because you have forgotten Me and cast Me behind your back, Therefore you shall bear the penalty Of your lewdness and your harlotry.’”"
Ezekiel,23,36,"The LORD also said to me: “Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominations."
Ezekiel,23,37,"For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands. They have committed adultery with their idols, and even sacrificed their sons whom they bore to Me, passing them through the fire, to devour them."
Ezekiel,23,38,Moreover they have done this to Me: They have defiled My sanctuary on the same day and profaned My Sabbaths.
Ezekiel,23,39,"For after they had slain their children for their idols, on the same day they came into My sanctuary to profane it; and indeed thus they have done in the midst of My house."
Ezekiel,23,40,"“Furthermore you sent for men to come from afar, to whom a messenger was sent; and there they came. And you washed yourself for them, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with ornaments."
Ezekiel,23,41,"You sat on a stately couch, with a table prepared before it, on which you had set My incense and My oil."
Ezekiel,23,42,"The sound of a carefree multitude was with her, and Sabeans were brought from the wilderness with men of the common sort, who put bracelets on their wrists and beautiful crowns on their heads."
Ezekiel,23,43,"Then I said concerning her who had grown old in adulteries, ‘Will they commit harlotry with her now, and she with them?’"
Ezekiel,23,44,"Yet they went in to her, as men go in to a woman who plays the harlot; thus they went in to Oholah and Oholibah, the lewd women."
Ezekiel,23,45,"But righteous men will judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses, and blood is on their hands."
Ezekiel,23,46,"“For thus says the Lord GOD: ‘Bring up an assembly against them, give them up to trouble and plunder."
Ezekiel,23,47,"The assembly shall stone them with stones and execute them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn their houses with fire."
Ezekiel,23,48,"Thus I will cause lewdness to cease from the land, that all women may be taught not to practice your lewdness."
Ezekiel,23,49,"They shall repay you for your lewdness, and you shall pay for your idolatrous sins. Then you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.’”"
Ezekiel,24,1,"Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,24,2,"“Son of man, write down the name of the day, this very day—the king of Babylon started his siege against Jerusalem this very day."
Ezekiel,24,3,"And utter a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Put on a pot, set it on, And also pour water into it."
Ezekiel,24,4,"Gather pieces of meat in it, Every good piece, The thigh and the shoulder. Fill it with choice cuts;"
Ezekiel,24,5,"Take the choice of the flock. Also pile fuel bones under it, Make it boil well, And let the cuts simmer in it.”"
Ezekiel,24,6,"‘Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: “Woe to the bloody city, To the pot whose scum is in it, And whose scum is not gone from it! Bring it out piece by piece, On which no lot has fallen."
Ezekiel,24,7,"For her blood is in her midst; She set it on top of a rock; She did not pour it on the ground, To cover it with dust."
Ezekiel,24,8,"That it may raise up fury and take vengeance, I have set her blood on top of a rock, That it may not be covered.”"
Ezekiel,24,9,‘Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: “Woe to the bloody city! I too will make the pyre great.
Ezekiel,24,10,"Heap on the wood, Kindle the fire; Cook the meat well, Mix in the spices, And let the cuts be burned up."
Ezekiel,24,11,"“Then set the pot empty on the coals, That it may become hot and its bronze may burn, That its filthiness may be melted in it, That its scum may be consumed."
Ezekiel,24,12,"She has grown weary with lies, And her great scum has not gone from her. Let her scum be in the fire!"
Ezekiel,24,13,"In your filthiness is lewdness. Because I have cleansed you, and you were not cleansed, You will not be cleansed of your filthiness anymore, Till I have caused My fury to rest upon you."
Ezekiel,24,14,"I, the LORD, have spoken it; It shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not hold back, Nor will I spare, Nor will I relent; According to your ways And according to your deeds They will judge you,” Says the Lord GOD.’”"
Ezekiel,24,15,"Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,24,16,"“Son of man, behold, I take away from you the desire of your eyes with one stroke; yet you shall neither mourn nor weep, nor shall your tears run down."
Ezekiel,24,17,"Sigh in silence, make no mourning for the dead; bind your turban on your head, and put your sandals on your feet; do not cover your lips, and do not eat man’s bread of sorrow.”"
Ezekiel,24,18,"So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died; and the next morning I did as I was commanded."
Ezekiel,24,19,"And the people said to me, “Will you not tell us what these things signify to us, that you behave so?”"
Ezekiel,24,20,"Then I answered them, “The word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,24,21,"‘Speak to the house of Israel, “Thus says the Lord GOD: ‘Behold, I will profane My sanctuary, your arrogant boast, the desire of your eyes, the delight of your soul; and your sons and daughters whom you left behind shall fall by the sword."
Ezekiel,24,22,And you shall do as I have done; you shall not cover your lips nor eat man’s bread of sorrow.
Ezekiel,24,23,"Your turbans shall be on your heads and your sandals on your feet; you shall neither mourn nor weep, but you shall pine away in your iniquities and mourn with one another."
Ezekiel,24,24,"Thus Ezekiel is a sign to you; according to all that he has done you shall do; and when this comes, you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.’”"
Ezekiel,24,25,"‘And you, son of man—will it not be in the day when I take from them their stronghold, their joy and their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that on which they set their minds, their sons and their daughters:"
Ezekiel,24,26,that on that day one who escapes will come to you to let you hear it with your ears?
Ezekiel,24,27,"On that day your mouth will be opened to him who has escaped; you shall speak and no longer be mute. Thus you will be a sign to them, and they shall know that I am the LORD.’”"
Ezekiel,25,1,"The word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,25,2,"“Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them."
Ezekiel,25,3,"Say to the Ammonites, ‘Hear the word of the Lord GOD! Thus says the Lord GOD: “Because you said, ‘Aha!’ against My sanctuary when it was profaned, and against the land of Israel when it was desolate, and against the house of Judah when they went into captivity,"
Ezekiel,25,4,"indeed, therefore, I will deliver you as a possession to the men of the East, and they shall set their encampments among you and make their dwellings among you; they shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk."
Ezekiel,25,5,And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels and Ammon a resting place for flocks. Then you shall know that I am the LORD.”
Ezekiel,25,6,"‘For thus says the Lord GOD: “Because you clapped your hands, stamped your feet, and rejoiced in heart with all your disdain for the land of Israel,"
Ezekiel,25,7,"indeed, therefore, I will stretch out My hand against you, and give you as plunder to the nations; I will cut you off from the peoples, and I will cause you to perish from the countries; I will destroy you, and you shall know that I am the LORD.”"
Ezekiel,25,8,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Because Moab and Seir say, ‘Look! The house of Judah is like all the nations,’"
Ezekiel,25,9,"therefore, behold, I will clear the territory of Moab of cities, of the cities on its frontier, the glory of the country, Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon, and Kirjathaim."
Ezekiel,25,10,"To the men of the East I will give it as a possession, together with the Ammonites, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations."
Ezekiel,25,11,"And I will execute judgments upon Moab, and they shall know that I am the LORD.”"
Ezekiel,25,12,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Because of what Edom did against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has greatly offended by avenging itself on them,”"
Ezekiel,25,13,"therefore thus says the Lord GOD: “I will also stretch out My hand against Edom, cut off man and beast from it, and make it desolate from Teman; Dedan shall fall by the sword."
Ezekiel,25,14,"I will lay My vengeance on Edom by the hand of My people Israel, that they may do in Edom according to My anger and according to My fury; and they shall know My vengeance,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,25,15,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Because the Philistines dealt vengefully and took vengeance with a spiteful heart, to destroy because of the old hatred,”"
Ezekiel,25,16,"therefore thus says the Lord GOD: “I will stretch out My hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites and destroy the remnant of the seacoast."
Ezekiel,25,17,"I will execute great vengeance on them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I lay My vengeance upon them.”’”"
Ezekiel,26,1,"And it came to pass in the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,26,2,"“Son of man, because Tyre has said against Jerusalem, ‘Aha! She is broken who was the gateway of the peoples; now she is turned over to me; I shall be filled; she is laid waste.’"
Ezekiel,26,3,"“Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: ‘Behold, I am against you, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against you, as the sea causes its waves to come up."
Ezekiel,26,4,"And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers; I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock."
Ezekiel,26,5,"It shall be a place for spreading nets in the midst of the sea, for I have spoken,’ says the Lord GOD; ‘it shall become plunder for the nations."
Ezekiel,26,6,Also her daughter villages which are in the fields shall be slain by the sword. Then they shall know that I am the LORD.’
Ezekiel,26,7,"“For thus says the Lord GOD: ‘Behold, I will bring against Tyre from the north Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses, with chariots, and with horsemen, and an army with many people."
Ezekiel,26,8,"He will slay with the sword your daughter villages in the fields; he will heap up a siege mound against you, build a wall against you, and raise a defense against you."
Ezekiel,26,9,"He will direct his battering rams against your walls, and with his axes he will break down your towers."
Ezekiel,26,10,"Because of the abundance of his horses, their dust will cover you; your walls will shake at the noise of the horsemen, the wagons, and the chariots, when he enters your gates, as men enter a city that has been breached."
Ezekiel,26,11,"With the hooves of his horses he will trample all your streets; he will slay your people by the sword, and your strong pillars will fall to the ground."
Ezekiel,26,12,"They will plunder your riches and pillage your merchandise; they will break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses; they will lay your stones, your timber, and your soil in the midst of the water."
Ezekiel,26,13,"I will put an end to the sound of your songs, and the sound of your harps shall be heard no more."
Ezekiel,26,14,"I will make you like the top of a rock; you shall be a place for spreading nets, and you shall never be rebuilt, for I the LORD have spoken,’ says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,26,15,"“Thus says the Lord GOD to Tyre: ‘Will the coastlands not shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded cry, when slaughter is made in the midst of you?"
Ezekiel,26,16,"Then all the princes of the sea will come down from their thrones, lay aside their robes, and take off their embroidered garments; they will clothe themselves with trembling; they will sit on the ground, tremble every moment, and be astonished at you."
Ezekiel,26,17,"And they will take up a lamentation for you, and say to you: “How you have perished, O one inhabited by seafaring men, O renowned city, Who was strong at sea, She and her inhabitants, Who caused their terror to be on all her inhabitants!"
Ezekiel,26,18,"Now the coastlands tremble on the day of your fall; Yes, the coastlands by the sea are troubled at your departure.”’"
Ezekiel,26,19,"“For thus says the Lord GOD: ‘When I make you a desolate city, like cities that are not inhabited, when I bring the deep upon you, and great waters cover you,"
Ezekiel,26,20,"then I will bring you down with those who descend into the Pit, to the people of old, and I will make you dwell in the lowest part of the earth, in places desolate from antiquity, with those who go down to the Pit, so that you may never be inhabited; and I shall establish glory in the land of the living."

Ezekiel,27,27,"“Your riches, wares, and merchandise, Your mariners and pilots, Your caulkers and merchandisers, All your men of war who are in you, And the entire company which is in your midst, Will fall into the midst of the seas on the day of your ruin."
Ezekiel,27,28,The common-land will shake at the sound of the cry of your pilots.
Ezekiel,27,29,"“All who handle the oar, The mariners, All the pilots of the sea Will come down from their ships and stand on the shore."
Ezekiel,27,30,They will make their voice heard because of you; They will cry bitterly and cast dust on their heads; They will roll about in ashes;
Ezekiel,27,31,"They will shave themselves completely bald because of you, Gird themselves with sackcloth, And weep for you With bitterness of heart and bitter wailing."
Ezekiel,27,32,"In their wailing for you They will take up a lamentation, And lament for you: ‘What city is like Tyre, Destroyed in the midst of the sea?"
Ezekiel,27,33,"‘When your wares went out by sea, You satisfied many people; You enriched the kings of the earth With your many luxury goods and your merchandise."
Ezekiel,27,34,But you are broken by the seas in the depths of the waters; Your merchandise and the entire company will fall in your midst.
Ezekiel,27,35,"All the inhabitants of the isles will be astonished at you; Their kings will be greatly afraid, And their countenance will be troubled."

Ezekiel,30,25,"Thus I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, but the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; they shall know that I am the LORD, when I put My sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he stretches it out against the land of Egypt."
Ezekiel,30,26,I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them throughout the countries. Then they shall know that I am the LORD.’”
Ezekiel,31,1,"Now it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,31,2,"“Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his multitude: ‘Whom are you like in your greatness?"
Ezekiel,31,3,"Indeed Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon, With fine branches that shaded the forest, And of high stature; And its top was among the thick boughs."
Ezekiel,31,4,"The waters made it grow; Underground waters gave it height, With their rivers running around the place where it was planted, And sent out rivulets to all the trees of the field."
Ezekiel,31,5,"‘Therefore its height was exalted above all the trees of the field; Its boughs were multiplied, And its branches became long because of the abundance of water, As it sent them out."
Ezekiel,31,6,All the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs; Under its branches all the beasts of the field brought forth their young; And in its shadow all great nations made their home.
Ezekiel,31,7,"‘Thus it was beautiful in greatness and in the length of its branches, Because its roots reached to abundant waters."
Ezekiel,31,8,"The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it; The fir trees were not like its boughs, And the chestnut trees were not like its branches; No tree in the garden of God was like it in beauty."
Ezekiel,31,9,"I made it beautiful with a multitude of branches, So that all the trees of Eden envied it, That were in the garden of God.’"
Ezekiel,31,10,"“Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: ‘Because you have increased in height, and it set its top among the thick boughs, and its heart was lifted up in its height,"
Ezekiel,31,11,"therefore I will deliver it into the hand of the mighty one of the nations, and he shall surely deal with it; I have driven it out for its wickedness."
Ezekiel,31,12,"And aliens, the most terrible of the nations, have cut it down and left it; its branches have fallen on the mountains and in all the valleys; its boughs lie broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the peoples of the earth have gone from under its shadow and left it."
Ezekiel,31,13,"‘On its ruin will remain all the birds of the heavens, And all the beasts of the field will come to its branches—"
Ezekiel,31,14,"‘So that no trees by the waters may ever again exalt themselves for their height, nor set their tops among the thick boughs, that no tree which drinks water may ever be high enough to reach up to them. ‘For they have all been delivered to death, To the depths of the earth, Among the children of men who go down to the Pit.’"
Ezekiel,31,15,"“Thus says the Lord GOD: ‘In the day when it went down to hell, I caused mourning. I covered the deep because of it. I restrained its rivers, and the great waters were held back. I caused Lebanon to mourn for it, and all the trees of the field wilted because of it."
Ezekiel,31,16,"I made the nations shake at the sound of its fall, when I cast it down to hell together with those who descend into the Pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the depths of the earth."
Ezekiel,31,17,"They also went down to hell with it, with those slain by the sword; and those who were its strong arm dwelt in its shadows among the nations."
Ezekiel,31,18,"‘To which of the trees in Eden will you then be likened in glory and greatness? Yet you shall be brought down with the trees of Eden to the depths of the earth; you shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with those slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude,’ says the Lord GOD.”"
Ezekiel,32,1,"And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,32,2,"“Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him: ‘You are like a young lion among the nations, And you are like a monster in the seas, Bursting forth in your rivers, Troubling the waters with your feet, And fouling their rivers."
Ezekiel,32,3,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “I will therefore spread My net over you with a company of many people, And they will draw you up in My net."
Ezekiel,32,4,"Then I will leave you on the land; I will cast you out on the open fields, And cause to settle on you all the birds of the heavens. And with you I will fill the beasts of the whole earth."
Ezekiel,32,5,"I will lay your flesh on the mountains, And fill the valleys with your carcass."
Ezekiel,32,6,"“I will also water the land with the flow of your blood, Even to the mountains; And the riverbeds will be full of you."
Ezekiel,32,7,"When I put out your light, I will cover the heavens, and make its stars dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, And the moon shall not give her light."
Ezekiel,32,8,"All the bright lights of the heavens I will make dark over you, And bring darkness upon your land,” Says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,32,9,"‘I will also trouble the hearts of many peoples, when I bring your destruction among the nations, into the countries which you have not known."
Ezekiel,32,10,"Yes, I will make many peoples astonished at you, and their kings shall be horribly afraid of you when I brandish My sword before them; and they shall tremble every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of your fall."
Ezekiel,32,11,‘For thus says the Lord GOD: “The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon you.
Ezekiel,32,12,"By the swords of the mighty warriors, all of them the most terrible of the nations, I will cause your multitude to fall. “They shall plunder the pomp of Egypt, And all its multitude shall be destroyed."
Ezekiel,32,13,"Also I will destroy all its animals From beside its great waters; The foot of man shall muddy them no more, Nor shall the hooves of animals muddy them."
Ezekiel,32,14,"Then I will make their waters clear, And make their rivers run like oil,” Says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,32,15,"“When I make the land of Egypt desolate, And the country is destitute of all that once filled it, When I strike all who dwell in it, Then they shall know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,32,16,"“This is the lamentation With which they shall lament her; The daughters of the nations shall lament her; They shall lament for her, for Egypt, And for all her multitude,” Says the Lord GOD.’”"
Ezekiel,32,17,"It came to pass also in the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying:"
Ezekiel,32,18,"“Son of man, wail over the multitude of Egypt, And cast them down to the depths of the earth, Her and the daughters of the famous nations, With those who go down to the Pit:"
Ezekiel,32,19,"‘Whom do you surpass in beauty? Go down, be placed with the uncircumcised.’"
Ezekiel,32,20,"“They shall fall in the midst of those slain by the sword; She is delivered to the sword, Drawing her and all her multitudes."
Ezekiel,32,21,"The strong among the mighty Shall speak to him out of the midst of hell With those who help him: ‘They have gone down, They lie with the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.’"
Ezekiel,32,22,"“Assyria is there, and all her company, With their graves all around her, All of them slain, fallen by the sword."
Ezekiel,32,23,"Her graves are set in the recesses of the Pit, And her company is all around her grave, All of them slain, fallen by the sword, Who caused terror in the land of the living."
Ezekiel,32,24,"“There is Elam and all her multitude, All around her grave, All of them slain, fallen by the sword, Who have gone down uncircumcised to the lower parts of the earth, Who caused their terror in the land of the living; Now they bear their shame with those who go down to the Pit."
Ezekiel,32,25,"They have set her bed in the midst of the slain, With all her multitude, With her graves all around it, All of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; Though their terror was caused In the land of the living, Yet they bear their shame With those who go down to the Pit; It was put in the midst of the slain."
Ezekiel,32,26,"“There are Meshech and Tubal and all their multitudes, With all their graves around it, All of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, Though they caused their terror in the land of the living."
Ezekiel,32,27,"They do not lie with the mighty Who are fallen of the uncircumcised, Who have gone down to hell with their weapons of war; They have laid their swords under their heads, But their iniquities will be on their bones, Because of the terror of the mighty in the land of the living."
Ezekiel,32,28,"Yes, you shall be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, And lie with those slain by the sword."
Ezekiel,32,29,"“There is Edom, Her kings and all her princes, Who despite their might Are laid beside those slain by the sword; They shall lie with the uncircumcised, And with those who go down to the Pit."
Ezekiel,32,30,"There are the princes of the north, All of them, and all the Sidonians, Who have gone down with the slain In shame at the terror which they caused by their might; They lie uncircumcised with those slain by the sword, And bear their shame with those who go down to the Pit."
Ezekiel,32,31,"“Pharaoh will see them And be comforted over all his multitude, Pharaoh and all his army, Slain by the sword,” Says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,32,32,"“For I have caused My terror in the land of the living; And he shall be placed in the midst of the uncircumcised With those slain by the sword, Pharaoh and all his multitude,” Says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,33,1,"Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,33,2,"“Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and say to them: ‘When I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from their territory and make him their watchman,"
Ezekiel,33,3,"when he sees the sword coming upon the land, if he blows the trumpet and warns the people,"
Ezekiel,33,4,"then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet and does not take warning, if the sword comes and takes him away, his blood shall be on his own head."
Ezekiel,33,5,"He heard the sound of the trumpet, but did not take warning; his blood shall be upon himself. But he who takes warning will save his life."
Ezekiel,33,6,"But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, and the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at the watchman’s hand.’"
Ezekiel,33,7,"“So you, son of man: I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; therefore you shall hear a word from My mouth and warn them for Me."
Ezekiel,33,8,"When I say to the wicked, ‘O wicked man, you shall surely die!’ and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand."
Ezekiel,33,9,"Nevertheless if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul."
Ezekiel,33,10,"“Therefore you, O son of man, say to the house of Israel: ‘Thus you say, “If our transgressions and our sins lie upon us, and we pine away in them, how can we then live?”’"
Ezekiel,33,11,"Say to them: ‘As I live,’ says the Lord GOD, ‘I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn, turn from your evil ways! For why should you die, O house of Israel?’"
Ezekiel,33,12,"“Therefore you, O son of man, say to the children of your people: ‘The righteousness of the righteous man shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression; as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall because of it in the day that he turns from his wickedness; nor shall the righteous be able to live because of his righteousness in the day that he sins.’"
Ezekiel,33,13,"When I say to the righteous that he shall surely live, but he trusts in his own righteousness and commits iniquity, none of his righteous works shall be remembered; but because of the iniquity that he has committed, he shall die."
Ezekiel,33,14,"Again, when I say to the wicked, ‘You shall surely die,’ if he turns from his sin and does what is lawful and right,"
Ezekiel,33,15,"if the wicked restores the pledge, gives back what he has stolen, and walks in the statutes of life without committing iniquity, he shall surely live; he shall not die."
Ezekiel,33,16,None of his sins which he has committed shall be remembered against him; he has done what is lawful and right; he shall surely live.
Ezekiel,33,17,"“Yet the children of your people say, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair.’ But it is their way which is not fair!"
Ezekiel,33,18,"When the righteous turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he shall die because of it."
Ezekiel,33,19,"But when the wicked turns from his wickedness and does what is lawful and right, he shall live because of it."
Ezekiel,33,20,"Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair.’ O house of Israel, I will judge every one of you according to his own ways.”"
Ezekiel,33,21,"And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, that one who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said, “The city has been captured!”"
Ezekiel,33,22,"Now the hand of the LORD had been upon me the evening before the man came who had escaped. And He had opened my mouth; so when he came to me in the morning, my mouth was opened, and I was no longer mute."
Ezekiel,33,23,"Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying:"
Ezekiel,33,24,"“Son of man, they who inhabit those ruins in the land of Israel are saying, ‘Abraham was only one, and he inherited the land. But we are many; the land has been given to us as a possession.’"
Ezekiel,33,25,"“Therefore say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “You eat meat with blood, you lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood. Should you then possess the land?"
Ezekiel,33,26,"You rely on your sword, you commit abominations, and you defile one another’s wives. Should you then possess the land?”’"
Ezekiel,33,27,"“Say thus to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “As I live, surely those who are in the ruins shall fall by the sword, and the one who is in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured, and those who are in the strongholds and caves shall die of the pestilence."
Ezekiel,33,28,"For I will make the land most desolate, her arrogant strength shall cease, and the mountains of Israel shall be so desolate that no one will pass through."
Ezekiel,33,29,"Then they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have made the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed.”’"
Ezekiel,33,30,"“As for you, son of man, the children of your people are talking about you beside the walls and in the doors of the houses; and they speak to one another, everyone saying to his brother, ‘Please come and hear what the word is that comes from the LORD.’"
Ezekiel,33,31,"So they come to you as people do, they sit before you as My people, and they hear your words, but they do not do them; for with their mouth they show much love, but their hearts pursue their own gain."
Ezekiel,33,32,"Indeed you are to them as a very lovely song of one who has a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument; for they hear your words, but they do not do them."
Ezekiel,33,33,And when this comes to pass—surely it will come—then they will know that a prophet has been among them.”
Ezekiel,34,1,"And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,34,2,"“Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD to the shepherds: “Woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flocks?"
Ezekiel,34,3,"You eat the fat and clothe yourselves with the wool; you slaughter the fatlings, but you do not feed the flock."
Ezekiel,34,4,"The weak you have not strengthened, nor have you healed those who were sick, nor bound up the broken, nor brought back what was driven away, nor sought what was lost; but with force and cruelty you have ruled them."
Ezekiel,34,5,So they were scattered because there was no shepherd; and they became food for all the beasts of the field when they were scattered.
Ezekiel,34,6,"My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and on every high hill; yes, My flock was scattered over the whole face of the earth, and no one was seeking or searching for them.”"
Ezekiel,34,7,"‘Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:"
Ezekiel,34,8,"“As I live,” says the Lord GOD, “surely because My flock became a prey, and My flock became food for every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, nor did My shepherds search for My flock, but the shepherds fed themselves and did not feed My flock”—"
Ezekiel,34,9,"therefore, O shepherds, hear the word of the LORD!"
Ezekiel,34,10,"Thus says the Lord GOD: “Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will require My flock at their hand; I will cause them to cease feeding the sheep, and the shepherds shall feed themselves no more; for I will deliver My flock from their mouths, that they may no longer be food for them.”"
Ezekiel,34,11,‘For thus says the Lord GOD: “Indeed I Myself will search for My sheep and seek them out.
Ezekiel,34,12,"As a shepherd seeks out his flock on the day he is among his scattered sheep, so will I seek out My sheep and deliver them from all the places where they were scattered on a cloudy and dark day."
Ezekiel,34,13,"And I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land; I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, in the valleys and in all the inhabited places of the country."
Ezekiel,34,14,"I will feed them in good pasture, and their fold shall be on the high mountains of Israel. There they shall lie down in a good fold and feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel."
Ezekiel,34,15,"I will feed My flock, and I will make them lie down,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,34,16,"“I will seek what was lost and bring back what was driven away, bind up the broken and strengthen what was sick; but I will destroy the fat and the strong, and feed them in judgment.”"
Ezekiel,34,17,"‘And as for you, O My flock, thus says the Lord GOD: “Behold, I shall judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and goats."
Ezekiel,34,18,"Is it too little for you to have eaten up the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture—and to have drunk of the clear waters, that you must foul the residue with your feet?"
Ezekiel,34,19,"And as for My flock, they eat what you have trampled with your feet, and they drink what you have fouled with your feet.”"
Ezekiel,34,20,"‘Therefore thus says the Lord GOD to them: “Behold, I Myself will judge between the fat and the lean sheep."
Ezekiel,34,21,"Because you have pushed with side and shoulder, butted all the weak ones with your horns, and scattered them abroad,"
Ezekiel,34,22,"therefore I will save My flock, and they shall no longer be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep."
Ezekiel,34,23,"I will establish one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them—My servant David. He shall feed them and be their shepherd."
Ezekiel,34,24,"And I, the LORD, will be their God, and My servant David a prince among them; I, the LORD, have spoken."
Ezekiel,34,25,"“I will make a covenant of peace with them, and cause wild beasts to cease from the land; and they will dwell safely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods."
Ezekiel,34,26,I will make them and the places all around My hill a blessing; and I will cause showers to come down in their season; there shall be showers of blessing.
Ezekiel,34,27,"Then the trees of the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase. They shall be safe in their land; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke and delivered them from the hand of those who enslaved them."
Ezekiel,34,28,"And they shall no longer be a prey for the nations, nor shall beasts of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and no one shall make them afraid."
Ezekiel,34,29,"I will raise up for them a garden of renown, and they shall no longer be consumed with hunger in the land, nor bear the shame of the Gentiles anymore."
Ezekiel,34,30,"Thus they shall know that I, the LORD their God, am with them, and they, the house of Israel, are My people,” says the Lord GOD.’"
Ezekiel,34,31,"“You are My flock, the flock of My pasture; you are men, and I am your God,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,35,1,"Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,35,2,"“Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir and prophesy against it,"
Ezekiel,35,3,"and say to it, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Behold, O Mount Seir, I am against you; I will stretch out My hand against you, And make you most desolate;"
Ezekiel,35,4,"I shall lay your cities waste, And you shall be desolate. Then you shall know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,35,5,"“Because you have had an ancient hatred, and have shed the blood of the children of Israel by the power of the sword at the time of their calamity, when their iniquity came to an end,"
Ezekiel,35,6,"therefore, as I live,” says the Lord GOD, “I will prepare you for blood, and blood shall pursue you; since you have not hated blood, therefore blood shall pursue you."
Ezekiel,35,7,"Thus I will make Mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it the one who leaves and the one who returns."
Ezekiel,35,8,And I will fill its mountains with the slain; on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines those who are slain by the sword shall fall.
Ezekiel,35,9,"I will make you perpetually desolate, and your cities shall be uninhabited; then you shall know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,35,10,"“Because you have said, ‘These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess them,’ although the LORD was there,"
Ezekiel,35,11,"therefore, as I live,” says the Lord GOD, “I will do according to your anger and according to the envy which you showed in your hatred against them; and I will make Myself known among them when I judge you."
Ezekiel,35,12,"Then you shall know that I am the LORD. I have heard all your blasphemies which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, ‘They are desolate; they are given to us to consume.’"
Ezekiel,35,13,Thus with your mouth you have boasted against Me and multiplied your words against Me; I have heard them.”
Ezekiel,35,14,‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “The whole earth will rejoice when I make you desolate.
Ezekiel,35,15,"As you rejoiced because the inheritance of the house of Israel was desolate, so I will do to you; you shall be desolate, O Mount Seir, as well as all of Edom—all of it! Then they shall know that I am the LORD.”’"
Ezekiel,36,1,"“And you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, ‘O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD!"
Ezekiel,36,2,"Thus says the Lord GOD: “Because the enemy has said of you, ‘Aha! The ancient heights have become our possession,’”’"
Ezekiel,36,3,"therefore prophesy, and say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Because they made you desolate and swallowed you up on every side, so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations, and you are taken up by the lips of talkers and slandered by the people”—"
Ezekiel,36,4,"therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD! Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains, the hills, the rivers, the valleys, the desolate wastes, and the cities that have been forsaken, which became plunder and mockery to the rest of the nations all around—"
Ezekiel,36,5,"therefore thus says the Lord GOD: “Surely I have spoken in My burning jealousy against the rest of the nations and against all Edom, who gave My land to themselves as a possession, with wholehearted joy and spiteful minds, in order to plunder its open country.”’"
Ezekiel,36,6,"“Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains, the hills, the rivers, and the valleys, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Behold, I have spoken in My jealousy and My fury, because you have borne the shame of the nations.”"
Ezekiel,36,7,Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: “I have raised My hand in an oath that surely the nations that are around you shall bear their own shame.
Ezekiel,36,8,"But you, O mountains of Israel, you shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to My people Israel, for they are about to come."
Ezekiel,36,9,"For indeed I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown."
Ezekiel,36,10,"I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, all of it; and the cities shall be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt."
Ezekiel,36,11,"I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bear young; I will make you inhabited as in former times, and do better for you than at your beginnings. Then you shall know that I am the LORD."
Ezekiel,36,12,"Yes, I will cause men to walk on you, My people Israel; they shall take possession of you, and you shall be their inheritance; no more shall you bereave them of children.”"
Ezekiel,36,13,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Because they say to you, ‘You devour men and bereave your nation of children,’"
Ezekiel,36,14,"therefore you shall devour men no more, nor bereave your nation anymore,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,36,15,"“Nor will I let you hear the taunts of the nations anymore, nor bear the reproach of the peoples anymore, nor shall you cause your nation to stumble anymore,” says the Lord GOD.’”"
Ezekiel,36,16,"Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying:"
Ezekiel,36,17,"“Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own ways and deeds; to Me their way was like the uncleanness of a woman in her customary impurity."
Ezekiel,36,18,"Therefore I poured out My fury on them for the blood they had shed on the land, and for their idols with which they had defiled it."
Ezekiel,36,19,"So I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed throughout the countries; I judged them according to their ways and their deeds."
Ezekiel,36,20,"When they came to the nations, wherever they went, they profaned My holy name—when they said of them, ‘These are the people of the LORD, and yet they have gone out of His land.’"
Ezekiel,36,21,"But I had concern for My holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations wherever they went."
Ezekiel,36,22,"“Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “I do not do this for your sake, O house of Israel, but for My holy name’s sake, which you have profaned among the nations wherever you went."
Ezekiel,36,23,"And I will sanctify My great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in their midst; and the nations shall know that I am the LORD,” says the Lord GOD, “when I am hallowed in you before their eyes."
Ezekiel,36,24,"For I will take you from among the nations, gather you out of all countries, and bring you into your own land."
Ezekiel,36,25,"Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean; I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols."
Ezekiel,36,26,I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.
Ezekiel,36,27,"I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will keep My judgments and do them."
Ezekiel,36,28,"Then you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; you shall be My people, and I will be your God."
Ezekiel,36,29,"I will deliver you from all your uncleannesses. I will call for the grain and multiply it, and bring no famine upon you."
Ezekiel,36,30,"And I will multiply the fruit of your trees and the increase of your fields, so that you need never again bear the reproach of famine among the nations."
Ezekiel,36,31,"Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good; and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight, for your iniquities and your abominations."
Ezekiel,36,32,"Not for your sake do I do this,” says the Lord GOD, “let it be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel!”"
Ezekiel,36,33,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will also enable you to dwell in the cities, and the ruins shall be rebuilt."
Ezekiel,36,34,The desolate land shall be tilled instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass by.
Ezekiel,36,35,"So they will say, ‘This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden; and the wasted, desolate, and ruined cities are now fortified and inhabited.’"
Ezekiel,36,36,"Then the nations which are left all around you shall know that I, the LORD, have rebuilt the ruined places and planted what was desolate. I, the LORD, have spoken it, and I will do it.”"
Ezekiel,36,37,‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “I will also let the house of Israel inquire of Me to do this for them: I will increase their men like a flock.
Ezekiel,36,38,"Like a flock offered as holy sacrifices, like the flock at Jerusalem on its feast days, so shall the ruined cities be filled with flocks of men. Then they shall know that I am the LORD.”’”"
Ezekiel,37,1,"The hand of the LORD came upon me and brought me out in the Spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones."
Ezekiel,37,2,"Then He caused me to pass by them all around, and behold, there were very many in the open valley; and indeed they were very dry."
Ezekiel,37,3,"And He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” So I answered, “O Lord GOD, You know.”"
Ezekiel,37,4,"Again He said to me, “Prophesy to these bones, and say to them, ‘O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD!"
Ezekiel,37,5,"Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones: “Surely I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live."
Ezekiel,37,6,"I will put sinews on you and bring flesh upon you, cover you with skin and put breath in you; and you shall live. Then you shall know that I am the LORD.”’”"
Ezekiel,37,7,"So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and suddenly a rattling; and the bones came together, bone to bone."
Ezekiel,37,8,"Indeed, as I looked, the sinews and the flesh came upon them, and the skin covered them over; but there was no breath in them."
Ezekiel,37,9,"Also He said to me, “Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.”’”"
Ezekiel,37,10,"So I prophesied as He commanded me, and breath came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, an exceedingly great army."
Ezekiel,37,11,"Then He said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. They indeed say, ‘Our bones are dry, our hope is lost, and we ourselves are cut off!’"
Ezekiel,37,12,"Therefore prophesy and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Behold, O My people, I will open your graves and cause you to come up from your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel."
Ezekiel,37,13,"Then you shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O My people, and brought you up from your graves."
Ezekiel,37,14,"I will put My Spirit in you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. Then you shall know that I, the LORD, have spoken it and performed it,” says the LORD.’”"
Ezekiel,37,15,"Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,37,16,"“As for you, son of man, take a stick for yourself and write on it: ‘For Judah and for the children of Israel, his companions.’ Then take another stick and write on it, ‘For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel, his companions.’"
Ezekiel,37,17,"Then join them one to another for yourself into one stick, and they will become one in your hand."
Ezekiel,37,18,"“And when the children of your people speak to you, saying, ‘Will you not show us what you mean by these?’—"
Ezekiel,37,19,"say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Surely I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel, his companions; and I will join them with it, with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they will be one in My hand.”’"
Ezekiel,37,20,And the sticks on which you write will be in your hand before their eyes.
Ezekiel,37,21,"“Then say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Surely I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, wherever they have gone, and will gather them from every side and bring them into their own land;"
Ezekiel,37,22,"and I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king over them all; they shall no longer be two nations, nor shall they ever be divided into two kingdoms again."
Ezekiel,37,23,"They shall not defile themselves anymore with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will deliver them from all their dwelling places in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them. Then they shall be My people, and I will be their God."
Ezekiel,37,24,"“David My servant shall be king over them, and they shall all have one shepherd; they shall also walk in My judgments and observe My statutes, and do them."
Ezekiel,37,25,"Then they shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob My servant, where your fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell there, they, their children, and their children’s children, forever; and My servant David shall be their prince forever."
Ezekiel,37,26,"Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them, and it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; I will establish them and multiply them, and I will set My sanctuary in their midst forevermore."
Ezekiel,37,27,"My tabernacle also shall be with them; indeed I will be their God, and they shall be My people."
Ezekiel,37,28,"The nations also will know that I, the LORD, sanctify Israel, when My sanctuary is in their midst forevermore.”’”"
Ezekiel,38,1,"Now the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,38,2,"“Son of man, set your face against Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him,"
Ezekiel,38,3,"and say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against you, O Gog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal."
Ezekiel,38,4,"I will turn you around, put hooks into your jaws, and lead you out, with all your army, horses, and horsemen, all splendidly clothed, a great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords."
Ezekiel,38,5,"Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya are with them, all of them with shield and helmet;"
Ezekiel,38,6,Gomer and all its troops; the house of Togarmah from the far north and all its troops—many people are with you.
Ezekiel,38,7,"“Prepare yourself and be ready, you and all your companies that are gathered about you; and be a guard for them."
Ezekiel,38,8,"After many days you will be visited. In the latter years you will come into the land of those brought back from the sword and gathered from many people on the mountains of Israel, which had long been desolate; they were brought out of the nations, and now all of them dwell safely."
Ezekiel,38,9,"You will ascend, coming like a storm, covering the land like a cloud, you and all your troops and many peoples with you.”"
Ezekiel,38,10,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “On that day it shall come to pass that thoughts will arise in your mind, and you will make an evil plan:"
Ezekiel,38,11,"You will say, ‘I will go up against a land of unwalled villages; I will go to a peaceful people, who dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates’—"
Ezekiel,38,12,"to take plunder and to take booty, to stretch out your hand against the waste places that are again inhabited, and against a people gathered from the nations, who have acquired livestock and goods, who dwell in the midst of the land."
Ezekiel,38,13,"Sheba, Dedan, the merchants of Tarshish, and all their young lions will say to you, ‘Have you come to take plunder? Have you gathered your army to take booty, to carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods, to take great plunder?’”’"
Ezekiel,38,14,"“Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “On that day when My people Israel dwell safely, will you not know it?"
Ezekiel,38,15,"Then you will come from your place out of the far north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great company and a mighty army."
Ezekiel,38,16,"You will come up against My people Israel like a cloud, to cover the land. It will be in the latter days that I will bring you against My land, so that the nations may know Me, when I am hallowed in you, O Gog, before their eyes.”"
Ezekiel,38,17,"Thus says the Lord GOD: “Are you he of whom I have spoken in former days by My servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied for years in those days that I would bring you against them?"
Ezekiel,38,18,"“And it will come to pass at the same time, when Gog comes against the land of Israel,” says the Lord GOD, “that My fury will show in My face."
Ezekiel,38,19,"For in My jealousy and in the fire of My wrath I have spoken: ‘Surely in that day there shall be a great earthquake in the land of Israel,"
Ezekiel,38,20,"so that the fish of the sea, the birds of the heavens, the beasts of the field, all creeping things that creep on the earth, and all men who are on the face of the earth shall shake at My presence. The mountains shall be thrown down, the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.’"
Ezekiel,38,21,"I will call for a sword against Gog throughout all My mountains,” says the Lord GOD. “Every man’s sword will be against his brother."
Ezekiel,38,22,"And I will bring him to judgment with pestilence and bloodshed; I will rain down on him, on his troops, and on the many peoples who are with him, flooding rain, great hailstones, fire, and brimstone."
Ezekiel,38,23,"Thus I will magnify Myself and sanctify Myself, and I will be known in the eyes of many nations. Then they shall know that I am the LORD.”’"
Ezekiel,39,1,"“And you, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Behold, I am against you, O Gog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal;"
Ezekiel,39,2,"and I will turn you around and lead you on, bringing you up from the far north, and bring you against the mountains of Israel."
Ezekiel,39,3,"Then I will knock the bow out of your left hand, and cause the arrows to fall out of your right hand."
Ezekiel,39,4,"You shall fall upon the mountains of Israel, you and all your troops and the peoples who are with you; I will give you to birds of prey of every sort and to the beasts of the field to be devoured."
Ezekiel,39,5,"You shall fall on the open field; for I have spoken,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,39,6,“And I will send fire on Magog and on those who live in security in the coastlands. Then they shall know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel,39,7,"So I will make My holy name known in the midst of My people Israel, and I will not let them profane My holy name anymore. Then the nations shall know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel."
Ezekiel,39,8,"Surely it is coming, and it shall be done,” says the Lord GOD. “This is the day of which I have spoken."
Ezekiel,39,9,"“Then those who dwell in the cities of Israel will go out and set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and bucklers, the bows and arrows, the javelins and spears; and they will make fires with them for seven years."
Ezekiel,39,10,"They will not take wood from the field nor cut down any from the forests, because they will make fires with the weapons; and they will plunder those who plundered them, and pillage those who pillaged them,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,39,11,"“It will come to pass in that day that I will give Gog a burial place there in Israel, the valley of those who pass by east of the sea; and it will obstruct travelers, because there they will bury Gog and all his multitude. Therefore they will call it the Valley of Hamon Gog."
Ezekiel,39,12,"For seven months the house of Israel will be burying them, in order to cleanse the land."
Ezekiel,39,13,"Indeed all the people of the land will be burying, and they will gain renown for it on the day that I am glorified,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,39,14,"“They will set apart men regularly employed, with the help of a search party, to pass through the land and bury those bodies remaining on the ground, in order to cleanse it. At the end of seven months they will make a search."
Ezekiel,39,15,"The search party will pass through the land; and when anyone sees a man’s bone, he shall set up a marker by it, till the buriers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon Gog."
Ezekiel,39,16,The name of the city will also be Hamonah. Thus they shall cleanse the land.”’
Ezekiel,39,17,"“And as for you, son of man, thus says the Lord GOD, ‘Speak to every sort of bird and to every beast of the field: “Assemble yourselves and come; Gather together from all sides to My sacrificial meal Which I am sacrificing for you, A great sacrificial meal on the mountains of Israel, That you may eat flesh and drink blood."
Ezekiel,39,18,"You shall eat the flesh of the mighty, Drink the blood of the princes of the earth, Of rams and lambs, Of goats and bulls, All of them fatlings of Bashan."
Ezekiel,39,19,"You shall eat fat till you are full, And drink blood till you are drunk, At My sacrificial meal Which I am sacrificing for you."
Ezekiel,39,20,"You shall be filled at My table With horses and riders, With mighty men And with all the men of war,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,39,21,"“I will set My glory among the nations; all the nations shall see My judgment which I have executed, and My hand which I have laid on them."
Ezekiel,39,22,So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God from that day forward.
Ezekiel,39,23,"The Gentiles shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity; because they were unfaithful to Me, therefore I hid My face from them. I gave them into the hand of their enemies, and they all fell by the sword."
Ezekiel,39,24,"According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions I have dealt with them, and hidden My face from them.”’"
Ezekiel,39,25,"“Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: ‘Now I will bring back the captives of Jacob, and have mercy on the whole house of Israel; and I will be jealous for My holy name—"
Ezekiel,39,26,"after they have borne their shame, and all their unfaithfulness in which they were unfaithful to Me, when they dwelt safely in their own land and no one made them afraid."
Ezekiel,39,27,"When I have brought them back from the peoples and gathered them out of their enemies’ lands, and I am hallowed in them in the sight of many nations,"
Ezekiel,39,28,"then they shall know that I am the LORD their God, who sent them into captivity among the nations, but also brought them back to their land, and left none of them captive any longer."
Ezekiel,39,29,"And I will not hide My face from them anymore; for I shall have poured out My Spirit on the house of Israel,’ says the Lord GOD.”"
Ezekiel,40,1,"In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was captured, on the very same day the hand of the LORD was upon me; and He took me there."
Ezekiel,40,2,In the visions of God He took me into the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain; on it toward the south was something like the structure of a city.
Ezekiel,40,3,"He took me there, and behold, there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze. He had a line of flax and a measuring rod in his hand, and he stood in the gateway."
Ezekiel,40,4,"And the man said to me, “Son of man, look with your eyes and hear with your ears, and fix your mind on everything I show you; for you were brought here so that I might show them to you. Declare to the house of Israel everything you see.”"
Ezekiel,40,5,"Now there was a wall all around the outside of the temple. In the man’s hand was a measuring rod six cubits long, each being a cubit and a handbreadth; and he measured the width of the wall structure, one rod; and the height, one rod."
Ezekiel,40,6,"Then he went to the gateway which faced east; and he went up its stairs and measured the threshold of the gateway, which was one rod wide, and the other threshold was one rod wide."
Ezekiel,40,7,Each gate chamber was one rod long and one rod wide; between the gate chambers was a space of five cubits; and the threshold of the gateway by the vestibule of the inside gate was one rod.
Ezekiel,40,8,"He also measured the vestibule of the inside gate, one rod."
Ezekiel,40,9,"Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway, eight cubits; and the gateposts, two cubits. The vestibule of the gate was on the inside."
Ezekiel,40,10,In the eastern gateway were three gate chambers on one side and three on the other; the three were all the same size; also the gateposts were of the same size on this side and that side.
Ezekiel,40,11,"He measured the width of the entrance to the gateway, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits."
Ezekiel,40,12,"There was a space in front of the gate chambers, one cubit on this side and one cubit on that side; the gate chambers were six cubits on this side and six cubits on that side."
Ezekiel,40,13,"Then he measured the gateway from the roof of one gate chamber to the roof of the other; the width was twenty-five cubits, as door faces door."
Ezekiel,40,14,"He measured the gateposts, sixty cubits high, and the court all around the gateway extended to the gatepost."
Ezekiel,40,15,From the front of the entrance gate to the front of the vestibule of the inner gate was fifty cubits.
Ezekiel,40,16,"There were beveled window frames in the gate chambers and in their intervening archways on the inside of the gateway all around, and likewise in the vestibules. There were windows all around on the inside. And on each gatepost were palm trees."
Ezekiel,40,17,Then he brought me into the outer court; and there were chambers and a pavement made all around the court; thirty chambers faced the pavement.
Ezekiel,40,18,"The pavement was by the side of the gateways, corresponding to the length of the gateways; this was the lower pavement."
Ezekiel,40,19,"Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gateway to the front of the inner court exterior, one hundred cubits toward the east and the north."
Ezekiel,40,20,"On the outer court was also a gateway facing north, and he measured its length and its width."
Ezekiel,40,21,"Its gate chambers, three on this side and three on that side, its gateposts and its archways, had the same measurements as the first gate; its length was fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits."
Ezekiel,40,22,"Its windows and those of its archways, and also its palm trees, had the same measurements as the gateway facing east; it was ascended by seven steps, and its archway was in front of it."
Ezekiel,40,23,"A gate of the inner court was opposite the northern gateway, just as the eastern gateway; and he measured from gateway to gateway, one hundred cubits."
Ezekiel,40,24,"After that he brought me toward the south, and there a gateway was facing south; and he measured its gateposts and archways according to these same measurements."
Ezekiel,40,25,There were windows in it and in its archways all around like those windows; its length was fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits.
Ezekiel,40,26,"Seven steps led up to it, and its archway was in front of them; and it had palm trees on its gateposts, one on this side and one on that side."
Ezekiel,40,27,"There was also a gateway on the inner court, facing south; and he measured from gateway to gateway toward the south, one hundred cubits."
Ezekiel,40,28,Then he brought me to the inner court through the southern gateway; he measured the southern gateway according to these same measurements.
Ezekiel,40,29,"Also its gate chambers, its gateposts, and its archways were according to these same measurements; there were windows in it and in its archways all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide."
Ezekiel,40,30,"There were archways all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide."
Ezekiel,40,31,"Its archways faced the outer court, palm trees were on its gateposts, and going up to it were eight steps."
Ezekiel,40,32,And he brought me into the inner court facing east; he measured the gateway according to these same measurements.
Ezekiel,40,33,"Also its gate chambers, its gateposts, and its archways were according to these same measurements; and there were windows in it and in its archways all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide."
Ezekiel,40,34,"Its archways faced the outer court, and palm trees were on its gateposts on this side and on that side; and going up to it were eight steps."
Ezekiel,40,35,Then he brought me to the north gateway and measured it according to these same measurements—
Ezekiel,40,36,"also its gate chambers, its gateposts, and its archways. It had windows all around; its length was fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits."
Ezekiel,40,37,"Its gateposts faced the outer court, palm trees were on its gateposts on this side and on that side, and going up to it were eight steps."
Ezekiel,40,38,"There was a chamber and its entrance by the gateposts of the gateway, where they washed the burnt offering."
Ezekiel,40,39,"In the vestibule of the gateway were two tables on this side and two tables on that side, on which to slay the burnt offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering."
Ezekiel,40,40,"At the outer side of the vestibule, as one goes up to the entrance of the northern gateway, were two tables; and on the other side of the vestibule of the gateway were two tables."
Ezekiel,40,41,"Four tables were on this side and four tables on that side, by the side of the gateway, eight tables on which they slaughtered the sacrifices."
Ezekiel,40,42,"There were also four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering, one cubit and a half long, one cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high; on these they laid the instruments with which they slaughtered the burnt offering and the sacrifice."
Ezekiel,40,43,"Inside were hooks, a handbreadth wide, fastened all around; and the flesh of the sacrifices was on the tables."
Ezekiel,40,44,"Outside the inner gate were the chambers for the singers in the inner court, one facing south at the side of the northern gateway, and the other facing north at the side of the southern gateway."
Ezekiel,40,45,"Then he said to me, “This chamber which faces south is for the priests who have charge of the temple."
Ezekiel,40,46,"The chamber which faces north is for the priests who have charge of the altar; these are the sons of Zadok, from the sons of Levi, who come near the LORD to minister to Him.”"
Ezekiel,40,47,"And he measured the court, one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits wide, foursquare. The altar was in front of the temple."
Ezekiel,40,48,"Then he brought me to the vestibule of the temple and measured the doorposts of the vestibule, five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side; and the width of the gateway was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side."
Ezekiel,40,49,"The length of the vestibule was twenty cubits, and the width eleven cubits; and by the steps which led up to it there were pillars by the doorposts, one on this side and another on that side."
Ezekiel,41,1,"Then he brought me into the sanctuary and measured the doorposts, six cubits wide on one side and six cubits wide on the other side—the width of the tabernacle."
Ezekiel,41,2,"The width of the entryway was ten cubits, and the side walls of the entrance were five cubits on this side and five cubits on the other side; and he measured its length, forty cubits, and its width, twenty cubits."
Ezekiel,41,3,"Also he went inside and measured the doorposts, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits high; and the width of the entrance, seven cubits."
Ezekiel,41,4,"He measured the length, twenty cubits; and the width, twenty cubits, beyond the sanctuary; and he said to me, “This is the Most Holy Place.”"
Ezekiel,41,5,"Next, he measured the wall of the temple, six cubits. The width of each side chamber all around the temple was four cubits on every side."
Ezekiel,41,6,"The side chambers were in three stories, one above the other, thirty chambers in each story; they rested on ledges which were for the side chambers all around, that they might be supported, but not fastened to the wall of the temple."
Ezekiel,41,7,"As one went up from story to story, the side chambers became wider all around, because their supporting ledges in the wall of the temple ascended like steps; therefore the width of the structure increased as one went up from the lowest story to the highest by way of the middle one."
Ezekiel,41,8,"I also saw an elevation all around the temple; it was the foundation of the side chambers, a full rod, that is, six cubits high."
Ezekiel,41,9,"The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits, and so also the remaining terrace by the place of the side chambers of the temple."
Ezekiel,41,10,And between it and the wall chambers was a width of twenty cubits all around the temple on every side.
Ezekiel,41,11,"The doors of the side chambers opened on the terrace, one door toward the north and another toward the south; and the width of the terrace was five cubits all around."
Ezekiel,41,12,"The building that faced the separating courtyard at its western end was seventy cubits wide; the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits."
Ezekiel,41,13,"So he measured the temple, one hundred cubits long; and the separating courtyard with the building and its walls was one hundred cubits long;"
Ezekiel,41,14,"also the width of the eastern face of the temple, including the separating courtyard, was one hundred cubits."
Ezekiel,41,15,"He measured the length of the building behind it, facing the separating courtyard, with its galleries on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits, as well as the inner temple and the porches of the court,"
Ezekiel,41,16,their doorposts and the beveled window frames. And the galleries all around their three stories opposite the threshold were paneled with wood from the ground to the windows—the windows were covered—
Ezekiel,41,17,"from the space above the door, even to the inner room, as well as outside, and on every wall all around, inside and outside, by measure."
Ezekiel,41,18,"And it was made with cherubim and palm trees, a palm tree between cherub and cherub. Each cherub had two faces,"
Ezekiel,41,19,"so that the face of a man was toward a palm tree on one side, and the face of a young lion toward a palm tree on the other side; thus it was made throughout the temple all around."
Ezekiel,41,20,"From the floor to the space above the door, and on the wall of the sanctuary, cherubim and palm trees were carved."
Ezekiel,41,21,"The doorposts of the temple were square, as was the front of the sanctuary; their appearance was similar."
Ezekiel,41,22,"The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits. Its corners, its length, and its sides were of wood; and he said to me, “This is the table that is before the LORD.”"
Ezekiel,41,23,The temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
Ezekiel,41,24,"The doors had two panels apiece, two folding panels: two panels for one door and two panels for the other door."
Ezekiel,41,25,Cherubim and palm trees were carved on the doors of the temple just as they were carved on the walls. A wooden canopy was on the front of the vestibule outside.
Ezekiel,41,26,"There were beveled window frames and palm trees on one side and on the other, on the sides of the vestibule—also on the side chambers of the temple and on the canopies."
Ezekiel,42,1,"Then he brought me out into the outer court, by the way toward the north; and he brought me into the chamber which was opposite the separating courtyard, and which was opposite the building toward the north."
Ezekiel,42,2,"Facing the length, which was one hundred cubits (the width was fifty cubits), was the north door."
Ezekiel,42,3,"Opposite the inner court of twenty cubits, and opposite the pavement of the outer court, was gallery against gallery in three stories."
Ezekiel,42,4,"In front of the chambers, toward the inside, was a walk ten cubits wide, at a distance of one cubit; and their doors faced north."
Ezekiel,42,5,"Now the upper chambers were shorter, because the galleries took away space from them more than from the lower and middle stories of the building."
Ezekiel,42,6,For they were in three stories and did not have pillars like the pillars of the courts; therefore the upper level was shortened more than the lower and middle levels from the ground up.
Ezekiel,42,7,"And a wall which was outside ran parallel to the chambers, at the front of the chambers, toward the outer court; its length was fifty cubits."
Ezekiel,42,8,"The length of the chambers toward the outer court was fifty cubits, whereas that facing the temple was one hundred cubits."
Ezekiel,42,9,"At the lower chambers was the entrance on the east side, as one goes into them from the outer court."
Ezekiel,42,10,"Also there were chambers in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, opposite the separating courtyard and opposite the building."
Ezekiel,42,11,"There was a walk in front of them also, and their appearance was like the chambers which were toward the north; they were as long and as wide as the others, and all their exits and entrances were according to plan."
Ezekiel,42,12,"And corresponding to the doors of the chambers that were facing south, as one enters them, there was a door in front of the walk, the way directly in front of the wall toward the east."
Ezekiel,42,13,"Then he said to me, “The north chambers and the south chambers, which are opposite the separating courtyard, are the holy chambers where the priests who approach the LORD shall eat the most holy offerings. There they shall lay the most holy offerings—the grain offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering—for the place is holy."
Ezekiel,42,14,"When the priests enter them, they shall not go out of the holy chamber into the outer court; but there they shall leave their garments in which they minister, for they are holy. They shall put on other garments; then they may approach that which is for the people.”"
Ezekiel,42,15,"Now when he had finished measuring the inner temple, he brought me out through the gateway that faces toward the east, and measured it all around."
Ezekiel,42,16,"He measured the east side with the measuring rod, five hundred rods by the measuring rod all around."
Ezekiel,42,17,"He measured the north side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod all around."
Ezekiel,42,18,"He measured the south side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod."
Ezekiel,42,19,He came around to the west side and measured five hundred rods by the measuring rod.
Ezekiel,42,20,"He measured it on the four sides; it had a wall all around, five hundred cubits long and five hundred wide, to separate the holy areas from the common."
Ezekiel,43,1,"Afterward he brought me to the gate, the gate that faces toward the east."
Ezekiel,43,2,"And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east. His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shone with His glory."
Ezekiel,43,3,It was like the appearance of the vision which I saw—like the vision which I saw when I came to destroy the city. The visions were like the vision which I saw by the River Chebar; and I fell on my face.
Ezekiel,43,4,And the glory of the LORD came into the temple by way of the gate which faces toward the east.
Ezekiel,43,5,"The Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the temple."
Ezekiel,43,6,"Then I heard Him speaking to me from the temple, while a man stood beside me."
Ezekiel,43,7,"And He said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of My throne and the place of the soles of My feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever. No more shall the house of Israel defile My holy name, they nor their kings, by their harlotry or with the carcasses of their kings on their high places."
Ezekiel,43,8,"When they set their threshold by My threshold, and their doorpost by My doorpost, with a wall between them and Me, they defiled My holy name by the abominations which they committed; therefore I have consumed them in My anger."
Ezekiel,43,9,"Now let them put their harlotry and the carcasses of their kings far away from Me, and I will dwell in their midst forever."
Ezekiel,43,10,"“Son of man, describe the temple to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern."
Ezekiel,43,11,"And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the temple and its arrangement, its exits and its entrances, its entire design and all its ordinances, all its forms and all its laws. Write it down in their sight, so that they may keep its whole design and all its ordinances, and perform them."
Ezekiel,43,12,"This is the law of the temple: The whole area surrounding the mountaintop is most holy. Behold, this is the law of the temple."
Ezekiel,43,13,"“These are the measurements of the altar in cubits (the cubit is one cubit and a handbreadth): the base one cubit high and one cubit wide, with a rim all around its edge of one span. This is the height of the altar:"
Ezekiel,43,14,"from the base on the ground to the lower ledge, two cubits; the width of the ledge, one cubit; from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge, four cubits; and the width of the ledge, one cubit."
Ezekiel,43,15,"The altar hearth is four cubits high, with four horns extending upward from the hearth."
Ezekiel,43,16,"The altar hearth is twelve cubits long, twelve wide, square at its four corners;"
Ezekiel,43,17,"the ledge, fourteen cubits long and fourteen wide on its four sides, with a rim of half a cubit around it; its base, one cubit all around; and its steps face toward the east.”"
Ezekiel,43,18,"And He said to me, “Son of man, thus says the Lord GOD: ‘These are the ordinances for the altar on the day when it is made, for sacrificing burnt offerings on it, and for sprinkling blood on it."
Ezekiel,43,19,"You shall give a young bull for a sin offering to the priests, the Levites, who are of the seed of Zadok, who approach Me to minister to Me,’ says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,43,20,"‘You shall take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar, on the four corners of the ledge, and on the rim around it; thus you shall cleanse it and make atonement for it."
Ezekiel,43,21,"Then you shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and burn it in the appointed place of the temple, outside the sanctuary."
Ezekiel,43,22,"On the second day you shall offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they cleansed it with the bull."
Ezekiel,43,23,"When you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a young bull without blemish, and a ram from the flock without blemish."
Ezekiel,43,24,"When you offer them before the LORD, the priests shall throw salt on them, and they will offer them up as a burnt offering to the LORD."
Ezekiel,43,25,"Every day for seven days you shall prepare a goat for a sin offering; they shall also prepare a young bull and a ram from the flock, both without blemish."
Ezekiel,43,26,"Seven days they shall make atonement for the altar and purify it, and so consecrate it."
Ezekiel,43,27,"When these days are over it shall be, on the eighth day and thereafter, that the priests shall offer your burnt offerings and your peace offerings on the altar; and I will accept you,’ says the Lord GOD.”"
Ezekiel,44,1,"Then He brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary which faces toward the east, but it was shut."
Ezekiel,44,2,"And the LORD said to me, “This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter by it, because the LORD God of Israel has entered by it; therefore it shall be shut."
Ezekiel,44,3,"As for the prince, because he is the prince, he may sit in it to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by way of the vestibule of the gateway, and go out the same way.”"
Ezekiel,44,4,"Also He brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple; so I looked, and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD; and I fell on my face."
Ezekiel,44,5,"And the LORD said to me, “Son of man, mark well, see with your eyes and hear with your ears, all that I say to you concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD and all its laws. Mark well who may enter the house and all who go out from the sanctuary."
Ezekiel,44,6,"“Now say to the rebellious, to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “O house of Israel, let Us have no more of all your abominations."
Ezekiel,44,7,"When you brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in My sanctuary to defile it—My house—and when you offered My food, the fat and the blood, then they broke My covenant because of all your abominations."
Ezekiel,44,8,"And you have not kept charge of My holy things, but you have set others to keep charge of My sanctuary for you.”"
Ezekiel,44,9,"Thus says the Lord GOD: “No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart or uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter My sanctuary, including any foreigner who is among the children of Israel."
Ezekiel,44,10,"“And the Levites who went far from Me, when Israel went astray, who strayed away from Me after their idols, they shall bear their iniquity."
Ezekiel,44,11,"Yet they shall be ministers in My sanctuary, as gatekeepers of the house and ministers of the house; they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them."
Ezekiel,44,12,"Because they ministered to them before their idols and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity, therefore I have raised My hand in an oath against them,” says the Lord GOD, “that they shall bear their iniquity."
Ezekiel,44,13,"And they shall not come near Me to minister to Me as priest, nor come near any of My holy things, nor into the Most Holy Place; but they shall bear their shame and their abominations which they have committed."
Ezekiel,44,14,"Nevertheless I will make them keep charge of the temple, for all its work, and for all that has to be done in it."
Ezekiel,44,15,"“But the priests, the Levites, the sons of Zadok, who kept charge of My sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from Me, they shall come near Me to minister to Me; and they shall stand before Me to offer to Me the fat and the blood,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,44,16,"“They shall enter My sanctuary, and they shall come near My table to minister to Me, and they shall keep My charge."
Ezekiel,44,17,"And it shall be, whenever they enter the gates of the inner court, that they shall put on linen garments; no wool shall come upon them while they minister within the gates of the inner court or within the house."
Ezekiel,44,18,They shall have linen turbans on their heads and linen trousers on their bodies; they shall not clothe themselves with anything that causes sweat.
Ezekiel,44,19,"When they go out to the outer court, to the outer court to the people, they shall take off their garments in which they have ministered, leave them in the holy chambers, and put on other garments; and in their holy garments they shall not sanctify the people."
Ezekiel,44,20,"“They shall neither shave their heads nor let their hair grow long, but they shall keep their hair well trimmed."

Ezekiel,44,23,"“And they shall teach My people the difference between the holy and the unholy, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean."
Ezekiel,44,24,"In controversy they shall stand as judges, and judge it according to My judgments. They shall keep My laws and My statutes in all My appointed meetings, and they shall hallow My Sabbaths."
Ezekiel,44,25,"“They shall not defile themselves by coming near a dead person. Only for father or mother, for son or daughter, for brother or unmarried sister may they defile themselves."
Ezekiel,44,26,"After he is cleansed, they shall count seven days for him."
Ezekiel,44,27,"And on the day that he goes to the sanctuary to minister in the sanctuary, he must offer his sin offering in the inner court,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,44,28,"“It shall be, in regard to their inheritance, that I am their inheritance. You shall give them no possession in Israel, for I am their possession."
Ezekiel,44,29,"They shall eat the grain offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering; every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs."
Ezekiel,44,30,"The best of all firstfruits of any kind, and every sacrifice of any kind from all your sacrifices, shall be the priest’s; also you shall give to the priest the first of your ground meal, to cause a blessing to rest on your house."
Ezekiel,44,31,"The priests shall not eat anything, bird or beast, that died naturally or was torn by wild beasts."
Ezekiel,45,1,"“Moreover, when you divide the land by lot into inheritance, you shall set apart a district for the LORD, a holy section of the land; its length shall be twenty-five thousand cubits, and the width ten thousand. It shall be holy throughout its territory all around."
Ezekiel,45,2,"Of this there shall be a square plot for the sanctuary, five hundred by five hundred rods, with fifty cubits around it for an open space."
Ezekiel,45,3,"So this is the district you shall measure: twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand wide; in it shall be the sanctuary, the Most Holy Place."
Ezekiel,45,4,"It shall be a holy section of the land, belonging to the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to minister to the LORD; it shall be a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary."
Ezekiel,45,5,"An area twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand wide shall belong to the Levites, the ministers of the temple; they shall have twenty chambers as a possession."

Ezekiel,45,8,"The land shall be his possession in Israel; and My princes shall no more oppress My people, but they shall give the rest of the land to the house of Israel, according to their tribes.”"
Ezekiel,45,9,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Enough, O princes of Israel! Remove violence and plundering, execute justice and righteousness, and stop dispossessing My people,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,45,10,"“You shall have honest scales, an honest ephah, and an honest bath."
Ezekiel,45,11,"The ephah and the bath shall be of the same measure, so that the bath contains one-tenth of a homer, and the ephah one-tenth of a homer; their measure shall be according to the homer."
Ezekiel,45,12,"The shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels, and fifteen shekels shall be your mina."
Ezekiel,45,13,"“This is the offering which you shall offer: you shall give one-sixth of an ephah from a homer of wheat, and one-sixth of an ephah from a homer of barley."
Ezekiel,45,14,"The ordinance concerning oil, the bath of oil, is one-tenth of a bath from a kor. A kor is a homer or ten baths, for ten baths are a homer."
Ezekiel,45,15,"And one lamb shall be given from a flock of two hundred, from the rich pastures of Israel. These shall be for grain offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings, to make atonement for them,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,45,16,“All the people of the land shall give this offering for the prince in Israel.
Ezekiel,45,17,"Then it shall be the prince’s part to give burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings, at the feasts, the New Moons, the Sabbaths, and at all the appointed seasons of the house of Israel. He shall prepare the sin offering, the grain offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings to make atonement for the house of Israel.”"
Ezekiel,45,18,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “In the first month, on the first day of the month, you shall take a young bull without blemish and cleanse the sanctuary."
Ezekiel,45,19,"The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the temple, on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the gateposts of the gate of the inner court."
Ezekiel,45,20,And so you shall do on the seventh day of the month for everyone who has sinned unintentionally or in ignorance. Thus you shall make atonement for the temple.
Ezekiel,45,21,"“In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you shall observe the Passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten."
Ezekiel,45,22,And on that day the prince shall prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bull for a sin offering.
Ezekiel,45,23,"On the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the LORD, seven bulls and seven rams without blemish, daily for seven days, and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering."
Ezekiel,45,24,"And he shall prepare a grain offering of one ephah for each bull and one ephah for each ram, together with a hin of oil for each ephah."
Ezekiel,45,25,"“In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, at the feast, he shall do likewise for seven days, according to the sin offering, the burnt offering, the grain offering, and the oil.”"
Ezekiel,46,1,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “The gateway of the inner court that faces toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the Sabbath it shall be opened, and on the day of the New Moon it shall be opened."
Ezekiel,46,2,"The prince shall enter by way of the vestibule of the gateway from the outside, and stand by the gatepost. The priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings. He shall worship at the threshold of the gate. Then he shall go out, but the gate shall not be shut until evening."
Ezekiel,46,3,Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the entrance to this gateway before the LORD on the Sabbaths and the New Moons.
Ezekiel,46,4,"The burnt offering that the prince offers to the LORD on the Sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish;"
Ezekiel,46,5,"and the grain offering shall be one ephah for a ram, and the grain offering for the lambs, as much as he wants to give, as well as a hin of oil with every ephah."
Ezekiel,46,6,"On the day of the New Moon it shall be a young bull without blemish, six lambs, and a ram; they shall be without blemish."
Ezekiel,46,7,"He shall prepare a grain offering of an ephah for a bull, an ephah for a ram, as much as he wants to give for the lambs, and a hin of oil with every ephah."
Ezekiel,46,8,"When the prince enters, he shall go in by way of the vestibule of the gateway, and go out the same way."
Ezekiel,46,9,"“But when the people of the land come before the LORD on the appointed feast days, whoever enters by way of the north gate to worship shall go out by way of the south gate; and whoever enters by way of the south gate shall go out by way of the north gate. He shall not return by way of the gate through which he came, but shall go out through the opposite gate."
Ezekiel,46,10,"The prince shall then be in their midst. When they go in, he shall go in; and when they go out, he shall go out."
Ezekiel,46,11,"At the festivals and the appointed feast days the grain offering shall be an ephah for a bull, an ephah for a ram, as much as he wants to give for the lambs, and a hin of oil with every ephah."
Ezekiel,46,12,"“Now when the prince makes a voluntary burnt offering or voluntary peace offering to the LORD, the gate that faces toward the east shall then be opened for him; and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he did on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and after he goes out the gate shall be shut."
Ezekiel,46,13,“You shall daily make a burnt offering to the LORD of a lamb of the first year without blemish; you shall prepare it every morning.
Ezekiel,46,14,"And you shall prepare a grain offering with it every morning, a sixth of an ephah, and a third of a hin of oil to moisten the fine flour. This grain offering is a perpetual ordinance, to be made regularly to the LORD."
Ezekiel,46,15,"Thus they shall prepare the lamb, the grain offering, and the oil, as a regular burnt offering every morning.”"
Ezekiel,46,16,"‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “If the prince gives a gift of some of his inheritance to any of his sons, it shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance."
Ezekiel,46,17,"But if he gives a gift of some of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his until the year of liberty, after which it shall return to the prince. But his inheritance shall belong to his sons; it shall become theirs."
Ezekiel,46,18,"Moreover the prince shall not take any of the people’s inheritance by evicting them from their property; he shall provide an inheritance for his sons from his own property, so that none of My people may be scattered from his property.”’”"
Ezekiel,46,19,"Now he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests which face toward the north; and there a place was situated at their extreme western end."
Ezekiel,46,20,"And he said to me, “This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the grain offering, so that they do not bring them out into the outer court to sanctify the people.”"
Ezekiel,46,21,"Then he brought me out into the outer court and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and in fact, in every corner of the court there was another court."
Ezekiel,46,22,"In the four corners of the court were enclosed courts, forty cubits long and thirty wide; all four corners were the same size."
Ezekiel,46,23,"There was a row of building stones all around in them, all around the four of them; and cooking hearths were made under the rows of stones all around."
Ezekiel,46,24,"And he said to me, “These are the kitchens where the ministers of the temple shall boil the sacrifices of the people.”"
Ezekiel,47,1,"Then he brought me back to the door of the temple; and there was water, flowing from under the threshold of the temple toward the east, for the front of the temple faced east; the water was flowing from under the right side of the temple, south of the altar."
Ezekiel,47,2,"He brought me out by way of the north gate, and led me around on the outside to the outer gateway that faces east; and there was water, running out on the right side."
Ezekiel,47,3,"And when the man went out to the east with the line in his hand, he measured one thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the water came up to my ankles."
Ezekiel,47,4,Again he measured one thousand and brought me through the waters; the water came up to my knees. Again he measured one thousand and brought me through; the water came up to my waist.
Ezekiel,47,5,"Again he measured one thousand, and it was a river that I could not cross; for the water was too deep, water in which one must swim, a river that could not be crossed."
Ezekiel,47,6,"He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen this?” Then he brought me and returned me to the bank of the river."
Ezekiel,47,7,"When I returned, there, along the bank of the river, were very many trees on one side and the other."
Ezekiel,47,8,"Then he said to me: “This water flows toward the eastern region, goes down into the valley, and enters the sea. When it reaches the sea, its waters are healed."
Ezekiel,47,9,"And it shall be that every living thing that moves, wherever the rivers go, will live. There will be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters go there; for they will be healed, and everything will live wherever the river goes."
Ezekiel,47,10,"It shall be that fishermen will stand by it from En Gedi to En Eglaim; they will be places for spreading their nets. Their fish will be of the same kinds as the fish of the Great Sea, exceedingly many."
Ezekiel,47,11,But its swamps and marshes will not be healed; they will be given over to salt.
Ezekiel,47,12,"Along the bank of the river, on this side and that, will grow all kinds of trees used for food; their leaves will not wither, and their fruit will not fail. They will bear fruit every month, because their water flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for medicine.”"
Ezekiel,47,13,Thus says the Lord GOD: “These are the borders by which you shall divide the land as an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph shall have two portions.
Ezekiel,47,14,"You shall inherit it equally with one another; for I raised My hand in an oath to give it to your fathers, and this land shall fall to you as your inheritance."
Ezekiel,47,15,"“This shall be the border of the land on the north: from the Great Sea, by the road to Hethlon, as one goes to Zedad,"
Ezekiel,47,16,"Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim (which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath), to Hazar Hatticon (which is on the border of Hauran)."
Ezekiel,47,17,"Thus the boundary shall be from the Sea to Hazar Enan, the border of Damascus; and as for the north, northward, it is the border of Hamath. This is the north side."
Ezekiel,47,18,"“On the east side you shall mark out the border from between Hauran and Damascus, and between Gilead and the land of Israel, along the Jordan, and along the eastern side of the sea. This is the east side."
Ezekiel,47,19,"“The south side, toward the South, shall be from Tamar to the waters of Meribah by Kadesh, along the brook to the Great Sea. This is the south side, toward the South."
Ezekiel,47,20,"“The west side shall be the Great Sea, from the southern boundary until one comes to a point opposite Hamath. This is the west side."
Ezekiel,47,21,“Thus you shall divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.
Ezekiel,47,22,"It shall be that you will divide it by lot as an inheritance for yourselves, and for the strangers who dwell among you and who bear children among you. They shall be to you as native-born among the children of Israel; they shall have an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel."
Ezekiel,47,23,"And it shall be that in whatever tribe the stranger dwells, there you shall give him his inheritance,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,48,1,"“Now these are the names of the tribes: From the northern border along the road to Hethlon at the entrance of Hamath, to Hazar Enan, the border of Damascus northward, in the direction of Hamath, there shall be one section for Dan from its east to its west side;"
Ezekiel,48,2,"by the border of Dan, from the east side to the west, one section for Asher;"
Ezekiel,48,3,"by the border of Asher, from the east side to the west, one section for Naphtali;"

Ezekiel,48,7,"by the border of Reuben, from the east side to the west, one section for Judah;"
Ezekiel,48,8,"by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west, shall be the district which you shall set apart, twenty-five thousand cubits in width, and in length the same as one of the other portions, from the east side to the west, with the sanctuary in the center."
Ezekiel,48,9,“The district that you shall set apart for the LORD shall be twenty-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand in width.
Ezekiel,48,10,"To these—to the priests—the holy district shall belong: on the north twenty-five thousand cubits in length, on the west ten thousand in width, on the east ten thousand in width, and on the south twenty-five thousand in length. The sanctuary of the LORD shall be in the center."
Ezekiel,48,11,"It shall be for the priests of the sons of Zadok, who are sanctified, who have kept My charge, who did not go astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray."
Ezekiel,48,12,And this district of land that is set apart shall be to them a thing most holy by the border of the Levites.
Ezekiel,48,13,"“Opposite the border of the priests, the Levites shall have an area twenty-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand in width; its entire length shall be twenty-five thousand and its width ten thousand."
Ezekiel,48,14,"And they shall not sell or exchange any of it; they may not alienate this best part of the land, for it is holy to the LORD."
Ezekiel,48,15,"“The five thousand cubits in width that remain, along the edge of the twenty-five thousand, shall be for general use by the city, for dwellings and common-land; and the city shall be in the center."
Ezekiel,48,16,"These shall be its measurements: the north side four thousand five hundred cubits, the south side four thousand five hundred, the east side four thousand five hundred, and the west side four thousand five hundred."
Ezekiel,48,17,"The common-land of the city shall be: to the north two hundred and fifty cubits, to the south two hundred and fifty, to the east two hundred and fifty, and to the west two hundred and fifty."
Ezekiel,48,18,"The rest of the length, alongside the district of the holy section, shall be ten thousand cubits to the east and ten thousand to the west. It shall be adjacent to the district of the holy section, and its produce shall be food for the workers of the city."
Ezekiel,48,19,"The workers of the city, from all the tribes of Israel, shall cultivate it."
Ezekiel,48,20,"The entire district shall be twenty-five thousand cubits by twenty-five thousand cubits, foursquare. You shall set apart the holy district with the property of the city."
Ezekiel,48,21,"“The rest shall belong to the prince, on one side and on the other of the holy district and of the city’s property, next to the twenty-five thousand cubits of the holy district as far as the eastern border, and westward next to the twenty-five thousand as far as the western border, adjacent to the tribal portions; it shall belong to the prince. It shall be the holy district, and the sanctuary of the temple shall be in the center."
Ezekiel,48,22,"Moreover, apart from the possession of the Levites and the possession of the city which are in the midst of what belongs to the prince, the area between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin shall belong to the prince."
Ezekiel,48,23,"“As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side to the west, Benjamin shall have one section;"
Ezekiel,48,24,"by the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the west, Simeon shall have one section;"

Ezekiel,48,29,"This is the land which you shall divide by lot as an inheritance among the tribes of Israel, and these are their portions,” says the Lord GOD."
Ezekiel,48,30,"“These are the exits of the city. On the north side, measuring four thousand five hundred cubits"
Ezekiel,48,31,"(the gates of the city shall be named after the tribes of Israel), the three gates northward: one gate for Reuben, one gate for Judah, and one gate for Levi;"
Ezekiel,48,32,"on the east side, four thousand five hundred cubits, three gates: one gate for Joseph, one gate for Benjamin, and one gate for Dan;"
Ezekiel,48,33,"on the south side, measuring four thousand five hundred cubits, three gates: one gate for Simeon, one gate for Issachar, and one gate for Zebulun;"
Ezekiel,48,34,"on the west side, four thousand five hundred cubits with their three gates: one gate for Gad, one gate for Asher, and one gate for Naphtali."
Ezekiel,48,35,All the way around shall be eighteen thousand cubits; and the name of the city from that day shall be: THE LORD IS THERE.”
Daniel,1,1,"In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it."
Daniel,1,2,"And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with some of the articles of the house of God, which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the articles into the treasure house of his god."
Daniel,1,3,"Then the king instructed Ashpenaz, the master of his eunuchs, to bring some of the children of Israel and some of the king’s descendants and some of the nobles,"
Daniel,1,4,"young men in whom there was no blemish, but good-looking, gifted in all wisdom, possessing knowledge and quick to understand, who had ability to serve in the king’s palace, and whom they might teach the language and literature of the Chaldeans."
Daniel,1,5,"And the king appointed for them a daily provision of the king’s delicacies and of the wine which he drank, and three years of training for them, so that at the end of that time they might serve before the king."
Daniel,1,6,"Now from among those of the sons of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah."
Daniel,1,7,"To them the chief of the eunuchs gave names: he gave Daniel the name Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abed-Nego."
Daniel,1,8,"But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s delicacies, nor with the wine which he drank; therefore he requested of the chief of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself."
Daniel,1,9,Now God had brought Daniel into the favor and goodwill of the chief of the eunuchs.
Daniel,1,10,"And the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, “I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and drink. For why should he see your faces looking worse than the young men who are your age? Then you would endanger my head before the king.”"
Daniel,1,11,"So Daniel said to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,"
Daniel,1,12,"“Please test your servants for ten days, and let them give us vegetables to eat and water to drink."
Daniel,1,13,"Then let our appearance be examined before you, and the appearance of the young men who eat the portion of the king’s delicacies; and as you see fit, so deal with your servants.”"
Daniel,1,14,"So he consented with them in this matter, and tested them ten days."
Daniel,1,15,And at the end of ten days their features appeared better and fatter in flesh than all the young men who ate the portion of the king’s delicacies.
Daniel,1,16,"Thus the steward took away their portion of delicacies and the wine that they were to drink, and gave them vegetables."
Daniel,1,17,"As for these four young men, God gave them knowledge and skill in all literature and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams."
Daniel,1,18,"Now at the end of the days, when the king had said that they should be brought in, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar."
Daniel,1,19,"Then the king interviewed them, and among them all none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore they served before the king."
Daniel,1,20,"And in all matters of wisdom and understanding about which the king examined them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers who were in all his realm."
Daniel,1,21,Thus Daniel continued until the first year of King Cyrus.
Daniel,2,1,"Now in the second year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; and his spirit was so troubled that his sleep left him."
Daniel,2,2,"Then the king gave the command to call the magicians, the astrologers, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king."
Daniel,2,3,"And the king said to them, “I have had a dream, and my spirit is anxious to know the dream.”"
Daniel,2,4,"Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic, “O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will give the interpretation.”"
Daniel,2,5,"The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, “My decision is firm: if you do not make known the dream to me, and its interpretation, you shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made an ash heap."
Daniel,2,6,"However, if you tell the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts, rewards, and great honor. Therefore tell me the dream and its interpretation.”"
Daniel,2,7,"They answered again and said, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will give its interpretation.”"
Daniel,2,8,"The king answered and said, “I know for certain that you would gain time, because you see that my decision is firm:"
Daniel,2,9,"if you do not make known the dream to me, there is only one decree for you! For you have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me till the time has changed. Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can give me its interpretation.”"
Daniel,2,10,"The Chaldeans answered the king, and said, “There is not a man on earth who can tell the king’s matter; therefore no king, lord, or ruler has ever asked such things of any magician, astrologer, or Chaldean."
Daniel,2,11,"It is a difficult thing that the king requests, and there is no other who can tell it to the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.”"
Daniel,2,12,"For this reason the king was angry and very furious, and gave the command to destroy all the wise men of Babylon."
Daniel,2,13,"So the decree went out, and they began killing the wise men; and they sought Daniel and his companions, to kill them."
Daniel,2,14,"Then with counsel and wisdom Daniel answered Arioch, the captain of the king’s guard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon;"
Daniel,2,15,"he answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, “Why is the decree from the king so urgent?” Then Arioch made the decision known to Daniel."
Daniel,2,16,"So Daniel went in and asked the king to give him time, that he might tell the king the interpretation."
Daniel,2,17,"Then Daniel went to his house, and made the decision known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions,"
Daniel,2,18,"that they might seek mercies from the God of heaven concerning this secret, so that Daniel and his companions might not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon."
Daniel,2,19,Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a night vision. So Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
Daniel,2,20,"Daniel answered and said: “Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, For wisdom and might are His."
Daniel,2,21,And He changes the times and the seasons; He removes kings and raises up kings; He gives wisdom to the wise And knowledge to those who have understanding.
Daniel,2,22,"He reveals deep and secret things; He knows what is in the darkness, And light dwells with Him."
Daniel,2,23,"“I thank You and praise You, O God of my fathers; You have given me wisdom and might, And have now made known to me what we asked of You, For You have made known to us the king’s demand.”"
Daniel,2,24,"Therefore Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went and said thus to him: “Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon; take me before the king, and I will tell the king the interpretation.”"
Daniel,2,25,"Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king, and said thus to him, “I have found a man of the captives of Judah, who will make known to the king the interpretation.”"
Daniel,2,26,"The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?”"
Daniel,2,27,"Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, “The secret which the king has demanded, the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, and the soothsayers cannot declare to the king."
Daniel,2,28,"But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head upon your bed, were these:"
Daniel,2,29,"As for you, O king, thoughts came to your mind while on your bed, about what would come to pass after this; and He who reveals secrets has made known to you what will be."
Daniel,2,30,"But as for me, this secret has not been revealed to me because I have more wisdom than anyone living, but for our sakes who make known the interpretation to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your heart."
Daniel,2,31,"“You, O king, were watching; and behold, a great image! This great image, whose splendor was excellent, stood before you; and its form was awesome."
Daniel,2,32,"This image’s head was of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze,"
Daniel,2,33,"its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay."
Daniel,2,34,"You watched while a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces."
Daniel,2,35,"Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed together, and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; the wind carried them away so that no trace of them was found. And the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth."
Daniel,2,36,“This is the dream. Now we will tell the interpretation of it before the king.
Daniel,2,37,"You, O king, are a king of kings. For the God of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, strength, and glory;"
Daniel,2,38,"and wherever the children of men dwell, or the beasts of the field and the birds of the heaven, He has given them into your hand, and has made you ruler over them all—you are this head of gold."
Daniel,2,39,"But after you shall arise another kingdom inferior to yours; then another, a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth."
Daniel,2,40,"And the fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron, inasmuch as iron breaks in pieces and shatters everything; and like iron that crushes, that kingdom will break in pieces and crush all the others."
Daniel,2,41,"Whereas you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter’s clay and partly of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; yet the strength of the iron shall be in it, just as you saw the iron mixed with ceramic clay."
Daniel,2,42,"And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly fragile."
Daniel,2,43,"As you saw iron mixed with ceramic clay, they will mingle with the seed of men; but they will not adhere to one another, just as iron does not mix with clay."
Daniel,2,44,"And in the days of these kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people; it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever."
Daniel,2,45,"Inasmuch as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold—the great God has made known to the king what will come to pass after this. The dream is certain, and its interpretation is sure.”"
Daniel,2,46,"Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, prostrate before Daniel, and commanded that they should present an offering and incense to him."
Daniel,2,47,"The king answered Daniel, and said, “Truly your God is the God of gods, the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, since you could reveal this secret.”"
Daniel,2,48,"Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts; and he made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief administrator over all the wise men of Babylon."
Daniel,2,49,"Also Daniel petitioned the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego over the affairs of the province of Babylon; but Daniel sat in the gate of the king."
Daniel,3,1,"Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits and its width six cubits. He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon."
Daniel,3,2,"And King Nebuchadnezzar sent word to gather together the satraps, the administrators, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up."
Daniel,3,3,"So the satraps, the administrators, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces gathered together for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up."
Daniel,3,4,"Then a herald cried aloud: “To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages,"
Daniel,3,5,"that at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, and psaltery, in symphony with all kinds of music, you shall fall down and worship the gold image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up;"
Daniel,3,6,and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast immediately into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.”
Daniel,3,7,"So at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the horn, flute, harp, and lyre, in symphony with all kinds of music, all the people, nations, and languages fell down and worshiped the gold image which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up."
Daniel,3,8,Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and accused the Jews.
Daniel,3,9,"They spoke and said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “O king, live forever!"
Daniel,3,10,"You, O king, have made a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, and psaltery, in symphony with all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the gold image;"
Daniel,3,11,and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
Daniel,3,12,"There are certain Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego; these men, O king, have not paid due regard to you. They do not serve your gods or worship the gold image which you have set up.”"
Daniel,3,13,"Then Nebuchadnezzar, in rage and fury, gave the command to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. So they brought these men before the king."
Daniel,3,14,"Nebuchadnezzar spoke, saying to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the gold image which I have set up?"
Daniel,3,15,"Now if you are ready at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, and psaltery, in symphony with all kinds of music, and you fall down and worship the image which I have made, good! But if you do not worship, you shall be cast immediately into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. And who is the god who will deliver you from my hands?”"
Daniel,3,16,"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego answered and said to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter."
Daniel,3,17,"If that is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king."
Daniel,3,18,"But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up.”"
Daniel,3,19,"Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury, and the expression on his face changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. He spoke and commanded that they heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated."
Daniel,3,20,"And he commanded certain mighty men of valor who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, and cast them into the burning fiery furnace."
Daniel,3,21,"Then these men were bound in their coats, their trousers, their turbans, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace."
Daniel,3,22,"Therefore, because the king’s command was urgent, and the furnace exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego."
Daniel,3,23,"And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace."
Daniel,3,24,"Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished; and he rose in haste and spoke, saying to his counselors, “Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?” They answered and said to the king, “True, O king.”"
Daniel,3,25,"“Look!” he answered, “I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire; and they are not hurt, and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.”"
Daniel,3,26,"Then Nebuchadnezzar went near the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and spoke, saying, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, servants of the Most High God, come out, and come here.” Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego came from the midst of the fire."
Daniel,3,27,"And the satraps, administrators, governors, and the king’s counselors gathered together, and they saw these men on whose bodies the fire had no power; the hair of their head was not singed nor were their garments affected, and the smell of fire was not on them."
Daniel,3,28,"Nebuchadnezzar spoke, saying, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, who sent His Angel and delivered His servants who trusted in Him, and they have frustrated the king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that they should not serve nor worship any god except their own God!"
Daniel,3,29,"Therefore I make a decree that any people, nation, or language which speaks anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made an ash heap; because there is no other God who can deliver like this.”"
Daniel,3,30,"Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego in the province of Babylon."
Daniel,4,1,"Nebuchadnezzar the king, To all peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you."
Daniel,4,2,I thought it good to declare the signs and wonders that the Most High God has worked for me.
Daniel,4,3,"How great are His signs, And how mighty His wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, And His dominion is from generation to generation."
Daniel,4,4,"I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace."
Daniel,4,5,"I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me."
Daniel,4,6,"Therefore I issued a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream."
Daniel,4,7,"Then the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers came in, and I told them the dream; but they did not make known to me its interpretation."
Daniel,4,8,"But at last Daniel came before me (his name is Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god; in him is the Spirit of the Holy God), and I told the dream before him, saying:"
Daniel,4,9,"“Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, because I know that the Spirit of the Holy God is in you, and no secret troubles you, explain to me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and its interpretation."
Daniel,4,10,"“These were the visions of my head while on my bed: I was looking, and behold, A tree in the midst of the earth, And its height was great."
Daniel,4,11,"The tree grew and became strong; Its height reached to the heavens, And it could be seen to the ends of all the earth."
Daniel,4,12,"Its leaves were lovely, Its fruit abundant, And in it was food for all. The beasts of the field found shade under it, The birds of the heavens dwelt in its branches, And all flesh was fed from it."
Daniel,4,13,"“I saw in the visions of my head while on my bed, and there was a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven."
Daniel,4,14,"He cried aloud and said thus: ‘Chop down the tree and cut off its branches, Strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the beasts get out from under it, And the birds from its branches."
Daniel,4,15,"Nevertheless leave the stump and roots in the earth, Bound with a band of iron and bronze, In the tender grass of the field. Let it be wet with the dew of heaven, And let him graze with the beasts On the grass of the earth."
Daniel,4,16,"Let his heart be changed from that of a man, Let him be given the heart of a beast, And let seven times pass over him."
Daniel,4,17,"‘This decision is by the decree of the watchers, And the sentence by the word of the holy ones, In order that the living may know That the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, Gives it to whomever He will, And sets over it the lowest of men.’"
Daniel,4,18,"“This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen. Now you, Belteshazzar, declare its interpretation, since all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation; but you are able, for the Spirit of the Holy God is in you.”"
Daniel,4,19,"Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonished for a time, and his thoughts troubled him. So the king spoke, and said, “Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its interpretation trouble you.” Belteshazzar answered and said, “My lord, may the dream concern those who hate you, and its interpretation concern your enemies!"
Daniel,4,20,"“The tree that you saw, which grew and became strong, whose height reached to the heavens and which could be seen by all the earth,"
Daniel,4,21,"whose leaves were lovely and its fruit abundant, in which was food for all, under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and in whose branches the birds of the heaven had their home—"
Daniel,4,22,"it is you, O king, who have grown and become strong; for your greatness has grown and reaches to the heavens, and your dominion to the end of the earth."
Daniel,4,23,"“And inasmuch as the king saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, ‘Chop down the tree and destroy it, but leave its stump and roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze in the tender grass of the field; let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let him graze with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him’;"
Daniel,4,24,"this is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king:"
Daniel,4,25,"They shall drive you from men, your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make you eat grass like oxen. They shall wet you with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over you, till you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever He chooses."
Daniel,4,26,"“And inasmuch as they gave the command to leave the stump and roots of the tree, your kingdom shall be assured to you, after you come to know that Heaven rules."
Daniel,4,27,"Therefore, O king, let my advice be acceptable to you; break off your sins by being righteous, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor. Perhaps there may be a lengthening of your prosperity.”"
Daniel,4,28,All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar.
Daniel,4,29,At the end of the twelve months he was walking about the royal palace of Babylon.
Daniel,4,30,"The king spoke, saying, “Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for a royal dwelling by my mighty power and for the honor of my majesty?”"
Daniel,4,31,"While the word was still in the king’s mouth, a voice fell from heaven: “King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: the kingdom has departed from you!"
Daniel,4,32,"And they shall drive you from men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. They shall make you eat grass like oxen; and seven times shall pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever He chooses.”"
Daniel,4,33,That very hour the word was fulfilled concerning Nebuchadnezzar; he was driven from men and ate grass like oxen; his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hair had grown like eagles’ feathers and his nails like birds’ claws.
Daniel,4,34,"And at the end of the time I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me; and I blessed the Most High and praised and honored Him who lives forever: For His dominion is an everlasting dominion, And His kingdom is from generation to generation."
Daniel,4,35,"All the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; He does according to His will in the army of heaven And among the inhabitants of the earth. No one can restrain His hand Or say to Him, “What have You done?”"
Daniel,4,36,"At the same time my reason returned to me, and for the glory of my kingdom, my honor and splendor returned to me. My counselors and nobles resorted to me, I was restored to my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added to me."
Daniel,4,37,"Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, all of whose works are truth, and His ways justice. And those who walk in pride He is able to put down."
Daniel,5,1,"Belshazzar the king made a great feast for a thousand of his lords, and drank wine in the presence of the thousand."
Daniel,5,2,"While he tasted the wine, Belshazzar gave the command to bring the gold and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple which had been in Jerusalem, that the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines might drink from them."
Daniel,5,3,"Then they brought the gold vessels that had been taken from the temple of the house of God which had been in Jerusalem; and the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines drank from them."
Daniel,5,4,"They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze and iron, wood and stone."
Daniel,5,5,In the same hour the fingers of a man’s hand appeared and wrote opposite the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace; and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.
Daniel,5,6,"Then the king’s countenance changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his hips were loosened and his knees knocked against each other."
Daniel,5,7,"The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. The king spoke, saying to the wise men of Babylon, “Whoever reads this writing, and tells me its interpretation, shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold around his neck; and he shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.”"
Daniel,5,8,"Now all the king’s wise men came, but they could not read the writing, or make known to the king its interpretation."
Daniel,5,9,"Then King Belshazzar was greatly troubled, his countenance was changed, and his lords were astonished."
Daniel,5,10,"The queen, because of the words of the king and his lords, came to the banquet hall. The queen spoke, saying, “O king, live forever! Do not let your thoughts trouble you, nor let your countenance change."
Daniel,5,11,"There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the Spirit of the Holy God. And in the days of your father, light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him; and King Nebuchadnezzar your father—your father the king—made him chief of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers."
Daniel,5,12,"Inasmuch as an excellent spirit, knowledge, understanding, interpreting dreams, solving riddles, and explaining enigmas were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar, now let Daniel be called, and he will give the interpretation.”"
Daniel,5,13,"Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king spoke, and said to Daniel, “Are you that Daniel who is one of the captives from Judah, whom my father the king brought from Judah?"
Daniel,5,14,"I have heard of you, that the Spirit of God is in you, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you."
Daniel,5,15,"Now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing and make known to me its interpretation, but they could not give the interpretation of the thing."
Daniel,5,16,"And I have heard of you, that you can give interpretations and explain enigmas. Now if you can read the writing and make known to me its interpretation, you shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold around your neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.”"
Daniel,5,17,"Then Daniel answered, and said before the king, “Let your gifts be for yourself, and give your rewards to another; yet I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation."
Daniel,5,18,"O king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father a kingdom and majesty, glory and honor."
Daniel,5,19,"And because of the majesty that He gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him. Whomever he wished, he executed; whomever he wished, he kept alive; whomever he wished, he set up; and whomever he wished, he put down."
Daniel,5,20,"But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him."
Daniel,5,21,"Then he was driven from the sons of men, his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. They fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till he knew that the Most High God rules in the kingdom of men, and appoints over it whomever He chooses."
Daniel,5,22,"“But you his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, although you knew all this."
Daniel,5,23,"And you have lifted yourself up against the Lord of heaven. They have brought the vessels of His house before you, and you and your lords, your wives and your concubines, have drunk wine from them. And you have praised the gods of silver and gold, bronze and iron, wood and stone, which do not see or hear or know; and the God who holds your breath in His hand and owns all your ways, you have not glorified."
Daniel,5,24,"Then the fingers of the hand were sent from Him, and this writing was written."
Daniel,5,25,"“And this is the inscription that was written: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN."
Daniel,5,26,"This is the interpretation of each word. MENE: God has numbered your kingdom, and finished it;"
Daniel,5,27,"TEKEL: You have been weighed in the balances, and found wanting;"
Daniel,5,28,"PERES: Your kingdom has been divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.”"
Daniel,5,29,"Then Belshazzar gave the command, and they clothed Daniel with purple and put a chain of gold around his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom."
Daniel,5,30,"That very night Belshazzar, king of the Chaldeans, was slain."
Daniel,5,31,"And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old."
Daniel,6,1,"It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom one hundred and twenty satraps, to be over the whole kingdom;"
Daniel,6,2,"and over these, three governors, of whom Daniel was one, that the satraps might give account to them, so that the king would suffer no loss."
Daniel,6,3,"Then this Daniel distinguished himself above the governors and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king gave thought to setting him over the whole realm."
Daniel,6,4,"So the governors and satraps sought to find some charge against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find no charge or fault, because he was faithful; nor was there any error or fault found in him."
Daniel,6,5,"Then these men said, “We shall not find any charge against this Daniel unless we find it against him concerning the law of his God.”"
Daniel,6,6,"So these governors and satraps thronged before the king, and said thus to him: “King Darius, live forever!"
Daniel,6,7,"All the governors of the kingdom, the administrators and satraps, the counselors and advisors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute and to make a firm decree, that whoever petitions any god or man for thirty days, except you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions."
Daniel,6,8,"Now, O king, establish the decree and sign the writing, so that it cannot be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which does not alter.”"
Daniel,6,9,Therefore King Darius signed the written decree.
Daniel,6,10,"Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went home. And in his upper room, with his windows open toward Jerusalem, he knelt down on his knees three times that day, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as was his custom since early days."
Daniel,6,11,Then these men assembled and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.
Daniel,6,12,"And they went before the king, and spoke concerning the king’s decree: “Have you not signed a decree that every man who petitions any god or man within thirty days, except you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?” The king answered and said, “The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which does not alter.”"
Daniel,6,13,"So they answered and said before the king, “That Daniel, who is one of the captives from Judah, does not show due regard for you, O king, or for the decree that you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.”"
Daniel,6,14,"And the king, when he heard these words, was greatly displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he labored till the going down of the sun to deliver him."
Daniel,6,15,"Then these men approached the king, and said to the king, “Know, O king, that it is the law of the Medes and Persians that no decree or statute which the king establishes may be changed.”"
Daniel,6,16,"So the king gave the command, and they brought Daniel and cast him into the den of lions. But the king spoke, saying to Daniel, “Your God, whom you serve continually, He will deliver you.”"
Daniel,6,17,"Then a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signets of his lords, that the purpose concerning Daniel might not be changed."
Daniel,6,18,Now the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; and no musicians were brought before him. Also his sleep went from him.
Daniel,6,19,Then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste to the den of lions.
Daniel,6,20,"And when he came to the den, he cried out with a lamenting voice to Daniel. The king spoke, saying to Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?”"
Daniel,6,21,"Then Daniel said to the king, “O king, live forever!"
Daniel,6,22,"My God sent His angel and shut the lions’ mouths, so that they have not hurt me, because I was found innocent before Him; and also, O king, I have done no wrong before you.”"
Daniel,6,23,"Now the king was exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no injury whatever was found on him, because he believed in his God."
Daniel,6,24,"And the king gave the command, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions—them, their children, and their wives; and the lions overpowered them, and broke all their bones in pieces before they ever came to the bottom of the den."
Daniel,6,25,"Then King Darius wrote: To all peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you."
Daniel,6,26,"I make a decree that in every dominion of my kingdom men must tremble and fear before the God of Daniel. For He is the living God, And steadfast forever; His kingdom is the one which shall not be destroyed, And His dominion shall endure to the end."
Daniel,6,27,"He delivers and rescues, And He works signs and wonders In heaven and on earth, Who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions."
Daniel,6,28,So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
Daniel,7,1,"In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head while on his bed. Then he wrote down the dream, telling the main facts."
Daniel,7,2,"Daniel spoke, saying, “I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the Great Sea."
Daniel,7,3,"And four great beasts came up from the sea, each different from the other."
Daniel,7,4,"The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings. I watched till its wings were plucked off; and it was lifted up from the earth and made to stand on two feet like a man, and a man’s heart was given to it."
Daniel,7,5,"“And suddenly another beast, a second, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. And they said thus to it: ‘Arise, devour much flesh!’"
Daniel,7,6,"“After this I looked, and there was another, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird. The beast also had four heads, and dominion was given to it."
Daniel,7,7,"“After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, exceedingly strong. It had huge iron teeth; it was devouring, breaking in pieces, and trampling the residue with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns."
Daniel,7,8,"I was considering the horns, and there was another horn, a little one, coming up among them, before whom three of the first horns were plucked out by the roots. And there, in this horn, were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking pompous words."
Daniel,7,9,"“I watched till thrones were put in place, And the Ancient of Days was seated; His garment was white as snow, And the hair of His head was like pure wool. His throne was a fiery flame, Its wheels a burning fire;"
Daniel,7,10,"A fiery stream issued And came forth from before Him. A thousand thousands ministered to Him; Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him. The court was seated, And the books were opened."
Daniel,7,11,"“I watched then because of the sound of the pompous words which the horn was speaking; I watched till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed and given to the burning flame."
Daniel,7,12,"As for the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away, yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time."
Daniel,7,13,"“I was watching in the night visions, And behold, One like the Son of Man, Coming with the clouds of heaven! He came to the Ancient of Days, And they brought Him near before Him."
Daniel,7,14,"Then to Him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, That all peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, Which shall not pass away, And His kingdom the one Which shall not be destroyed."
Daniel,7,15,"“I, Daniel, was grieved in my spirit within my body, and the visions of my head troubled me."
Daniel,7,16,"I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of these things:"
Daniel,7,17,"‘Those great beasts, which are four, are four kings which arise out of the earth."
Daniel,7,18,"But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.’"
Daniel,7,19,"“Then I wished to know the truth about the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, exceedingly dreadful, with its teeth of iron and its nails of bronze, which devoured, broke in pieces, and trampled the residue with its feet;"
Daniel,7,20,"and the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, before which three fell, namely, that horn which had eyes and a mouth which spoke pompous words, whose appearance was greater than his fellows."
Daniel,7,21,"“I was watching; and the same horn was making war against the saints, and prevailing against them,"
Daniel,7,22,"until the Ancient of Days came, and a judgment was made in favor of the saints of the Most High, and the time came for the saints to possess the kingdom."
Daniel,7,23,"“Thus he said: ‘The fourth beast shall be A fourth kingdom on earth, Which shall be different from all other kingdoms, And shall devour the whole earth, Trample it and break it in pieces."
Daniel,7,24,"The ten horns are ten kings Who shall arise from this kingdom. And another shall rise after them; He shall be different from the first ones, And shall subdue three kings."
Daniel,7,25,"He shall speak pompous words against the Most High, Shall persecute the saints of the Most High, And shall intend to change times and law. Then the saints shall be given into his hand For a time and times and half a time."
Daniel,7,26,"‘But the court shall be seated, And they shall take away his dominion, To consume and destroy it forever."
Daniel,7,27,"Then the kingdom and dominion, And the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, Shall be given to the people, the saints of the Most High. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, And all dominions shall serve and obey Him.’"
Daniel,7,28,"“This is the end of the account. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts greatly troubled me, and my countenance changed; but I kept the matter in my heart.”"
Daniel,8,1,"In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision appeared to me—to me, Daniel—after the one that appeared to me the first time."
Daniel,8,2,"I saw in the vision, and it so happened while I was looking, that I was in Shushan, the citadel, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision that I was by the River Ulai."
Daniel,8,3,"Then I lifted my eyes and saw, and there, standing beside the river, was a ram which had two horns, and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last."
Daniel,8,4,"I saw the ram pushing westward, northward, and southward, so that no animal could withstand him; nor was there any that could deliver from his hand, but he did according to his will and became great."
Daniel,8,5,"And as I was considering, suddenly a male goat came from the west, across the surface of the whole earth, without touching the ground; and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes."
Daniel,8,6,"Then he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing beside the river, and ran at him with furious power."
Daniel,8,7,"And I saw him confronting the ram; he was moved with rage against him, attacked the ram, and broke his two horns. There was no power in the ram to withstand him, but he cast him down to the ground and trampled him; and there was no one that could deliver the ram from his hand."
Daniel,8,8,"Therefore the male goat grew very great; but when he became strong, the large horn was broken, and in place of it four notable ones came up toward the four winds of heaven."
Daniel,8,9,"And out of one of them came a little horn which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the Glorious Land."
Daniel,8,10,"And it grew up to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and some of the stars to the ground, and trampled them."
Daniel,8,11,"He even exalted himself as high as the Prince of the host; and by him the daily sacrifices were taken away, and the place of His sanctuary was cast down."
Daniel,8,12,"Because of transgression, an army was given over to the horn to oppose the daily sacrifices; and he cast truth down to the ground. He did all this and prospered."
Daniel,8,13,"Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to that certain one who was speaking, “How long will the vision be, concerning the daily sacrifices and the transgression of desolation, the giving of both the sanctuary and the host to be trampled underfoot?”"
Daniel,8,14,"And he said to me, “For two thousand three hundred days; then the sanctuary shall be cleansed.”"
Daniel,8,15,"Then it happened, when I, Daniel, had seen the vision and was seeking the meaning, that suddenly there stood before me one having the appearance of a man."
Daniel,8,16,"And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of the Ulai, who called, and said, “Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.”"
Daniel,8,17,"So he came near where I stood, and when he came I was afraid and fell on my face; but he said to me, “Understand, son of man, that the vision refers to the time of the end.”"
Daniel,8,18,"Now, as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep with my face to the ground; but he touched me, and stood me upright."
Daniel,8,19,"And he said, “Look, I am making known to you what shall happen in the latter time of the indignation; for at the appointed time the end shall be."
Daniel,8,20,"The ram which you saw, having the two horns—they are the kings of Media and Persia."
Daniel,8,21,And the male goat is the kingdom of Greece. The large horn that is between its eyes is the first king.
Daniel,8,22,"As for the broken horn and the four that stood up in its place, four kingdoms shall arise out of that nation, but not with its power."
Daniel,8,23,"“And in the latter time of their kingdom, When the transgressors have reached their fullness, A king shall arise, Having fierce features, Who understands sinister schemes."
Daniel,8,24,"His power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; He shall destroy fearfully, And shall prosper and thrive; He shall destroy the mighty, and also the holy people."
Daniel,8,25,“Through his cunning He shall cause deceit to prosper under his rule; And he shall exalt himself in his heart. He shall destroy many in their prosperity. He shall even rise against the Prince of princes; But he shall be broken without human means.
Daniel,8,26,"“And the vision of the evenings and mornings Which was told is true; Therefore seal up the vision, For it refers to many days in the future.”"
Daniel,8,27,"And I, Daniel, fainted and was sick for days; afterward I arose and went about the king’s business. I was astonished by the vision, but no one understood it."
Daniel,9,1,"In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the lineage of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans—"
Daniel,9,2,"in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, understood by the books the number of the years specified by the word of the LORD through Jeremiah the prophet, that He would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem."
Daniel,9,3,"Then I set my face toward the Lord God to make request by prayer and supplications, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes."
Daniel,9,4,"And I prayed to the LORD my God, and made confession, and said, “O Lord, great and awesome God, who keeps His covenant and mercy with those who love Him, and with those who keep His commandments,"
Daniel,9,5,"we have sinned and committed iniquity, we have done wickedly and rebelled, even by departing from Your precepts and Your judgments."
Daniel,9,6,"Neither have we heeded Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings and our princes, to our fathers and all the people of the land."
Daniel,9,7,"O Lord, righteousness belongs to You, but to us shame of face, as it is this day—to the men of Judah, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel, those near and those far off in all the countries to which You have driven them, because of the unfaithfulness which they have committed against You."
Daniel,9,8,"“O Lord, to us belongs shame of face, to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, because we have sinned against You."
Daniel,9,9,"To the Lord our God belong mercy and forgiveness, though we have rebelled against Him."
Daniel,9,10,"We have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in His laws, which He set before us by His servants the prophets."
Daniel,9,11,"Yes, all Israel has transgressed Your law, and has departed so as not to obey Your voice; therefore the curse and the oath written in the Law of Moses the servant of God have been poured out on us, because we have sinned against Him."
Daniel,9,12,"And He has confirmed His words, which He spoke against us and against our judges who judged us, by bringing upon us a great disaster; for under the whole heaven such has never been done as what has been done to Jerusalem."
Daniel,9,13,"“As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come upon us; yet we have not made our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities and understand Your truth."
Daniel,9,14,"Therefore the LORD has kept the disaster in mind, and brought it upon us; for the LORD our God is righteous in all the works which He does, though we have not obeyed His voice."
Daniel,9,15,"And now, O Lord our God, who brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and made Yourself a name, as it is this day—we have sinned, we have done wickedly!"
Daniel,9,16,"“O Lord, according to all Your righteousness, I pray, let Your anger and Your fury be turned away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people are a reproach to all those around us."
Daniel,9,17,"Now therefore, our God, hear the prayer of Your servant, and his supplications, and for the Lord’s sake cause Your face to shine on Your sanctuary, which is desolate."
Daniel,9,18,"O my God, incline Your ear and hear; open Your eyes and see our desolations, and the city which is called by Your name; for we do not present our supplications before You because of our righteous deeds, but because of Your great mercies."
Daniel,9,19,"O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, listen and act! Do not delay for Your own sake, my God, for Your city and Your people are called by Your name.”"
Daniel,9,20,"Now while I was speaking, praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God,"
Daniel,9,21,"yes, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, reached me about the time of the evening offering."
Daniel,9,22,"And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, “O Daniel, I have now come forth to give you skill to understand."
Daniel,9,23,"At the beginning of your supplications the command went out, and I have come to tell you, for you are greatly beloved; therefore consider the matter, and understand the vision:"
Daniel,9,24,"“Seventy weeks are determined For your people and for your holy city, To finish the transgression, To make an end of sins, To make reconciliation for iniquity, To bring in everlasting righteousness, To seal up vision and prophecy, And to anoint the Most Holy."
Daniel,9,25,"“Know therefore and understand, That from the going forth of the command To restore and build Jerusalem Until Messiah the Prince, There shall be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; The street shall be built again, and the wall, Even in troublesome times."
Daniel,9,26,"“And after the sixty-two weeks Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself; And the people of the prince who is to come Shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end of it shall be with a flood, And till the end of the war desolations are determined."
Daniel,9,27,"Then he shall confirm a covenant with many for one week; But in the middle of the week He shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominations shall be one who makes desolate, Even until the consummation, which is determined, Is poured out on the desolate.”"
Daniel,10,1,"In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a message was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar. The message was true, but the appointed time was long; and he understood the message, and had understanding of the vision."
Daniel,10,2,"In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three full weeks."
Daniel,10,3,"I ate no pleasant food, no meat or wine came into my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled."
Daniel,10,4,"Now on the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, that is, the Tigris,"
Daniel,10,5,"I lifted my eyes and looked, and behold, a certain man clothed in linen, whose waist was girded with gold of Uphaz!"
Daniel,10,6,"His body was like beryl, his face like the appearance of lightning, his eyes like torches of fire, his arms and feet like burnished bronze in color, and the sound of his words like the voice of a multitude."
Daniel,10,7,"And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision; but a great terror fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves."
Daniel,10,8,"Therefore I was left alone when I saw this great vision, and no strength remained in me; for my vigor was turned to frailty in me, and I retained no strength."
Daniel,10,9,"Yet I heard the sound of his words; and while I heard the sound of his words I was in a deep sleep on my face, with my face to the ground."
Daniel,10,10,"Suddenly, a hand touched me, which made me tremble on my knees and on the palms of my hands."
Daniel,10,11,"And he said to me, “O Daniel, man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright, for I have now been sent to you.” While he was speaking this word to me, I stood trembling."
Daniel,10,12,"Then he said to me, “Do not fear, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard; and I have come because of your words."
Daniel,10,13,"But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days; and behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I had been left alone there with the kings of Persia."
Daniel,10,14,"Now I have come to make you understand what will happen to your people in the latter days, for the vision refers to many days yet to come.”"
Daniel,10,15,"When he had spoken such words to me, I turned my face toward the ground and became speechless."
Daniel,10,16,"And suddenly, one having the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips; then I opened my mouth and spoke, saying to him who stood before me, “My lord, because of the vision my sorrows have overwhelmed me, and I have retained no strength."
Daniel,10,17,"For how can this servant of my lord talk with you, my lord? As for me, no strength remains in me now, nor is any breath left in me.”"
Daniel,10,18,"Then again, the one having the likeness of a man touched me and strengthened me."
Daniel,10,19,"And he said, “O man greatly beloved, fear not! Peace be to you; be strong, yes, be strong!” So when he spoke to me I was strengthened, and said, “Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.”"
Daniel,10,20,"Then he said, “Do you know why I have come to you? And now I must return to fight with the prince of Persia; and when I have gone forth, indeed the prince of Greece will come."
Daniel,10,21,"But I will tell you what is noted in the Scripture of Truth. (No one upholds me against these, except Michael your prince."
Daniel,11,1,"“Also in the first year of Darius the Mede, I, even I, stood up to confirm and strengthen him.)"
Daniel,11,2,"And now I will tell you the truth: Behold, three more kings will arise in Persia, and the fourth shall be far richer than them all; by his strength, through his riches, he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece."
Daniel,11,3,"Then a mighty king shall arise, who shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will."
Daniel,11,4,"And when he has arisen, his kingdom shall be broken up and divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not among his posterity nor according to his dominion with which he ruled; for his kingdom shall be uprooted, even for others besides these."
Daniel,11,5,"“Also the king of the South shall become strong, as well as one of his princes; and he shall gain power over him and have dominion. His dominion shall be a great dominion."
Daniel,11,6,"And at the end of some years they shall join forces, for the daughter of the king of the South shall go to the king of the North to make an agreement; but she shall not retain the power of her authority, and neither he nor his authority shall stand; but she shall be given up, with those who brought her, and with him who begot her, and with him who strengthened her in those times."
Daniel,11,7,"But from a branch of her roots one shall arise in his place, who shall come with an army, enter the fortress of the king of the North, and deal with them and prevail."
Daniel,11,8,"And he shall also carry their gods captive to Egypt, with their princes and their precious articles of silver and gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the North."
Daniel,11,9,"“Also the king of the North shall come to the kingdom of the king of the South, but shall return to his own land."
Daniel,11,10,"However his sons shall stir up strife, and assemble a multitude of great forces; and one shall certainly come and overwhelm and pass through; then he shall return to his fortress and stir up strife."
Daniel,11,11,"“And the king of the South shall be moved with rage, and go out and fight with him, with the king of the North, who shall muster a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into the hand of his enemy."
Daniel,11,12,"When he has taken away the multitude, his heart will be lifted up; and he will cast down tens of thousands, but he will not prevail."
Daniel,11,13,"For the king of the North will return and muster a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come at the end of some years with a great army and much equipment."
Daniel,11,14,"“Now in those times many shall rise up against the king of the South. Also, violent men of your people shall exalt themselves in fulfillment of the vision, but they shall fall."
Daniel,11,15,"So the king of the North shall come and build a siege mound, and take a fortified city; and the forces of the South shall not withstand him. Even his choice troops shall have no strength to resist."
Daniel,11,16,"But he who comes against him shall do according to his own will, and no one shall stand against him. He shall stand in the Glorious Land with destruction in his power."
Daniel,11,17,"“He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do. And he shall give him the daughter of women to destroy it; but she shall not stand with him, or be for him."
Daniel,11,18,"After this he shall turn his face to the coastlands, and shall take many. But a ruler shall bring the reproach against them to an end; and with the reproach removed, he shall turn back on him."
Daniel,11,19,"Then he shall turn his face toward the fortress of his own land; but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found."
Daniel,11,20,"“There shall arise in his place one who imposes taxes on the glorious kingdom; but within a few days he shall be destroyed, but not in anger or in battle."
Daniel,11,21,"And in his place shall arise a vile person, to whom they will not give the honor of royalty; but he shall come in peaceably, and seize the kingdom by intrigue."
Daniel,11,22,"With the force of a flood they shall be swept away from before him and be broken, and also the prince of the covenant."
Daniel,11,23,"And after the league is made with him he shall act deceitfully, for he shall come up and become strong with a small number of people."
Daniel,11,24,"He shall enter peaceably, even into the richest places of the province; and he shall do what his fathers have not done, nor his forefathers: he shall disperse among them the plunder, spoil, and riches; and he shall devise his plans against the strongholds, but only for a time."
Daniel,11,25,"“He shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the South with a great army. And the king of the South shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand, for they shall devise plans against him."
Daniel,11,26,"Yes, those who eat of the portion of his delicacies shall destroy him; his army shall be swept away, and many shall fall down slain."
Daniel,11,27,"Both these kings’ hearts shall be bent on evil, and they shall speak lies at the same table; but it shall not prosper, for the end will still be at the appointed time."
Daniel,11,28,"While returning to his land with great riches, his heart shall be moved against the holy covenant; so he shall do damage and return to his own land."
Daniel,11,29,“At the appointed time he shall return and go toward the south; but it shall not be like the former or the latter.
Daniel,11,30,"For ships from Cyprus shall come against him; therefore he shall be grieved, and return in rage against the holy covenant, and do damage. “So he shall return and show regard for those who forsake the holy covenant."
Daniel,11,31,"And forces shall be mustered by him, and they shall defile the sanctuary fortress; then they shall take away the daily sacrifices, and place there the abomination of desolation."
Daniel,11,32,"Those who do wickedly against the covenant he shall corrupt with flattery; but the people who know their God shall be strong, and carry out great exploits."
Daniel,11,33,"And those of the people who understand shall instruct many; yet for many days they shall fall by sword and flame, by captivity and plundering."
Daniel,11,34,"Now when they fall, they shall be aided with a little help; but many shall join with them by intrigue."
Daniel,11,35,"And some of those of understanding shall fall, to refine them, purify them, and make them white, until the time of the end; because it is still for the appointed time."
Daniel,11,36,"“Then the king shall do according to his own will: he shall exalt and magnify himself above every god, shall speak blasphemies against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the wrath has been accomplished; for what has been determined shall be done."
Daniel,11,37,"He shall regard neither the God of his fathers nor the desire of women, nor regard any god; for he shall exalt himself above them all."
Daniel,11,38,"But in their place he shall honor a god of fortresses; and a god which his fathers did not know he shall honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and pleasant things."
Daniel,11,39,"Thus he shall act against the strongest fortresses with a foreign god, which he shall acknowledge, and advance its glory; and he shall cause them to rule over many, and divide the land for gain."
Daniel,11,40,"“At the time of the end the king of the South shall attack him; and the king of the North shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter the countries, overwhelm them, and pass through."
Daniel,11,41,"He shall also enter the Glorious Land, and many countries shall be overthrown; but these shall escape from his hand: Edom, Moab, and the prominent people of Ammon."
Daniel,11,42,"He shall stretch out his hand against the countries, and the land of Egypt shall not escape."
Daniel,11,43,"He shall have power over the treasures of gold and silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; also the Libyans and Ethiopians shall follow at his heels."
Daniel,11,44,But news from the east and the north shall trouble him; therefore he shall go out with great fury to destroy and annihilate many.
Daniel,11,45,"And he shall plant the tents of his palace between the seas and the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and no one will help him."
Daniel,12,1,"“At that time Michael shall stand up, The great prince who stands watch over the sons of your people; And there shall be a time of trouble, Such as never was since there was a nation, Even to that time. And at that time your people shall be delivered, Every one who is found written in the book."
Daniel,12,2,"And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, Some to everlasting life, Some to shame and everlasting contempt."
Daniel,12,3,"Those who are wise shall shine Like the brightness of the firmament, And those who turn many to righteousness Like the stars forever and ever."
Daniel,12,4,"“But you, Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book until the time of the end; many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase.”"
Daniel,12,5,"Then I, Daniel, looked; and there stood two others, one on this riverbank and the other on that riverbank."
Daniel,12,6,"And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, “How long shall the fulfillment of these wonders be?”"
Daniel,12,7,"Then I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and swore by Him who lives forever, that it shall be for a time, times, and half a time; and when the power of the holy people has been completely shattered, all these things shall be finished."
Daniel,12,8,"Although I heard, I did not understand. Then I said, “My lord, what shall be the end of these things?”"
Daniel,12,9,"And he said, “Go your way, Daniel, for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end."
Daniel,12,10,"Many shall be purified, made white, and refined, but the wicked shall do wickedly; and none of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand."
Daniel,12,11,"“And from the time that the daily sacrifice is taken away, and the abomination of desolation is set up, there shall be one thousand two hundred and ninety days."
Daniel,12,12,"Blessed is he who waits, and comes to the one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days."
Daniel,12,13,"“But you, go your way till the end; for you shall rest, and will arise to your inheritance at the end of the days.”"
Hosea,1,1,"The word of the LORD that came to Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel."
Hosea,1,2,"When the LORD began to speak by Hosea, the LORD said to Hosea: “Go, take yourself a wife of harlotry And children of harlotry, For the land has committed great harlotry By departing from the LORD.”"
Hosea,1,3,"So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son."
Hosea,1,4,"Then the LORD said to him: “Call his name Jezreel, For in a little while I will avenge the bloodshed of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, And bring an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel."
Hosea,1,5,It shall come to pass in that day That I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel.”
Hosea,1,6,"And she conceived again and bore a daughter. Then God said to him: “Call her name Lo-Ruhamah, For I will no longer have mercy on the house of Israel, But I will utterly take them away."
Hosea,1,7,"Yet I will have mercy on the house of Judah, Will save them by the LORD their God, And will not save them by bow, Nor by sword or battle, By horses or horsemen.”"
Hosea,1,8,"Now when she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, she conceived and bore a son."
Hosea,1,9,"Then God said: “Call his name Lo-Ammi, For you are not My people, And I will not be your God."
Hosea,1,10,"“Yet the number of the children of Israel Shall be as the sand of the sea, Which cannot be measured or numbered. And it shall come to pass In the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not My people,’ There it shall be said to them, ‘You are sons of the living God.’"
Hosea,1,11,"Then the children of Judah and the children of Israel Shall be gathered together, And appoint for themselves one head; And they shall come up out of the land, For great will be the day of Jezreel!"
Hosea,2,1,"Say to your brethren, ‘My people,’ And to your sisters, ‘Mercy is shown.’"
Hosea,2,2,"“Bring charges against your mother, bring charges; For she is not My wife, nor am I her Husband! Let her put away her harlotries from her sight, And her adulteries from between her breasts;"
Hosea,2,3,"Lest I strip her naked And expose her, as in the day she was born, And make her like a wilderness, And set her like a dry land, And slay her with thirst."
Hosea,2,4,"“I will not have mercy on her children, For they are the children of harlotry."
Hosea,2,5,"For their mother has played the harlot; She who conceived them has behaved shamefully. For she said, ‘I will go after my lovers, Who give me my bread and my water, My wool and my linen, My oil and my drink.’"
Hosea,2,6,"“Therefore, behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns, And wall her in, So that she cannot find her paths."
Hosea,2,7,"She will chase her lovers, But not overtake them; Yes, she will seek them, but not find them. Then she will say, ‘I will go and return to my first husband, For then it was better for me than now.’"
Hosea,2,8,"For she did not know That I gave her grain, new wine, and oil, And multiplied her silver and gold— Which they prepared for Baal."
Hosea,2,9,"“Therefore I will return and take away My grain in its time And My new wine in its season, And will take back My wool and My linen, Given to cover her nakedness."
Hosea,2,10,"Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, And no one shall deliver her from My hand."
Hosea,2,11,"I will also cause all her mirth to cease, Her feast days, Her New Moons, Her Sabbaths— All her appointed feasts."
Hosea,2,12,"“And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, Of which she has said, ‘These are my wages that my lovers have given me.’ So I will make them a forest, And the beasts of the field shall eat them."
Hosea,2,13,"I will punish her For the days of the Baals to which she burned incense. She decked herself with her earrings and jewelry, And went after her lovers; But Me she forgot,” says the LORD."
Hosea,2,14,"“Therefore, behold, I will allure her, Will bring her into the wilderness, And speak comfort to her."
Hosea,2,15,"I will give her her vineyards from there, And the Valley of Achor as a door of hope; She shall sing there, As in the days of her youth, As in the day when she came up from the land of Egypt."
Hosea,2,16,"“And it shall be, in that day,” Says the LORD, “That you will call Me ‘My Husband,’ And no longer call Me ‘My Master,’"
Hosea,2,17,"For I will take from her mouth the names of the Baals, And they shall be remembered by their name no more."
Hosea,2,18,"In that day I will make a covenant for them With the beasts of the field, With the birds of the air, And with the creeping things of the ground. Bow and sword of battle I will shatter from the earth, To make them lie down safely."
Hosea,2,19,"“I will betroth you to Me forever; Yes, I will betroth you to Me In righteousness and justice, In lovingkindness and mercy;"
Hosea,2,20,"I will betroth you to Me in faithfulness, And you shall know the LORD."
Hosea,2,21,"“It shall come to pass in that day That I will answer,” says the LORD; “I will answer the heavens, And they shall answer the earth."
Hosea,2,22,"The earth shall answer With grain, With new wine, And with oil; They shall answer Jezreel."
Hosea,2,23,"Then I will sow her for Myself in the earth, And I will have mercy on her who had not obtained mercy; Then I will say to those who were not My people, ‘You are My people!’ And they shall say, ‘You are my God!’”"
Hosea,3,1,"Then the LORD said to me, “Go again, love a woman who is loved by a lover and is committing adultery, just like the love of the LORD for the children of Israel, who look to other gods and love the raisin cakes of the pagans.”"
Hosea,3,2,"So I bought her for myself for fifteen shekels of silver, and one and one-half homers of barley."
Hosea,3,3,"And I said to her, “You shall stay with me many days; you shall not play the harlot, nor shall you have a man—so, too, will I be toward you.”"
Hosea,3,4,"For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred pillar, without ephod or teraphim."
Hosea,3,5,Afterward the children of Israel shall return and seek the LORD their God and David their king. They shall fear the LORD and His goodness in the latter days.
Hosea,4,1,"Hear the word of the LORD, You children of Israel, For the LORD brings a charge against the inhabitants of the land: “There is no truth or mercy Or knowledge of God in the land."
Hosea,4,2,"By swearing and lying, Killing and stealing and committing adultery, They break all restraint, With bloodshed upon bloodshed."
Hosea,4,3,Therefore the land will mourn; And everyone who dwells there will waste away With the beasts of the field And the birds of the air; Even the fish of the sea will be taken away.
Hosea,4,4,"“Now let no man contend, or rebuke another; For your people are like those who contend with the priest."
Hosea,4,5,Therefore you shall stumble in the day; The prophet also shall stumble with you in the night; And I will destroy your mother.
Hosea,4,6,"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I also will reject you from being priest for Me; Because you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children."
Hosea,4,7,"“The more they increased, The more they sinned against Me; I will change their glory into shame."
Hosea,4,8,They eat up the sin of My people; They set their heart on their iniquity.
Hosea,4,9,"And it shall be: like people, like priest. So I will punish them for their ways, And reward them for their deeds."
Hosea,4,10,"For they shall eat, but not have enough; They shall commit harlotry, but not increase; Because they have ceased obeying the LORD."
Hosea,4,11,"“Harlotry, wine, and new wine enslave the heart."
Hosea,4,12,"My people ask counsel from their wooden idols, And their staff informs them. For the spirit of harlotry has caused them to stray, And they have played the harlot against their God."
Hosea,4,13,"They offer sacrifices on the mountaintops, And burn incense on the hills, Under oaks, poplars, and terebinths, Because their shade is good. Therefore your daughters commit harlotry, And your brides commit adultery."
Hosea,4,14,"“I will not punish your daughters when they commit harlotry, Nor your brides when they commit adultery; For the men themselves go apart with harlots, And offer sacrifices with a ritual harlot. Therefore people who do not understand will be trampled."
Hosea,4,15,"“Though you, Israel, play the harlot, Let not Judah offend. Do not come up to Gilgal, Nor go up to Beth Aven, Nor swear an oath, saying, ‘As the LORD lives’—"
Hosea,4,16,“For Israel is stubborn Like a stubborn calf; Now the LORD will let them forage Like a lamb in open country.
Hosea,4,17,"“Ephraim is joined to idols, Let him alone."
Hosea,4,18,"Their drink is rebellion, They commit harlotry continually. Her rulers dearly love dishonor."
Hosea,4,19,"The wind has wrapped her up in its wings, And they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices."
Hosea,5,1,"“Hear this, O priests! Take heed, O house of Israel! Give ear, O house of the king! For yours is the judgment, Because you have been a snare to Mizpah And a net spread on Tabor."
Hosea,5,2,"The revolters are deeply involved in slaughter, Though I rebuke them all."
Hosea,5,3,"I know Ephraim, And Israel is not hidden from Me; For now, O Ephraim, you commit harlotry; Israel is defiled."
Hosea,5,4,"“They do not direct their deeds Toward turning to their God, For the spirit of harlotry is in their midst, And they do not know the LORD."
Hosea,5,5,The pride of Israel testifies to his face; Therefore Israel and Ephraim stumble in their iniquity; Judah also stumbles with them.
Hosea,5,6,"“With their flocks and herds They shall go to seek the LORD, But they will not find Him; He has withdrawn Himself from them."
Hosea,5,7,"They have dealt treacherously with the LORD, For they have begotten pagan children. Now a New Moon shall devour them and their heritage."
Hosea,5,8,"“Blow the ram’s horn in Gibeah, The trumpet in Ramah! Cry aloud at Beth Aven, ‘Look behind you, O Benjamin!’"
Hosea,5,9,Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke; Among the tribes of Israel I make known what is sure.
Hosea,5,10,“The princes of Judah are like those who remove a landmark; I will pour out My wrath on them like water.
Hosea,5,11,"Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, Because he willingly walked by human precept."
Hosea,5,12,"Therefore I will be to Ephraim like a moth, And to the house of Judah like rottenness."
Hosea,5,13,"“When Ephraim saw his sickness, And Judah saw his wound, Then Ephraim went to Assyria And sent to King Jareb; Yet he cannot cure you, Nor heal you of your wound."
Hosea,5,14,"For I will be like a lion to Ephraim, And like a young lion to the house of Judah. I, even I, will tear them and go away; I will take them away, and no one shall rescue."
Hosea,5,15,I will return again to My place Till they acknowledge their offense. Then they will seek My face; In their affliction they will earnestly seek Me.”
Hosea,6,1,"Come, and let us return to the LORD; For He has torn, but He will heal us; He has stricken, but He will bind us up."
Hosea,6,2,"After two days He will revive us; On the third day He will raise us up, That we may live in His sight."
Hosea,6,3,"Let us know, Let us pursue the knowledge of the LORD. His going forth is established as the morning; He will come to us like the rain, Like the latter and former rain to the earth."
Hosea,6,4,"“O Ephraim, what shall I do to you? O Judah, what shall I do to you? For your faithfulness is like a morning cloud, And like the early dew it goes away."
Hosea,6,5,"Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets, I have slain them by the words of My mouth; And your judgments are like light that goes forth."
Hosea,6,6,"For I desire mercy and not sacrifice, And the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings."
Hosea,6,7,“But like men they transgressed the covenant; There they dealt treacherously with Me.
Hosea,6,8,Gilead is a city of evildoers And defiled with blood.
Hosea,6,9,"As bands of robbers lie in wait for a man, So the company of priests murder on the way to Shechem; Surely they commit lewdness."
Hosea,6,10,I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel: There is the harlotry of Ephraim; Israel is defiled.
Hosea,6,11,"Also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed for you, When I return the captives of My people."
Hosea,7,1,"“When I would have healed Israel, Then the iniquity of Ephraim was uncovered, And the wickedness of Samaria. For they have committed fraud; A thief comes in; A band of robbers takes spoil outside."
Hosea,7,2,They do not consider in their hearts That I remember all their wickedness; Now their own deeds have surrounded them; They are before My face.
Hosea,7,3,"They make a king glad with their wickedness, And princes with their lies."
Hosea,7,4,"“They are all adulterers. Like an oven heated by a baker— He ceases stirring the fire after kneading the dough, Until it is leavened."
Hosea,7,5,"In the day of our king Princes have made him sick, inflamed with wine; He stretched out his hand with scoffers."
Hosea,7,6,"They prepare their heart like an oven, While they lie in wait; Their baker sleeps all night; In the morning it burns like a flaming fire."
Hosea,7,7,"They are all hot, like an oven, And have devoured their judges; All their kings have fallen. None among them calls upon Me."
Hosea,7,8,“Ephraim has mixed himself among the peoples; Ephraim is a cake unturned.
Hosea,7,9,"Aliens have devoured his strength, But he does not know it; Yes, gray hairs are here and there on him, Yet he does not know it."
Hosea,7,10,"And the pride of Israel testifies to his face, But they do not return to the LORD their God, Nor seek Him for all this."
Hosea,7,11,"“Ephraim also is like a silly dove, without sense— They call to Egypt, They go to Assyria."
Hosea,7,12,"Wherever they go, I will spread My net on them; I will bring them down like birds of the air; I will chastise them According to what their congregation has heard."
Hosea,7,13,"“Woe to them, for they have fled from Me! Destruction to them, Because they have transgressed against Me! Though I redeemed them, Yet they have spoken lies against Me."
Hosea,7,14,"They did not cry out to Me with their heart When they wailed upon their beds. “They assemble together for grain and new wine, They rebel against Me;"
Hosea,7,15,"Though I disciplined and strengthened their arms, Yet they devise evil against Me;"
Hosea,7,16,"They return, but not to the Most High; They are like a treacherous bow. Their princes shall fall by the sword For the cursings of their tongue. This shall be their derision in the land of Egypt."
Hosea,8,1,"“Set the trumpet to your mouth! He shall come like an eagle against the house of the LORD, Because they have transgressed My covenant And rebelled against My law."
Hosea,8,2,"Israel will cry to Me, ‘My God, we know You!’"
Hosea,8,3,Israel has rejected the good; The enemy will pursue him.
Hosea,8,4,"“They set up kings, but not by Me; They made princes, but I did not acknowledge them. From their silver and gold They made idols for themselves— That they might be cut off."
Hosea,8,5,"Your calf is rejected, O Samaria! My anger is aroused against them— How long until they attain to innocence?"
Hosea,8,6,"For from Israel is even this: A workman made it, and it is not God; But the calf of Samaria shall be broken to pieces."
Hosea,8,7,"“They sow the wind, And reap the whirlwind. The stalk has no bud; It shall never produce meal. If it should produce, Aliens would swallow it up."
Hosea,8,8,Israel is swallowed up; Now they are among the Gentiles Like a vessel in which is no pleasure.
Hosea,8,9,"For they have gone up to Assyria, Like a wild donkey alone by itself; Ephraim has hired lovers."
Hosea,8,10,"Yes, though they have hired among the nations, Now I will gather them; And they shall sorrow a little, Because of the burden of the king of princes."
Hosea,8,11,"“Because Ephraim has made many altars for sin, They have become for him altars for sinning."
Hosea,8,12,"I have written for him the great things of My law, But they were considered a strange thing."
Hosea,8,13,"For the sacrifices of My offerings they sacrifice flesh and eat it, But the LORD does not accept them. Now He will remember their iniquity and punish their sins. They shall return to Egypt."
Hosea,8,14,"“For Israel has forgotten his Maker, And has built temples; Judah also has multiplied fortified cities; But I will send fire upon his cities, And it shall devour his palaces.”"
Hosea,9,1,"Do not rejoice, O Israel, with joy like other peoples, For you have played the harlot against your God. You have made love for hire on every threshing floor."
Hosea,9,2,"The threshing floor and the winepress Shall not feed them, And the new wine shall fail in her."
Hosea,9,3,"They shall not dwell in the LORD’s land, But Ephraim shall return to Egypt, And shall eat unclean things in Assyria."
Hosea,9,4,"They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD, Nor shall their sacrifices be pleasing to Him. It shall be like bread of mourners to them; All who eat it shall be defiled. For their bread shall be for their own life; It shall not come into the house of the LORD."
Hosea,9,5,"What will you do in the appointed day, And in the day of the feast of the LORD?"
Hosea,9,6,For indeed they are gone because of destruction. Egypt shall gather them up; Memphis shall bury them. Nettles shall possess their valuables of silver; Thorns shall be in their tents.
Hosea,9,7,"The days of punishment have come; The days of recompense have come. Israel knows! The prophet is a fool, The spiritual man is insane, Because of the greatness of your iniquity and great enmity."
Hosea,9,8,The watchman of Ephraim is with my God; But the prophet is a fowler’s snare in all his ways— Enmity in the house of his God.
Hosea,9,9,"They are deeply corrupted, As in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their iniquity; He will punish their sins."
Hosea,9,10,"“I found Israel Like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers As the firstfruits on the fig tree in its first season. But they went to Baal Peor, And separated themselves to that shame; They became an abomination like the thing they loved."
Hosea,9,11,"As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird— No birth, no pregnancy, and no conception!"
Hosea,9,12,"Though they bring up their children, Yet I will bereave them to the last man. Yes, woe to them when I depart from them!"
Hosea,9,13,"Just as I saw Ephraim like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place, So Ephraim will bring out his children to the murderer.”"
Hosea,9,14,"Give them, O LORD— What will You give? Give them a miscarrying womb And dry breasts!"
Hosea,9,15,"“All their wickedness is in Gilgal, For there I hated them. Because of the evil of their deeds I will drive them from My house; I will love them no more. All their princes are rebellious."
Hosea,9,16,"Ephraim is stricken, Their root is dried up; They shall bear no fruit. Yes, were they to bear children, I would kill the darlings of their womb.”"
Hosea,9,17,"My God will cast them away, Because they did not obey Him; And they shall be wanderers among the nations."
Hosea,10,1,Israel empties his vine; He brings forth fruit for himself. According to the multitude of his fruit He has increased the altars; According to the bounty of his land They have embellished his sacred pillars.
Hosea,10,2,Their heart is divided; Now they are held guilty. He will break down their altars; He will ruin their sacred pillars.
Hosea,10,3,"For now they say, “We have no king, Because we did not fear the LORD. And as for a king, what would he do for us?”"
Hosea,10,4,"They have spoken words, Swearing falsely in making a covenant. Thus judgment springs up like hemlock in the furrows of the field."
Hosea,10,5,"The inhabitants of Samaria fear Because of the calf of Beth Aven. For its people mourn for it, And its priests shriek for it— Because its glory has departed from it."
Hosea,10,6,"The idol also shall be carried to Assyria As a present for King Jareb. Ephraim shall receive shame, And Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel."
Hosea,10,7,"As for Samaria, her king is cut off Like a twig on the water."
Hosea,10,8,"Also the high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, Shall be destroyed. The thorn and thistle shall grow on their altars; They shall say to the mountains, “Cover us!” And to the hills, “Fall on us!”"
Hosea,10,9,"“O Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah; There they stood. The battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity Did not overtake them."
Hosea,10,10,"When it is My desire, I will chasten them. Peoples shall be gathered against them When I bind them for their two transgressions."
Hosea,10,11,"Ephraim is a trained heifer That loves to thresh grain; But I harnessed her fair neck, I will make Ephraim pull a plow. Judah shall plow; Jacob shall break his clods.”"
Hosea,10,12,"Sow for yourselves righteousness; Reap in mercy; Break up your fallow ground, For it is time to seek the LORD, Till He comes and rains righteousness on you."
Hosea,10,13,"You have plowed wickedness; You have reaped iniquity. You have eaten the fruit of lies, Because you trusted in your own way, In the multitude of your mighty men."
Hosea,10,14,"Therefore tumult shall arise among your people, And all your fortresses shall be plundered As Shalman plundered Beth Arbel in the day of battle— A mother dashed in pieces upon her children."
Hosea,10,15,"Thus it shall be done to you, O Bethel, Because of your great wickedness. At dawn the king of Israel Shall be cut off utterly."
Hosea,11,1,"“When Israel was a child, I loved him, And out of Egypt I called My son."
Hosea,11,2,"As they called them, So they went from them; They sacrificed to the Baals, And burned incense to carved images."
Hosea,11,3,"“I taught Ephraim to walk, Taking them by their arms; But they did not know that I healed them."
Hosea,11,4,"I drew them with gentle cords, With bands of love, And I was to them as those who take the yoke from their neck. I stooped and fed them."
Hosea,11,5,"“He shall not return to the land of Egypt; But the Assyrian shall be his king, Because they refused to repent."
Hosea,11,6,"And the sword shall slash in his cities, Devour his districts, And consume them, Because of their own counsels."
Hosea,11,7,"My people are bent on backsliding from Me. Though they call to the Most High, None at all exalt Him."
Hosea,11,8,"“How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I set you like Zeboiim? My heart churns within Me; My sympathy is stirred."
Hosea,11,9,"I will not execute the fierceness of My anger; I will not again destroy Ephraim. For I am God, and not man, The Holy One in your midst; And I will not come with terror."
Hosea,11,10,"“They shall walk after the LORD. He will roar like a lion. When He roars, Then His sons shall come trembling from the west;"
Hosea,11,11,"They shall come trembling like a bird from Egypt, Like a dove from the land of Assyria. And I will let them dwell in their houses,” Says the LORD."
Hosea,11,12,"“Ephraim has encircled Me with lies, And the house of Israel with deceit; But Judah still walks with God, Even with the Holy One who is faithful."
Hosea,12,1,"“Ephraim feeds on the wind, And pursues the east wind; He daily increases lies and desolation. Also they make a covenant with the Assyrians, And oil is carried to Egypt."
Hosea,12,2,"“The LORD also brings a charge against Judah, And will punish Jacob according to his ways; According to his deeds He will recompense him."
Hosea,12,3,"He took his brother by the heel in the womb, And in his strength he struggled with God."
Hosea,12,4,"Yes, he struggled with the Angel and prevailed; He wept, and sought favor from Him. He found Him in Bethel, And there He spoke to us—"
Hosea,12,5,"That is, the LORD God of hosts. The LORD is His memorable name."
Hosea,12,6,"So you, by the help of your God, return; Observe mercy and justice, And wait on your God continually."
Hosea,12,7,“A cunning Canaanite! Deceitful scales are in his hand; He loves to oppress.
Hosea,12,8,"And Ephraim said, ‘Surely I have become rich, I have found wealth for myself; In all my labors They shall find in me no iniquity that is sin.’"
Hosea,12,9,"“But I am the LORD your God, Ever since the land of Egypt; I will again make you dwell in tents, As in the days of the appointed feast."
Hosea,12,10,"I have also spoken by the prophets, And have multiplied visions; I have given symbols through the witness of the prophets.”"
Hosea,12,11,"Though Gilead has idols— Surely they are vanity— Though they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal, Indeed their altars shall be heaps in the furrows of the field."
Hosea,12,12,"Jacob fled to the country of Syria; Israel served for a spouse, And for a wife he tended sheep."
Hosea,12,13,"By a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, And by a prophet he was preserved."

Hosea,13,2,"Now they sin more and more, And have made for themselves molded images, Idols of their silver, according to their skill; All of it is the work of craftsmen. They say of them, “Let the men who sacrifice kiss the calves!”"
Hosea,13,3,"Therefore they shall be like the morning cloud And like the early dew that passes away, Like chaff blown off from a threshing floor And like smoke from a chimney."

Hosea,13,6,"When they had pasture, they were filled; They were filled and their heart was exalted; Therefore they forgot Me."
Hosea,13,7,“So I will be to them like a lion; Like a leopard by the road I will lurk;

Joel,1,1,The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.
Joel,1,2,"Hear this, you elders, And give ear, all you inhabitants of the land! Has anything like this happened in your days, Or even in the days of your fathers?"
Joel,1,3,"Tell your children about it, Let your children tell their children, And their children another generation."
Joel,1,4,"What the chewing locust left, the swarming locust has eaten; What the swarming locust left, the crawling locust has eaten; And what the crawling locust left, the consuming locust has eaten."
Joel,1,5,"Awake, you drunkards, and weep; And wail, all you drinkers of wine, Because of the new wine, For it has been cut off from your mouth."
Joel,1,6,"For a nation has come up against My land, Strong, and without number; His teeth are the teeth of a lion, And he has the fangs of a fierce lion."
Joel,1,7,"He has laid waste My vine, And ruined My fig tree; He has stripped it bare and thrown it away; Its branches are made white."
Joel,1,8,Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth For the husband of her youth.
Joel,1,9,"The grain offering and the drink offering Have been cut off from the house of the LORD; The priests mourn, who minister to the LORD."
Joel,1,10,"The field is wasted, The land mourns; For the grain is ruined, The new wine is dried up, The oil fails."
Joel,1,11,"Be ashamed, you farmers, Wail, you vinedressers, For the wheat and the barley; Because the harvest of the field has perished."
Joel,1,12,"The vine has dried up, And the fig tree has withered; The pomegranate tree, The palm tree also, And the apple tree— All the trees of the field are withered; Surely joy has withered away from the sons of men."
Joel,1,13,"Gird yourselves and lament, you priests; Wail, you who minister before the altar; Come, lie all night in sackcloth, You who minister to my God; For the grain offering and the drink offering Are withheld from the house of your God."
Joel,1,14,"Consecrate a fast, Call a sacred assembly; Gather the elders And all the inhabitants of the land Into the house of the LORD your God, And cry out to the LORD."
Joel,1,15,Alas for the day! For the day of the LORD is at hand; It shall come as destruction from the Almighty.
Joel,1,16,"Is not the food cut off before our eyes, Joy and gladness from the house of our God?"
Joel,1,17,"The seed shrivels under the clods, Storehouses are in shambles; Barns are broken down, For the grain has withered."
Joel,1,18,"How the animals groan! The herds of cattle are restless, Because they have no pasture; Even the flocks of sheep suffer punishment."
Joel,1,19,"O LORD, to You I cry out; For fire has devoured the open pastures, And a flame has burned all the trees of the field."
Joel,1,20,"The beasts of the field also cry out to You, For the water brooks are dried up, And fire has devoured the open pastures."
Joel,2,1,"Blow the trumpet in Zion, And sound an alarm in My holy mountain! Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble; For the day of the LORD is coming, For it is at hand:"
Joel,2,2,"A day of darkness and gloominess, A day of clouds and thick darkness, Like the morning clouds spread over the mountains. A people come, great and strong, The like of whom has never been; Nor will there ever be any such after them, Even for many successive generations."
Joel,2,3,"A fire devours before them, And behind them a flame burns; The land is like the Garden of Eden before them, And behind them a desolate wilderness; Surely nothing shall escape them."
Joel,2,4,"Their appearance is like the appearance of horses; And like swift steeds, so they run."
Joel,2,5,"With a noise like chariots Over mountaintops they leap, Like the noise of a flaming fire that devours the stubble, Like a strong people set in battle array."
Joel,2,6,Before them the people writhe in pain; All faces are drained of color.
Joel,2,7,"They run like mighty men, They climb the wall like men of war; Every one marches in formation, And they do not break ranks."
Joel,2,8,"They do not push one another; Every one marches in his own column. Though they lunge between the weapons, They are not cut down."
Joel,2,9,"They run to and fro in the city, They run on the wall; They climb into the houses, They enter at the windows like a thief."
Joel,2,10,"The earth quakes before them, The heavens tremble; The sun and moon grow dark, And the stars diminish their brightness."
Joel,2,11,"The LORD gives voice before His army, For His camp is very great; For strong is the One who executes His word. For the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; Who can endure it?"
Joel,2,12,"“Now, therefore,” says the LORD, “Turn to Me with all your heart, With fasting, with weeping, and with mourning.”"
Joel,2,13,"So rend your heart, and not your garments; Return to the LORD your God, For He is gracious and merciful, Slow to anger, and of great kindness; And He relents from doing harm."
Joel,2,14,"Who knows if He will turn and relent, And leave a blessing behind Him— A grain offering and a drink offering For the LORD your God?"
Joel,2,15,"Blow the trumpet in Zion, Consecrate a fast, Call a sacred assembly;"
Joel,2,16,"Gather the people, Sanctify the congregation, Assemble the elders, Gather the children and nursing babes; Let the bridegroom go out from his chamber, And the bride from her dressing room."
Joel,2,17,"Let the priests, who minister to the LORD, Weep between the porch and the altar; Let them say, “Spare Your people, O LORD, And do not give Your heritage to reproach, That the nations should rule over them. Why should they say among the peoples, ‘Where is their God?’”"
Joel,2,18,"Then the LORD will be zealous for His land, And pity His people."
Joel,2,19,"The LORD will answer and say to His people, “Behold, I will send you grain and new wine and oil, And you will be satisfied by them; I will no longer make you a reproach among the nations."
Joel,2,20,"“But I will remove far from you the northern army, And will drive him away into a barren and desolate land, With his face toward the eastern sea And his back toward the western sea; His stench will come up, And his foul odor will rise, Because he has done monstrous things.”"
Joel,2,21,"Fear not, O land; Be glad and rejoice, For the LORD has done marvelous things!"
Joel,2,22,"Do not be afraid, you beasts of the field; For the open pastures are springing up, And the tree bears its fruit; The fig tree and the vine yield their strength."
Joel,2,23,"Be glad then, you children of Zion, And rejoice in the LORD your God; For He has given you the former rain faithfully, And He will cause the rain to come down for you— The former rain, And the latter rain in the first month."
Joel,2,24,"The threshing floors shall be full of wheat, And the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil."
Joel,2,25,"“So I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, The crawling locust, The consuming locust, And the chewing locust, My great army which I sent among you."
Joel,2,26,"You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, And praise the name of the LORD your God, Who has dealt wondrously with you; And My people shall never be put to shame."
Joel,2,27,Then you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel: I am the LORD your God And there is no other. My people shall never be put to shame.
Joel,2,28,"“And it shall come to pass afterward That I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh; Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, Your old men shall dream dreams, Your young men shall see visions."
Joel,2,29,And also on My menservants and on My maidservants I will pour out My Spirit in those days.
Joel,2,30,“And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth: Blood and fire and pillars of smoke.
Joel,2,31,"The sun shall be turned into darkness, And the moon into blood, Before the coming of the great and awesome day of the LORD."
Joel,2,32,"And it shall come to pass That whoever calls on the name of the LORD Shall be saved. For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be deliverance, As the LORD has said, Among the remnant whom the LORD calls."
Joel,3,1,"“For behold, in those days and at that time, When I bring back the captives of Judah and Jerusalem,"
Joel,3,2,"I will also gather all nations, And bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat; And I will enter into judgment with them there On account of My people, My heritage Israel, Whom they have scattered among the nations; They have also divided up My land."
Joel,3,3,"They have cast lots for My people, Have given a boy as payment for a harlot, And sold a girl for wine, that they may drink."
Joel,3,4,"“Indeed, what have you to do with Me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all the coasts of Philistia? Will you retaliate against Me? But if you retaliate against Me, Swiftly and speedily I will return your retaliation upon your own head;"
Joel,3,5,"Because you have taken My silver and My gold, And have carried into your temples My prized possessions."
Joel,3,6,"Also the people of Judah and the people of Jerusalem You have sold to the Greeks, That you may remove them far from their borders."
Joel,3,7,"“Behold, I will raise them Out of the place to which you have sold them, And will return your retaliation upon your own head."
Joel,3,8,"I will sell your sons and your daughters Into the hand of the people of Judah, And they will sell them to the Sabeans, To a people far off; For the LORD has spoken.”"
Joel,3,9,"Proclaim this among the nations: “Prepare for war! Wake up the mighty men, Let all the men of war draw near, Let them come up."
Joel,3,10,"Beat your plowshares into swords And your pruning hooks into spears; Let the weak say, ‘I am strong.’”"
Joel,3,11,"Assemble and come, all you nations, And gather together all around. Cause Your mighty ones to go down there, O LORD."
Joel,3,12,"“Let the nations be wakened, and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat; For there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations."
Joel,3,13,"Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, go down; For the winepress is full, The vats overflow— For their wickedness is great.”"
Joel,3,14,"Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision."
Joel,3,15,"The sun and moon will grow dark, And the stars will diminish their brightness."
Joel,3,16,"The LORD also will roar from Zion, And utter His voice from Jerusalem; The heavens and earth will shake; But the LORD will be a shelter for His people, And the strength of the children of Israel."
Joel,3,17,"“So you shall know that I am the LORD your God, Dwelling in Zion My holy mountain. Then Jerusalem shall be holy, And no aliens shall ever pass through her again.”"
Joel,3,18,"And it will come to pass in that day That the mountains shall drip with new wine, The hills shall flow with milk, And all the brooks of Judah shall be flooded with water; A fountain shall flow from the house of the LORD And water the Valley of Acacias."
Joel,3,19,"“Egypt shall be a desolation, And Edom a desolate wilderness, Because of violence against the people of Judah, For they have shed innocent blood in their land."
Joel,3,20,"But Judah shall abide forever, And Jerusalem from generation to generation."
Joel,3,21,"For I will acquit them of the guilt of bloodshed, whom I had not acquitted; For the LORD dwells in Zion.”"

Amos,3,9,"“Proclaim in the palaces at Ashdod, And in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say: ‘Assemble on the mountains of Samaria; See great tumults in her midst, And the oppressed within her."
Amos,3,10,"For they do not know to do right,’ Says the LORD, ‘Who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.’”"

Amos,5,12,For I know your manifold transgressions And your mighty sins: Afflicting the just and taking bribes; Diverting the poor from justice at the gate.
Amos,5,13,"Therefore the prudent keep silent at that time, For it is an evil time."
Amos,5,14,"Seek good and not evil, That you may live; So the LORD God of hosts will be with you, As you have spoken."
Amos,5,15,"Hate evil, love good; Establish justice in the gate. It may be that the LORD God of hosts Will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph."

For we dare not mention the name of the LORD.”"
Amos,6,11,"For behold, the LORD gives a command: He will break the great house into bits, And the little house into pieces."

Amos,7,1,"Thus the Lord GOD showed me: Behold, He formed locust swarms at the beginning of the late crop; indeed it was the late crop after the king’s mowings."
Amos,7,2,"And so it was, when they had finished eating the grass of the land, that I said: “O Lord GOD, forgive, I pray! Oh, that Jacob may stand, For he is small!”"
Amos,7,3,"So the LORD relented concerning this. “It shall not be,” said the LORD."
Amos,7,4,"Thus the Lord GOD showed me: Behold, the Lord GOD called for conflict by fire, and it consumed the great deep and devoured the territory."
Amos,7,5,"Then I said: “O Lord GOD, cease, I pray! Oh, that Jacob may stand, For he is small!”"
Amos,7,6,"So the LORD relented concerning this. “This also shall not be,” said the Lord GOD."
Amos,7,7,"Thus He showed me: Behold, the Lord stood on a wall made with a plumb line, with a plumb line in His hand."

Amos,7,9,"The high places of Isaac shall be desolate, And the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste. I will rise with the sword against the house of Jeroboam.”"
Amos,7,10,"Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, “Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land is not able to bear all his words."
Amos,7,11,"For thus Amos has said: ‘Jeroboam shall die by the sword, And Israel shall surely be led away captive From their own land.’”"
Amos,7,12,"Then Amaziah said to Amos: “Go, you seer! Flee to the land of Judah. There eat bread, And there prophesy."
Amos,7,13,"But never again prophesy at Bethel, For it is the king’s sanctuary, And it is the royal residence.”"
Amos,7,14,"Then Amos answered, and said to Amaziah: “I was no prophet, Nor was I a son of a prophet, But I was a sheepbreeder And a tender of sycamore fruit."
Amos,7,15,"Then the LORD took me as I followed the flock, And the LORD said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to My people Israel.’"
Amos,7,16,"Now therefore, hear the word of the LORD: You say, ‘Do not prophesy against Israel, And do not spout against the house of Isaac.’"
Amos,7,17,“Therefore thus says the LORD: ‘Your wife shall be a harlot in the city; Your sons and daughters shall fall by the sword; Your land shall be divided by survey line; You shall die in a defiled land; And Israel shall surely be led away captive From his own land.’”
Amos,8,1,"Thus the Lord GOD showed me: Behold, a basket of summer fruit."

Amos,8,3,"And the songs of the temple Shall be wailing in that day,” Says the Lord GOD— “Many dead bodies everywhere, They shall be thrown out in silence.”"
Amos,8,4,"Hear this, you who swallow up the needy, And make the poor of the land fail,"
Amos,8,5,"Saying: “When will the New Moon be past, That we may sell grain? And the Sabbath, That we may trade wheat? Making the ephah small and the shekel large, Falsifying the scales by deceit,"
Amos,8,6,"That we may buy the poor for silver, And the needy for a pair of sandals— Even sell the bad wheat?”"
Amos,8,7,The LORD has sworn by the pride of Jacob: “Surely I will never forget any of their works.
Amos,8,8,"Shall the land not tremble for this, And everyone mourn who dwells in it? All of it shall swell like the River, Heave and subside Like the River of Egypt."
Amos,8,9,"“And it shall come to pass in that day,” says the Lord GOD, “That I will make the sun go down at noon, And I will darken the earth in broad daylight;"
Amos,8,10,"I will turn your feasts into mourning, And all your songs into lamentation; I will bring sackcloth on every waist, And baldness on every head; I will make it like mourning for an only son, And its end like a bitter day."
Amos,8,11,"“Behold, the days are coming,” says the Lord GOD, “That I will send a famine on the land, Not a famine of bread, Nor a thirst for water, But of hearing the words of the LORD."
Amos,8,12,"They shall wander from sea to sea, And from north to east; They shall run to and fro, seeking the word of the LORD, But shall not find it."
Amos,8,13,“In that day the fair virgins And strong young men Shall faint from thirst.
Amos,8,14,"Those who swear by the sin of Samaria, Who say, ‘As your god lives, O Dan!’ And, ‘As the way of Beersheba lives!’ They shall fall and never rise again.”"
Amos,9,1,"I saw the Lord standing by the altar, and He said: “Strike the doorposts, that the thresholds may shake, And break them on the heads of them all. I will slay the last of them with the sword. He who flees from them shall not get away, And he who escapes from them shall not be delivered."
Amos,9,2,"“Though they dig into hell, From there My hand shall take them; Though they climb up to heaven, From there I will bring them down;"
Amos,9,3,"And though they hide themselves on top of Carmel, From there I will search and take them; Though they hide from My sight at the bottom of the sea, From there I will command the serpent, and it shall bite them;"
Amos,9,4,"Though they go into captivity before their enemies, From there I will command the sword, And it shall slay them. I will set My eyes on them for harm and not for good.”"
Amos,9,5,"The Lord GOD of hosts, He who touches the earth and it melts, And all who dwell there mourn; All of it shall swell like the River, And subside like the River of Egypt."
Amos,9,6,"He who builds His layers in the sky, And has founded His strata in the earth; Who calls for the waters of the sea, And pours them out on the face of the earth— The LORD is His name."
Amos,9,7,"“Are you not like the people of Ethiopia to Me, O children of Israel?” says the LORD. “Did I not bring up Israel from the land of Egypt, The Philistines from Caphtor, And the Syrians from Kir?"
Amos,9,8,"“Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are on the sinful kingdom, And I will destroy it from the face of the earth; Yet I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,” Says the LORD."
Amos,9,9,"“For surely I will command, And will sift the house of Israel among all nations, As grain is sifted in a sieve; Yet not the smallest grain shall fall to the ground."
Amos,9,10,"All the sinners of My people shall die by the sword, Who say, ‘The calamity shall not overtake nor confront us.’"
Amos,9,11,"“On that day I will raise up The tabernacle of David, which has fallen down, And repair its damages; I will raise up its ruins, And rebuild it as in the days of old;"
Amos,9,12,"That they may possess the remnant of Edom, And all the Gentiles who are called by My name,” Says the LORD who does this thing."
Amos,9,13,"“Behold, the days are coming,” says the LORD, “When the plowman shall overtake the reaper, And the treader of grapes him who sows seed; The mountains shall drip with sweet wine, And all the hills shall flow with it."
Amos,9,14,I will bring back the captives of My people Israel; They shall build the waste cities and inhabit them; They shall plant vineyards and drink wine from them; They shall also make gardens and eat fruit from them.
Amos,9,15,"I will plant them in their land, And no longer shall they be pulled up From the land I have given them,” Says the LORD your God."
Obadiah,1,1,"The vision of Obadiah. Thus says the Lord GOD concerning Edom (We have heard a report from the LORD, And a messenger has been sent among the nations, saying, “Arise, and let us rise up against her for battle”):"
Obadiah,1,2,"“Behold, I will make you small among the nations; You shall be greatly despised."
Obadiah,1,3,"The pride of your heart has deceived you, You who dwell in the clefts of the rock, Whose habitation is high; You who say in your heart, ‘Who will bring me down to the ground?’"
Obadiah,1,4,"Though you ascend as high as the eagle, And though you set your nest among the stars, From there I will bring you down,” says the LORD."
Obadiah,1,5,"“If thieves had come to you, If robbers by night— Oh, how you will be cut off!— Would they not have stolen till they had enough? If grape-gatherers had come to you, Would they not have left some gleanings?"
Obadiah,1,6,"“Oh, how Esau shall be searched out! How his hidden treasures shall be sought after!"
Obadiah,1,7,All the men in your confederacy Shall force you to the border; The men at peace with you Shall deceive you and prevail against you. Those who eat your bread shall lay a trap for you. No one is aware of it.
Obadiah,1,8,"“Will I not in that day,” says the LORD, “Even destroy the wise men from Edom, And understanding from the mountains of Esau?"
Obadiah,1,9,"Then your mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, To the end that everyone from the mountains of Esau May be cut off by slaughter."
Obadiah,1,10,"“For violence against your brother Jacob, Shame shall cover you, And you shall be cut off forever."
Obadiah,1,11,"In the day that you stood on the other side— In the day that strangers carried captive his forces, When foreigners entered his gates And cast lots for Jerusalem— Even you were as one of them."
Obadiah,1,12,“But you should not have gazed on the day of your brother In the day of his captivity; Nor should you have rejoiced over the children of Judah In the day of their destruction; Nor should you have spoken proudly In the day of distress.
Obadiah,1,13,"You should not have entered the gate of My people In the day of their calamity. Indeed, you should not have gazed on their affliction In the day of their calamity, Nor laid hands on their substance In the day of their calamity."
Obadiah,1,14,You should not have stood at the crossroads To cut off those among them who escaped; Nor should you have delivered up those among them who remained In the day of distress.
Obadiah,1,15,"“For the day of the LORD upon all the nations is near; As you have done, it shall be done to you; Your reprisal shall return upon your own head."
Obadiah,1,16,"For as you drank on My holy mountain, So shall all the nations drink continually; Yes, they shall drink, and swallow, And they shall be as though they had never been."
Obadiah,1,17,"“But on Mount Zion there shall be deliverance, And there shall be holiness; The house of Jacob shall possess their possessions."
Obadiah,1,18,"The house of Jacob shall be a fire, And the house of Joseph a flame; But the house of Esau shall be stubble; They shall kindle them and devour them, And no survivor shall remain of the house of Esau,” For the LORD has spoken."
Obadiah,1,19,"The South shall possess the mountains of Esau, And the Lowland shall possess Philistia. They shall possess the fields of Ephraim And the fields of Samaria. Benjamin shall possess Gilead."
Obadiah,1,20,And the captives of this host of the children of Israel Shall possess the land of the Canaanites As far as Zarephath. The captives of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad Shall possess the cities of the South.
Obadiah,1,21,"Then saviors shall come to Mount Zion To judge the mountains of Esau, And the kingdom shall be the LORD’s."
Jonah,1,1,"Now the word of the LORD came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,"
Jonah,1,2,"“Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry out against it; for their wickedness has come up before Me.”"
Jonah,1,3,"But Jonah arose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD. He went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish; so he paid the fare, and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD."
Jonah,1,4,"But the LORD sent out a great wind on the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship was about to be broken up."
Jonah,1,5,"Then the mariners were afraid; and every man cried out to his god, and threw the cargo that was in the ship into the sea, to lighten the load. But Jonah had gone down into the lowest parts of the ship, had lain down, and was fast asleep."
Jonah,1,6,"So the captain came to him, and said to him, “What do you mean, sleeper? Arise, call on your God; perhaps your God will consider us, so that we may not perish.”"
Jonah,1,7,"And they said to one another, “Come, let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this trouble has come upon us.” So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah."
Jonah,1,8,"Then they said to him, “Please tell us! For whose cause is this trouble upon us? What is your occupation? And where do you come from? What is your country? And of what people are you?”"
Jonah,1,9,"So he said to them, “I am a Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.”"
Jonah,1,10,"Then the men were exceedingly afraid, and said to him, “Why have you done this?” For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them."
Jonah,1,11,"Then they said to him, “What shall we do to you that the sea may be calm for us?”—for the sea was growing more tempestuous."
Jonah,1,12,"And he said to them, “Pick me up and throw me into the sea; then the sea will become calm for you. For I know that this great tempest is because of me.”"
Jonah,1,13,"Nevertheless the men rowed hard to return to land, but they could not, for the sea continued to grow more tempestuous against them."
Jonah,1,14,"Therefore they cried out to the LORD and said, “We pray, O LORD, please do not let us perish for this man’s life, and do not charge us with innocent blood; for You, O LORD, have done as it pleased You.”"
Jonah,1,15,"So they picked up Jonah and threw him into the sea, and the sea ceased from its raging."
Jonah,1,16,"Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice to the LORD and took vows."
Jonah,1,17,Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
Jonah,2,1,Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the fish’s belly.
Jonah,2,2,"And he said: “I cried out to the LORD because of my affliction, And He answered me. “Out of the belly of Sheol I cried, And You heard my voice."
Jonah,2,3,"For You cast me into the deep, Into the heart of the seas, And the floods surrounded me; All Your billows and Your waves passed over me."
Jonah,2,4,"Then I said, ‘I have been cast out of Your sight; Yet I will look again toward Your holy temple.’"
Jonah,2,5,"The waters surrounded me, even to my soul; The deep closed around me; Weeds were wrapped around my head."
Jonah,2,6,"I went down to the moorings of the mountains; The earth with its bars closed behind me forever; Yet You have brought up my life from the pit, O LORD, my God."
Jonah,2,7,"“When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the LORD; And my prayer went up to You, Into Your holy temple."
Jonah,2,8,“Those who regard worthless idols Forsake their own Mercy.
Jonah,2,9,But I will sacrifice to You With the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay what I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.”
Jonah,2,10,"So the LORD spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land."
Jonah,3,1,"Now the word of the LORD came to Jonah the second time, saying,"
Jonah,3,2,"“Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach to it the message that I tell you.”"
Jonah,3,3,"So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city, a three-day journey in extent."
Jonah,3,4,"And Jonah began to enter the city on the first day’s walk. Then he cried out and said, “Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!”"
Jonah,3,5,"So the people of Nineveh believed God, proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest to the least of them."
Jonah,3,6,"Then word came to the king of Nineveh; and he arose from his throne and laid aside his robe, covered himself with sackcloth and sat in ashes."
Jonah,3,7,"And he caused it to be proclaimed and published throughout Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; do not let them eat, or drink water."
Jonah,3,8,"But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily to God; yes, let every one turn from his evil way and from the violence that is in his hands."
Jonah,3,9,"Who can tell if God will turn and relent, and turn away from His fierce anger, so that we may not perish?"
Jonah,3,10,"Then God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God relented from the disaster that He had said He would bring upon them, and He did not do it."
Jonah,4,1,"But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he became angry."
Jonah,4,2,"So he prayed to the LORD, and said, “Ah, LORD, was not this what I said when I was still in my country? Therefore I fled previously to Tarshish; for I know that You are a gracious and merciful God, slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, One who relents from doing harm."
Jonah,4,3,"Therefore now, O LORD, please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live!”"
Jonah,4,4,"Then the LORD said, “Is it right for you to be angry?”"
Jonah,4,5,"So Jonah went out of the city and sat on the east side of the city. There he made himself a shelter and sat under it in the shade, till he might see what would become of the city."
Jonah,4,6,"And the LORD God prepared a plant and made it come up over Jonah, that it might be shade for his head to deliver him from his misery. So Jonah was very grateful for the plant."
Jonah,4,7,"But as morning dawned the next day God prepared a worm, and it so damaged the plant that it withered."
Jonah,4,8,"And it happened, when the sun arose, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat on Jonah’s head, so that he grew faint. Then he wished death for himself, and said, “It is better for me to die than to live.”"
Jonah,4,9,"Then God said to Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry about the plant?” And he said, “It is right for me to be angry, even to death!”"
Jonah,4,10,"But the LORD said, “You have had pity on the plant for which you have not labored, nor made it grow, which came up in a night and perished in a night."
Jonah,4,11,"And should I not pity Nineveh, that great city, in which are more than one hundred and twenty thousand persons who cannot discern between their right hand and their left—and much livestock?”"
Matthew,1,1,"The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham:"
Matthew,1,2,"Abraham begot Isaac, Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers."
Matthew,1,3,"Judah begot Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez begot Hezron, and Hezron begot Ram."
Matthew,1,4,"Ram begot Amminadab, Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon."
Matthew,1,5,"Salmon begot Boaz by Rahab, Boaz begot Obed by Ruth, Obed begot Jesse,"
Matthew,1,6,and Jesse begot David the king. David the king begot Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah.
Matthew,1,7,"Solomon begot Rehoboam, Rehoboam begot Abijah, and Abijah begot Asa."
Matthew,1,8,"Asa begot Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat begot Joram, and Joram begot Uzziah."
Matthew,1,9,"Uzziah begot Jotham, Jotham begot Ahaz, and Ahaz begot Hezekiah."
Matthew,1,10,"Hezekiah begot Manasseh, Manasseh begot Amon, and Amon begot Josiah."
Matthew,1,11,Josiah begot Jeconiah and his brothers about the time they were carried away to Babylon.
Matthew,1,12,"And after they were brought to Babylon, Jeconiah begot Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begot Zerubbabel."
Matthew,1,13,"Zerubbabel begot Abiud, Abiud begot Eliakim, and Eliakim begot Azor."
Matthew,1,14,"Azor begot Zadok, Zadok begot Achim, and Achim begot Eliud."
Matthew,1,15,"Eliud begot Eleazar, Eleazar begot Matthan, and Matthan begot Jacob."
Matthew,1,16,"And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ."
Matthew,1,17,"So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, from David until the captivity in Babylon are fourteen generations, and from the captivity in Babylon until the Christ are fourteen generations."
Matthew,1,18,"Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit."
Matthew,1,19,"Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not wanting to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly."
Matthew,1,20,"But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit."
Matthew,1,21,"And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name JESUS, for He will save His people from their sins.”"
Matthew,1,22,"So all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying:"
Matthew,1,23,"“Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,” which is translated, “God with us.”"
Matthew,1,24,"Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took to him his wife,"
Matthew,1,25,and did not know her till she had brought forth her firstborn Son. And he called His name JESUS.
Matthew,2,1,"Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,"
Matthew,2,2,"saying, “Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him.”"
Matthew,2,3,"When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him."
Matthew,2,4,"And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born."
Matthew,2,5,"So they said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet:"
Matthew,2,6,"‘But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, Are not the least among the rulers of Judah; For out of you shall come a Ruler Who will shepherd My people Israel.’”"
Matthew,2,7,"Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, determined from them what time the star appeared."
Matthew,2,8,"And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and search carefully for the young Child, and when you have found Him, bring back word to me, that I may come and worship Him also.”"
Matthew,2,9,"When they heard the king, they departed; and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was."
Matthew,2,10,"When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy."
Matthew,2,11,"And when they had come into the house, they saw the young Child with Mary His mother, and fell down and worshiped Him. And when they had opened their treasures, they presented gifts to Him: gold, frankincense, and myrrh."
Matthew,2,12,"Then, being divinely warned in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed for their own country another way."
Matthew,2,13,"Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Arise, take the young Child and His mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I bring you word; for Herod will seek the young Child to destroy Him.”"
Matthew,2,14,"When he arose, he took the young Child and His mother by night and departed for Egypt,"
Matthew,2,15,"and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt I called My Son.”"
Matthew,2,16,"Then Herod, when he saw that he was deceived by the wise men, was exceedingly angry; and he sent forth and put to death all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men."
Matthew,2,17,"Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:"
Matthew,2,18,"“A voice was heard in Ramah, Lamentation, weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, Refusing to be comforted, Because they are no more.”"
Matthew,2,19,"Now when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,"
Matthew,2,20,"saying, “Arise, take the young Child and His mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the young Child’s life are dead.”"
Matthew,2,21,"Then he arose, took the young Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel."
Matthew,2,22,"But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea instead of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned by God in a dream, he turned aside into the region of Galilee."
Matthew,2,23,"And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, “He shall be called a Nazarene.”"
Matthew,3,1,"In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea,"
Matthew,3,2,"and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!”"
Matthew,3,3,"For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying: “The voice of one crying in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the LORD; Make His paths straight.’”"
Matthew,3,4,"Now John himself was clothed in camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey."
Matthew,3,5,"Then Jerusalem, all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him"
Matthew,3,6,"and were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins."
Matthew,3,7,"But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, “Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Matthew,3,8,"Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance,"
Matthew,3,9,"and do not think to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones."
Matthew,3,10,And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Matthew,3,11,"I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
Matthew,3,12,"His winnowing fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clean out His threshing floor, and gather His wheat into the barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”"
Matthew,3,13,Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him.
Matthew,3,14,"And John tried to prevent Him, saying, “I need to be baptized by You, and are You coming to me?”"
Matthew,3,15,"But Jesus answered and said to him, “Permit it to be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he allowed Him."
Matthew,3,16,"When He had been baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon Him."
Matthew,3,17,"And suddenly a voice came from heaven, saying, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”"
Matthew,4,1,Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
Matthew,4,2,"And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry."
Matthew,4,3,"Now when the tempter came to Him, he said, “If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.”"
Matthew,4,4,"But He answered and said, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.’”"
Matthew,4,5,"Then the devil took Him up into the holy city, set Him on the pinnacle of the temple,"
Matthew,4,6,"and said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down. For it is written: ‘He shall give His angels charge over you,’ and, ‘In their hands they shall bear you up, Lest you dash your foot against a stone.’”"
Matthew,4,7,"Jesus said to him, “It is written again, ‘You shall not tempt the LORD your God.’”"
Matthew,4,8,"Again, the devil took Him up on an exceedingly high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory."
Matthew,4,9,"And he said to Him, “All these things I will give You if You will fall down and worship me.”"
Matthew,4,10,"Then Jesus said to him, “Away with you, Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the LORD your God, and Him only you shall serve.’”"
Matthew,4,11,"Then the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him."
Matthew,4,12,"Now when Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, He departed to Galilee."
Matthew,4,13,"And leaving Nazareth, He came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,"
Matthew,4,14,"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:"
Matthew,4,15,"“The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, By the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles:"
Matthew,4,16,"The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light, And upon those who sat in the region and shadow of death Light has dawned.”"
Matthew,4,17,"From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”"
Matthew,4,18,"And Jesus, walking by the Sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen."
Matthew,4,19,"Then He said to them, “Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.”"
Matthew,4,20,They immediately left their nets and followed Him.
Matthew,4,21,"Going on from there, He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. He called them,"
Matthew,4,22,"and immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him."
Matthew,4,23,"And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease among the people."
Matthew,4,24,"Then His fame went throughout all Syria; and they brought to Him all sick people who were afflicted with various diseases and torments, and those who were demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics; and He healed them."
Matthew,4,25,"Great multitudes followed Him—from Galilee, and from Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan."
Matthew,5,1,"And seeing the multitudes, He went up on a mountain, and when He was seated His disciples came to Him."
Matthew,5,2,"Then He opened His mouth and taught them, saying:"
Matthew,5,3,"“Blessed are the poor in spirit, For theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,5,4,"Blessed are those who mourn, For they shall be comforted."
Matthew,5,5,"Blessed are the meek, For they shall inherit the earth."
Matthew,5,6,"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, For they shall be filled."
Matthew,5,7,"Blessed are the merciful, For they shall obtain mercy."
Matthew,5,8,"Blessed are the pure in heart, For they shall see God."
Matthew,5,9,"Blessed are the peacemakers, For they shall be called sons of God."
Matthew,5,10,"Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, For theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,5,11,"“Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake."
Matthew,5,12,"Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you."
Matthew,5,13,"“You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men."
Matthew,5,14,“You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.
Matthew,5,15,"Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house."
Matthew,5,16,"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven."
Matthew,5,17,“Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill.
Matthew,5,18,"For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled."
Matthew,5,19,"Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,5,20,"For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,5,21,"“You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not murder, and whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.’"
Matthew,5,22,"But I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment. And whoever says to his brother, ‘Raca!’ shall be in danger of the council. But whoever says, ‘You fool!’ shall be in danger of hell fire."
Matthew,5,23,"Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,"
Matthew,5,24,"leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift."
Matthew,5,25,"Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him, lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be thrown into prison."
Matthew,5,26,"Assuredly, I say to you, you will by no means get out of there till you have paid the last penny."
Matthew,5,27,"“You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’"
Matthew,5,28,But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
Matthew,5,29,"If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell."
Matthew,5,30,"And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell."
Matthew,5,31,"“Furthermore it has been said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.’"
Matthew,5,32,But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife for any reason except sexual immorality causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a woman who is divorced commits adultery.
Matthew,5,33,"“Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.’"
Matthew,5,34,"But I say to you, do not swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is God’s throne;"
Matthew,5,35,"nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King."
Matthew,5,36,"Nor shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black."
Matthew,5,37,"But let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes,’ and your ‘No,’ ‘No.’ For whatever is more than these is from the evil one."
Matthew,5,38,"“You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’"
Matthew,5,39,"But I tell you not to resist an evil person. But whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also."
Matthew,5,40,"If anyone wants to sue you and take away your tunic, let him have your cloak also."
Matthew,5,41,"And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two."
Matthew,5,42,"Give to him who asks you, and from him who wants to borrow from you do not turn away."
Matthew,5,43,"“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’"
Matthew,5,44,"But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you,"
Matthew,5,45,"that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust."
Matthew,5,46,"For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?"
Matthew,5,47,"And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more than others? Do not even the tax collectors do so?"
Matthew,5,48,"Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect."
Matthew,6,1,"“Take heed that you do not do your charitable deeds before men, to be seen by them. Otherwise you have no reward from your Father in heaven."
Matthew,6,2,"Therefore, when you do a charitable deed, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory from men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward."
Matthew,6,3,"But when you do a charitable deed, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,"
Matthew,6,4,that your charitable deed may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will Himself reward you openly.
Matthew,6,5,"“And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward."
Matthew,6,6,"But you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly."
Matthew,6,7,"And when you pray, do not use vain repetitions as the heathen do. For they think that they will be heard for their many words."
Matthew,6,8,“Therefore do not be like them. For your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him.
Matthew,6,9,"In this manner, therefore, pray: Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be Your name."
Matthew,6,10,Your kingdom come. Your will be done On earth as it is in heaven.
Matthew,6,11,Give us this day our daily bread.
Matthew,6,12,"And forgive us our debts, As we forgive our debtors."
Matthew,6,13,"And do not lead us into temptation, But deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen."
Matthew,6,14,"“For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you."
Matthew,6,15,"But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."
Matthew,6,16,"“Moreover, when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, with a sad countenance. For they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to be fasting. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward."
Matthew,6,17,"But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,"
Matthew,6,18,"so that you do not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly."
Matthew,6,19,"“Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal;"
Matthew,6,20,"but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal."
Matthew,6,21,"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
Matthew,6,22,"“The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is good, your whole body will be full of light."
Matthew,6,23,"But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!"
Matthew,6,24,"“No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon."
Matthew,6,25,"“Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?"
Matthew,6,26,"Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?"
Matthew,6,27,Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature?
Matthew,6,28,"“So why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin;"
Matthew,6,29,and yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
Matthew,6,30,"Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?"
Matthew,6,31,"“Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’"
Matthew,6,32,For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
Matthew,6,33,"But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you."
Matthew,6,34,"Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble."
Matthew,7,1,"“Judge not, that you be not judged."
Matthew,7,2,"For with what judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you."
Matthew,7,3,"And why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye?"
Matthew,7,4,"Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me remove the speck from your eye’; and look, a plank is in your own eye?"
Matthew,7,5,"Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye."
Matthew,7,6,"“Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces."
Matthew,7,7,"“Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you."
Matthew,7,8,"For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened."
Matthew,7,9,"Or what man is there among you who, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?"
Matthew,7,10,"Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent?"
Matthew,7,11,"If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!"
Matthew,7,12,"Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets."
Matthew,7,13,"“Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many who go in by it."
Matthew,7,14,"Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it."
Matthew,7,15,"“Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves."
Matthew,7,16,You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles?
Matthew,7,17,"Even so, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit."
Matthew,7,18,"A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit."
Matthew,7,19,Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Matthew,7,20,Therefore by their fruits you will know them.
Matthew,7,21,"“Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven."
Matthew,7,22,"Many will say to Me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?’"
Matthew,7,23,"And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!’"
Matthew,7,24,"“Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock:"
Matthew,7,25,"and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock."
Matthew,7,26,"“But everyone who hears these sayings of Mine, and does not do them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand:"
Matthew,7,27,"and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it fell. And great was its fall.”"
Matthew,7,28,"And so it was, when Jesus had ended these sayings, that the people were astonished at His teaching,"
Matthew,7,29,"for He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes."
Matthew,8,1,"When He had come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed Him."
Matthew,8,2,"And behold, a leper came and worshiped Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.”"
Matthew,8,3,"Then Jesus put out His hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing; be cleansed.” Immediately his leprosy was cleansed."
Matthew,8,4,"And Jesus said to him, “See that you tell no one; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”"
Matthew,8,5,"Now when Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, pleading with Him,"
Matthew,8,6,"saying, “Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, dreadfully tormented.”"
Matthew,8,7,"And Jesus said to him, “I will come and heal him.”"
Matthew,8,8,"The centurion answered and said, “Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof. But only speak a word, and my servant will be healed."
Matthew,8,9,"For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”"
Matthew,8,10,"When Jesus heard it, He marveled, and said to those who followed, “Assuredly, I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!"
Matthew,8,11,"And I say to you that many will come from east and west, and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,8,12,But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”
Matthew,8,13,"Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go your way; and as you have believed, so let it be done for you.” And his servant was healed that same hour."
Matthew,8,14,"Now when Jesus had come into Peter’s house, He saw his wife’s mother lying sick with a fever."
Matthew,8,15,"So He touched her hand, and the fever left her. And she arose and served them."
Matthew,8,16,"When evening had come, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed. And He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick,"
Matthew,8,17,"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying: “He Himself took our infirmities And bore our sicknesses.”"
Matthew,8,18,"And when Jesus saw great multitudes about Him, He gave a command to depart to the other side."
Matthew,8,19,"Then a certain scribe came and said to Him, “Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.”"
Matthew,8,20,"And Jesus said to him, “Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.”"
Matthew,8,21,"Then another of His disciples said to Him, “Lord, let me first go and bury my father.”"
Matthew,8,22,"But Jesus said to him, “Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”"
Matthew,8,23,"Now when He got into a boat, His disciples followed Him."
Matthew,8,24,"And suddenly a great tempest arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves. But He was asleep."
Matthew,8,25,"Then His disciples came to Him and awoke Him, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!”"
Matthew,8,26,"But He said to them, “Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?” Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm."
Matthew,8,27,"So the men marveled, saying, “Who can this be, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?”"
Matthew,8,28,"When He had come to the other side, to the country of the Gergesenes, there met Him two demon-possessed men, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass that way."
Matthew,8,29,"And suddenly they cried out, saying, “What have we to do with You, Jesus, You Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?”"
Matthew,8,30,Now a good way off from them there was a herd of many swine feeding.
Matthew,8,31,"So the demons begged Him, saying, “If You cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of swine.”"
Matthew,8,32,"And He said to them, “Go.” So when they had come out, they went into the herd of swine. And suddenly the whole herd of swine ran violently down the steep place into the sea, and perished in the water."
Matthew,8,33,"Then those who kept them fled; and they went away into the city and told everything, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men."
Matthew,8,34,"And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to depart from their region."
Matthew,9,1,"So He got into a boat, crossed over, and came to His own city."
Matthew,9,2,"Then behold, they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, “Son, be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven you.”"
Matthew,9,3,"And at once some of the scribes said within themselves, “This Man blasphemes!”"
Matthew,9,4,"But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, “Why do you think evil in your hearts?"
Matthew,9,5,"For which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Arise and walk’?"
Matthew,9,6,"But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins”—then He said to the paralytic, “Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.”"
Matthew,9,7,And he arose and departed to his house.
Matthew,9,8,"Now when the multitudes saw it, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such power to men."
Matthew,9,9,"As Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, “Follow Me.” So he arose and followed Him."
Matthew,9,10,"Now it happened, as Jesus sat at the table in the house, that behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Him and His disciples."
Matthew,9,11,"And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to His disciples, “Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”"
Matthew,9,12,"When Jesus heard that, He said to them, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick."
Matthew,9,13,"But go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice.’ For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.”"
Matthew,9,14,"Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your disciples do not fast?”"
Matthew,9,15,"And Jesus said to them, “Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast."
Matthew,9,16,"No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch pulls away from the garment, and the tear is made worse."
Matthew,9,17,"Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins, or else the wineskins break, the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are ruined. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.”"
Matthew,9,18,"While He spoke these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped Him, saying, “My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her and she will live.”"
Matthew,9,19,"So Jesus arose and followed him, and so did His disciples."
Matthew,9,20,"And suddenly, a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years came from behind and touched the hem of His garment."
Matthew,9,21,"For she said to herself, “If only I may touch His garment, I shall be made well.”"
Matthew,9,22,"But Jesus turned around, and when He saw her He said, “Be of good cheer, daughter; your faith has made you well.” And the woman was made well from that hour."
Matthew,9,23,"When Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd wailing,"
Matthew,9,24,"He said to them, “Make room, for the girl is not dead, but sleeping.” And they ridiculed Him."
Matthew,9,25,"But when the crowd was put outside, He went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose."
Matthew,9,26,And the report of this went out into all that land.
Matthew,9,27,"When Jesus departed from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, “Son of David, have mercy on us!”"
Matthew,9,28,"And when He had come into the house, the blind men came to Him. And Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They said to Him, “Yes, Lord.”"
Matthew,9,29,"Then He touched their eyes, saying, “According to your faith let it be to you.”"
Matthew,9,30,"And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, saying, “See that no one knows it.”"
Matthew,9,31,"But when they had departed, they spread the news about Him in all that country."
Matthew,9,32,"As they went out, behold, they brought to Him a man, mute and demon-possessed."
Matthew,9,33,"And when the demon was cast out, the mute spoke. And the multitudes marveled, saying, “It was never seen like this in Israel!”"
Matthew,9,34,"But the Pharisees said, “He casts out demons by the ruler of the demons.”"
Matthew,9,35,"Then Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people."
Matthew,9,36,"But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were weary and scattered, like sheep having no shepherd."
Matthew,9,37,"Then He said to His disciples, “The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
Matthew,9,38,Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.”
Matthew,10,1,"And when He had called His twelve disciples to Him, He gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease."
Matthew,10,2,"Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;"
Matthew,10,3,"Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;"
Matthew,10,4,"Simon the Cananite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him."
Matthew,10,5,"These twelve Jesus sent out and commanded them, saying: “Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter a city of the Samaritans."
Matthew,10,6,But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Matthew,10,7,"And as you go, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand.’"
Matthew,10,8,"Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give."
Matthew,10,9,"Provide neither gold nor silver nor copper in your money belts,"
Matthew,10,10,"nor bag for your journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor staffs; for a worker is worthy of his food."
Matthew,10,11,"“Now whatever city or town you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay there till you go out."
Matthew,10,12,"And when you go into a household, greet it."
Matthew,10,13,"If the household is worthy, let your peace come upon it. But if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you."
Matthew,10,14,"And whoever will not receive you nor hear your words, when you depart from that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet."
Matthew,10,15,"Assuredly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!"
Matthew,10,16,"“Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves."
Matthew,10,17,"But beware of men, for they will deliver you up to councils and scourge you in their synagogues."
Matthew,10,18,"You will be brought before governors and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles."
Matthew,10,19,"But when they deliver you up, do not worry about how or what you should speak. For it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak;"
Matthew,10,20,"for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you."
Matthew,10,21,"“Now brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death."
Matthew,10,22,And you will be hated by all for My name’s sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved.
Matthew,10,23,"When they persecute you in this city, flee to another. For assuredly, I say to you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes."
Matthew,10,24,"“A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master."
Matthew,10,25,"It is enough for a disciple that he be like his teacher, and a servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more will they call those of his household!"
Matthew,10,26,"Therefore do not fear them. For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, and hidden that will not be known."
Matthew,10,27,"“Whatever I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; and what you hear in the ear, preach on the housetops."
Matthew,10,28,And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
Matthew,10,29,Are not two sparrows sold for a copper coin? And not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father’s will.
Matthew,10,30,But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
Matthew,10,31,Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.
Matthew,10,32,"“Therefore whoever confesses Me before men, him I will also confess before My Father who is in heaven."
Matthew,10,33,"But whoever denies Me before men, him I will also deny before My Father who is in heaven."
Matthew,10,34,“Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword.
Matthew,10,35,"For I have come to ‘set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law’;"
Matthew,10,36,and ‘a man’s enemies will be those of his own household.’
Matthew,10,37,He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.
Matthew,10,38,And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.
Matthew,10,39,"He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for My sake will find it."
Matthew,10,40,"“He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me."
Matthew,10,41,He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward. And he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.
Matthew,10,42,"And whoever gives one of these little ones only a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple, assuredly, I say to you, he shall by no means lose his reward.”"
Matthew,11,1,"Now it came to pass, when Jesus finished commanding His twelve disciples, that He departed from there to teach and to preach in their cities."
Matthew,11,2,"And when John had heard in prison about the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples"
Matthew,11,3,"and said to Him, “Are You the Coming One, or do we look for another?”"
Matthew,11,4,"Jesus answered and said to them, “Go and tell John the things which you hear and see:"
Matthew,11,5,The blind see and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear; the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them.
Matthew,11,6,And blessed is he who is not offended because of Me.”
Matthew,11,7,"As they departed, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
Matthew,11,8,"But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Indeed, those who wear soft clothing are in kings’ houses."
Matthew,11,9,"But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet."
Matthew,11,10,"For this is he of whom it is written: ‘Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, Who will prepare Your way before You.’"
Matthew,11,11,"“Assuredly, I say to you, among those born of women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist; but he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
Matthew,11,12,"And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force."
Matthew,11,13,For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
Matthew,11,14,"And if you are willing to receive it, he is Elijah who is to come."
Matthew,11,15,"He who has ears to hear, let him hear!"
Matthew,11,16,"“But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their companions,"
Matthew,11,17,"and saying: ‘We played the flute for you, And you did not dance; We mourned to you, And you did not lament.’"
Matthew,11,18,"For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’"
Matthew,11,19,"The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Look, a glutton and a winebibber, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom is justified by her children.”"
Matthew,11,20,"Then He began to rebuke the cities in which most of His mighty works had been done, because they did not repent:"
Matthew,11,21,"“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."
Matthew,11,22,"But I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you."
Matthew,11,23,"And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades; for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day."
Matthew,11,24,But I say to you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you.”
Matthew,11,25,"At that time Jesus answered and said, “I thank You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and prudent and have revealed them to babes."
Matthew,11,26,"Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight."
Matthew,11,27,"All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father. Nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal Him."
Matthew,11,28,"Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
Matthew,11,29,"Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls."
Matthew,11,30,For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”
Matthew,12,1,"At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. And His disciples were hungry, and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat."
Matthew,12,2,"And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to Him, “Look, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!”"
Matthew,12,3,"But He said to them, “Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him:"
Matthew,12,4,"how he entered the house of God and ate the showbread which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?"
Matthew,12,5,"Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are blameless?"
Matthew,12,6,Yet I say to you that in this place there is One greater than the temple.
Matthew,12,7,"But if you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the guiltless."
Matthew,12,8,For the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”
Matthew,12,9,"Now when He had departed from there, He went into their synagogue."
Matthew,12,10,"And behold, there was a man who had a withered hand. And they asked Him, saying, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”—that they might accuse Him."
Matthew,12,11,"Then He said to them, “What man is there among you who has one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not lay hold of it and lift it out?"
Matthew,12,12,Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep? Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.”
Matthew,12,13,"Then He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and it was restored as whole as the other."
Matthew,12,14,"Then the Pharisees went out and plotted against Him, how they might destroy Him."
Matthew,12,15,"But when Jesus knew it, He withdrew from there. And great multitudes followed Him, and He healed them all."
Matthew,12,16,"Yet He warned them not to make Him known,"
Matthew,12,17,"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:"
Matthew,12,18,"“Behold! My Servant whom I have chosen, My Beloved in whom My soul is well pleased! I will put My Spirit upon Him, And He will declare justice to the Gentiles."
Matthew,12,19,"He will not quarrel nor cry out, Nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets."
Matthew,12,20,"A bruised reed He will not break, And smoking flax He will not quench, Till He sends forth justice to victory;"
Matthew,12,21,And in His name Gentiles will trust.”
Matthew,12,22,"Then one was brought to Him who was demon-possessed, blind and mute; and He healed him, so that the blind and mute man both spoke and saw."
Matthew,12,23,"And all the multitudes were amazed and said, “Could this be the Son of David?”"
Matthew,12,24,"Now when the Pharisees heard it they said, “This fellow does not cast out demons except by Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons.”"
Matthew,12,25,"But Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them: “Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
Matthew,12,26,"If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?"
Matthew,12,27,"And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges."
Matthew,12,28,"But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, surely the kingdom of God has come upon you."
Matthew,12,29,"Or how can one enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house."
Matthew,12,30,"He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters abroad."
Matthew,12,31,"“Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men."
Matthew,12,32,"Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come."
Matthew,12,33,"“Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or else make the tree bad and its fruit bad; for a tree is known by its fruit."
Matthew,12,34,"Brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks."
Matthew,12,35,"A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things."
Matthew,12,36,"But I say to you that for every idle word men may speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment."
Matthew,12,37,"For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”"
Matthew,12,38,"Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.”"
Matthew,12,39,"But He answered and said to them, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
Matthew,12,40,"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth."
Matthew,12,41,"The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and indeed a greater than Jonah is here."
Matthew,12,42,"The queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and indeed a greater than Solomon is here."
Matthew,12,43,"“When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none."
Matthew,12,44,"Then he says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’ And when he comes, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order."
Matthew,12,45,"Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first. So shall it also be with this wicked generation.”"
Matthew,12,46,"While He was still talking to the multitudes, behold, His mother and brothers stood outside, seeking to speak with Him."
Matthew,12,47,"Then one said to Him, “Look, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak with You.”"
Matthew,12,48,"But He answered and said to the one who told Him, “Who is My mother and who are My brothers?”"
Matthew,12,49,"And He stretched out His hand toward His disciples and said, “Here are My mother and My brothers!"
Matthew,12,50,For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven is My brother and sister and mother.”
Matthew,13,1,On the same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea.
Matthew,13,2,"And great multitudes were gathered together to Him, so that He got into a boat and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore."
Matthew,13,3,"Then He spoke many things to them in parables, saying: “Behold, a sower went out to sow."
Matthew,13,4,"And as he sowed, some seed fell by the wayside; and the birds came and devoured them."
Matthew,13,5,"Some fell on stony places, where they did not have much earth; and they immediately sprang up because they had no depth of earth."
Matthew,13,6,"But when the sun was up they were scorched, and because they had no root they withered away."
Matthew,13,7,"And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up and choked them."
Matthew,13,8,"But others fell on good ground and yielded a crop: some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty."
Matthew,13,9,"He who has ears to hear, let him hear!”"
Matthew,13,10,"And the disciples came and said to Him, “Why do You speak to them in parables?”"
Matthew,13,11,"He answered and said to them, “Because it has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given."
Matthew,13,12,"For whoever has, to him more will be given, and he will have abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him."
Matthew,13,13,"Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand."
Matthew,13,14,"And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says: ‘Hearing you will hear and shall not understand, And seeing you will see and not perceive;"
Matthew,13,15,"For the hearts of this people have grown dull. Their ears are hard of hearing, And their eyes they have closed, Lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, Lest they should understand with their hearts and turn, So that I should heal them.’"
Matthew,13,16,"But blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears for they hear;"
Matthew,13,17,"for assuredly, I say to you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it."
Matthew,13,18,“Therefore hear the parable of the sower:
Matthew,13,19,"When anyone hears the word of the kingdom, and does not understand it, then the wicked one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is he who received seed by the wayside."
Matthew,13,20,"But he who received the seed on stony places, this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy;"
Matthew,13,21,"yet he has no root in himself, but endures only for a while. For when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles."
Matthew,13,22,"Now he who received seed among the thorns is he who hears the word, and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful."
Matthew,13,23,"But he who received seed on the good ground is he who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and produces: some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.”"
Matthew,13,24,"Another parable He put forth to them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field;"
Matthew,13,25,"but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way."
Matthew,13,26,"But when the grain had sprouted and produced a crop, then the tares also appeared."
Matthew,13,27,"So the servants of the owner came and said to him, ‘Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have tares?’"
Matthew,13,28,"He said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’ The servants said to him, ‘Do you want us then to go and gather them up?’"
Matthew,13,29,"But he said, ‘No, lest while you gather up the tares you also uproot the wheat with them."
Matthew,13,30,"Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, “First gather together the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.”’”"
Matthew,13,31,"Another parable He put forth to them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field,"
Matthew,13,32,"which indeed is the least of all the seeds; but when it is grown it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.”"
Matthew,13,33,"Another parable He spoke to them: “The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till it was all leavened.”"
Matthew,13,34,"All these things Jesus spoke to the multitude in parables; and without a parable He did not speak to them,"
Matthew,13,35,"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: “I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things kept secret from the foundation of the world.”"
Matthew,13,36,"Then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.”"
Matthew,13,37,He answered and said to them: “He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.
Matthew,13,38,"The field is the world, the good seeds are the sons of the kingdom, but the tares are the sons of the wicked one."
Matthew,13,39,"The enemy who sowed them is the devil, the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels."
Matthew,13,40,"Therefore as the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of this age."
Matthew,13,41,"The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and those who practice lawlessness,"
Matthew,13,42,and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew,13,43,"Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!"
Matthew,13,44,"“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and for joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field."
Matthew,13,45,"“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls,"
Matthew,13,46,"who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it."
Matthew,13,47,"“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet that was cast into the sea and gathered some of every kind,"
Matthew,13,48,"which, when it was full, they drew to shore; and they sat down and gathered the good into vessels, but threw the bad away."
Matthew,13,49,"So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come forth, separate the wicked from among the just,"
Matthew,13,50,and cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.”
Matthew,13,51,"Jesus said to them, “Have you understood all these things?” They said to Him, “Yes, Lord.”"
Matthew,13,52,"Then He said to them, “Therefore every scribe instructed concerning the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old.”"
Matthew,13,53,"Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, that He departed from there."
Matthew,13,54,"When He had come to His own country, He taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, “Where did this Man get this wisdom and these mighty works?"
Matthew,13,55,"Is this not the carpenter’s son? Is not His mother called Mary? And His brothers James, Joses, Simon, and Judas?"
Matthew,13,56,"And His sisters, are they not all with us? Where then did this Man get all these things?”"
Matthew,13,57,"So they were offended at Him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.”"
Matthew,13,58,Now He did not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
Matthew,14,1,At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report about Jesus
Matthew,14,2,"and said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him.”"
Matthew,14,3,"For Herod had laid hold of John and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife."
Matthew,14,4,"Because John had said to him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”"
Matthew,14,5,"And although he wanted to put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet."
Matthew,14,6,"But when Herod’s birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod."
Matthew,14,7,Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.
Matthew,14,8,"So she, having been prompted by her mother, said, “Give me John the Baptist’s head here on a platter.”"
Matthew,14,9,"And the king was sorry; nevertheless, because of the oaths and because of those who sat with him, he commanded it to be given to her."
Matthew,14,10,So he sent and had John beheaded in prison.
Matthew,14,11,"And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother."
Matthew,14,12,"Then his disciples came and took away the body and buried it, and went and told Jesus."
Matthew,14,13,"When Jesus heard it, He departed from there by boat to a deserted place by Himself. But when the multitudes heard it, they followed Him on foot from the cities."
Matthew,14,14,"And when Jesus went out He saw a great multitude; and He was moved with compassion for them, and healed their sick."
Matthew,14,15,"When it was evening, His disciples came to Him, saying, “This is a deserted place, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.”"
Matthew,14,16,"But Jesus said to them, “They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.”"
Matthew,14,17,"And they said to Him, “We have here only five loaves and two fish.”"
Matthew,14,18,"He said, “Bring them here to Me.”"
Matthew,14,19,"Then He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass. And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitudes."
Matthew,14,20,"So they all ate and were filled, and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments that remained."
Matthew,14,21,"Now those who had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children."
Matthew,14,22,"Immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to the other side, while He sent the multitudes away."
Matthew,14,23,"And when He had sent the multitudes away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. Now when evening came, He was alone there."
Matthew,14,24,"But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary."
Matthew,14,25,"Now in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea."
Matthew,14,26,"And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, “It is a ghost!” And they cried out for fear."
Matthew,14,27,"But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, “Be of good cheer! It is I; do not be afraid.”"
Matthew,14,28,"And Peter answered Him and said, “Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.”"
Matthew,14,29,"So He said, “Come.” And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus."
Matthew,14,30,"But when he saw that the wind was boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!”"
Matthew,14,31,"And immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him, and said to him, “O you of little faith, why did you doubt?”"
Matthew,14,32,"And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased."
Matthew,14,33,"Then those who were in the boat came and worshiped Him, saying, “Truly You are the Son of God.”"
Matthew,14,34,"When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret."
Matthew,14,35,"And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent out into all that surrounding region, brought to Him all who were sick,"
Matthew,14,36,and begged Him that they might only touch the hem of His garment. And as many as touched it were made perfectly well.
Matthew,15,1,"Then the scribes and Pharisees who were from Jerusalem came to Jesus, saying,"
